Variational Monte Carlo (VMC), diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) and a number of other advanced QMC algorithms are implemented. Orbital space auxiliary field QMC (AFQMC) has recently been added. By directly solving the Schrodinger equation, QMC methods offer greater accuracy than methods such as density functional theory, but at a trade-off of much greater computational expense.\n\nPrebuilt executables are provided at /soft/applications/qmcpack.\nThe directory of each installation also includes a job submission script example qmcpack-polaris.job.\nUpdate build recipe is provided on GitHub."

                "Use TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.  Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.  When possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention.\n\nUse XLA compilation on your code.  XLA is the Accelerated Linear Algebra library that is available in tensorFlow and critical in software like JAX.  XLA will compile a tf.Graph object, generated with tf.function or similar, and perform optimizations like operation-fusion.  XLA can give impressive performance boosts with almost no user changes except to set an environment variable TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2.  If your code is complex, or has dynamically sized tensors (tensors where the shape changes every iteration), XLA can be detrimental: the overhead for compiling functions can be large enough to mitigate performance improvements.  XLA is particularly powerful when combined with reduced precision, yielding speedups > 100% in some models.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nTensorFlow is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with tensorFlow has been seen with horovod in particular.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation.  Some polaris specific details that may be helpful to you:\n\nCPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.  In particular, we encourage users to try their scaling measurements with the following settings:\n\nSet the environment variable NCCL_COLLNET_ENABLE=1",

This consists of running the ParaView client on your local resource, and the ParaView server on the Polaris compute nodes. The ParaView client needs to first be installed on your local resource, and needs to match the version that you run on Polaris.\n\nThere are multiple versions of ParaView installed on Polaris. To find the versions of ParaView currently available on Polaris run the following command on a login node: \nmodule use /soft/modulefiles\nmodule avail paraview\n\nBinary and source packages of the ParaView client for Linux, MacOS, and Windows are available from the ParaView Download Page.\n\nConnecting to the ParaView server on Polaris\n\nThis section describes how to launch the ParaView server on Polaris from a local ParaView client.\n\nStart ParaView Client\n\nFirst, launch the ParaView client on your local resource. You will need to configure some server settings in the client. This initial set up should only need to be done once, and can be reused each time you want to run ParaView on Polaris.\n\nServer Configuration\n\n1. Select Connect\n\nFrom the ParaView client choose to connect to a server by either clicking on the \"Connect\" icon in the menu bar\n\nor selecting File->Connect from the main menu\n\n2. Set Up Servers (first time only)\n\nThe first time you want to run a server on Polaris and have it connect to your local ParaView client, you will need to set up a Server. Once this server is set up, you can reuse it each time you run the ParaView client with the ParaView server on Polaris.\n\nKitware, the developers of ParaView, maintain a database of server configurations which you can retrieve through the ParaView client. In the File->Connect menu press the button named \"Fetch Servers\" and select POLARIS@ANL. Windows users should select \"windows to POLARIS@ANL\". Press \"Import Selected\"\n\n3. Use ParaView",

The craype-x86-milan module is expected to be made default once a newer nvhpc version (e.g. 22.5) is made the default.\n\ncraype-accel-nvidia80: This module adds compiler flags to enable GPU acceleration for NVHPC compilers along with gpu-enabled MPI libraries as it is assumed that the majority of applications to be compiled on Polaris will target the GPUs for acceleration. Users building cpu-only applications may find it useful to unload this module to silence \"gpu code generation\" warnings.\n\nMixed C/C++ & Fortran Applications",

If build your application is problematic for some reason (e.g. absence of a GPU), then users are encouraged to build and test applications directly on one of the Polaris compute nodes via an interactive job. The discussion below makes use of the NVHPC compilers in the default environment as illustrative examples. Similar examples for other compilers on Polaris are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo.\n\nCPU MPI+OpenMP Example\n\nOne of the first useful tasks with any new machine, scheduler, and job launcher is to ensure one is binding MPI ranks and OpenMP threads to the host cpu as intended. A simple HelloWorld MPI+OpenMP example is available here to get started with.\n\nThe application can be straightforwardly compiled using the Cray compiler wrappers.\nCC -fopenmp main.cpp -o hello_affinity\n\nThe executable hello_affinity can then be launched in a job script (or directly in shell of interactive job) using mpiexec as discussed here.\n\n```\n\n!/bin/sh\n\nPBS -l select=1:system=polaris\n\nPBS -l place=scatter\n\nPBS -l walltime=0:30:00\n\nPBS -l filesystems=home\n\nMPI example w/ 16 MPI ranks per node spread evenly across cores\n\nNNODES=wc -l < $PBS_NODEFILE\nNRANKS_PER_NODE=16\nNDEPTH=4\nNTHREADS=1\n\nNTOTRANKS=$(( NNODES * NRANKS_PER_NODE ))\necho \"NUM_OF_NODES= ${NNODES} TOTAL_NUM_RANKS= ${NTOTRANKS} RANKS_PER_NODE= ${NRANKS_PER_NODE} THREADS_PER_RANK= ${NTHREADS}\"\n\nmpiexec -n ${NTOTRANKS} --ppn ${NRANKS_PER_NODE} --depth=${NDEPTH} --cpu-bind depth ./hello_affinity\n```\n\nCUDA\n\nSeveral variants of C/C++ and Fortran CUDA examples are available here that include MPI and multi-gpu examples.\n\nOne can use the Cray compiler wrappers to compile GPU-enabled applications as well.

            "OpenMP\n\nOverview\n\nThe OpenMP API is an open standard for parallel programming. The specification document can be found here: https://www.openmp.org. The specification describes directives, runtime routines, and environment variables that allow an application developer to express parallelism (e.g. shared memory multiprocessing and device offloading). Many compiler vendors provide implementations of the OpenMP specification (https://www.openmp.org/specifications).\n\nSetting the environment to use OpenMP on Polaris\n\nMany of the programming environments available on Polaris have OpenMP support.\n\nmodule OpenMP CPU support? OpenMP GPU support? PrgEnv-nvhpc yes yes llvm yes yes PrgEnv-gnu yes no PrgEnv-cray yes yes*\n\nCurrently PrgEnv-cray is not recommended for OpenMP offload.\n\nBy default, the PrgEnv-nvhpc module is loaded. To switch to other modules, you can use module switch.\n\nUsing PrgEnv-nvhpc\n\nThis is loaded by default, so there's no need to load additional modules. You can confirm that it is loaded by running module list to check that PrgEnv-nvhpc is in the list.\n\nUsing LLVM\n\nTo use the LLVM module, load the following.\nmodule load mpiwrappers/cray-mpich-llvm\nmodule load cudatoolkit-standalone\n\nSee the the LLVM compiling page here for more information.\n\nUsing PrgEnv-gnu\n\nTo switch from PrgEnv-nvhpc to PrgEnv-gnu you can run:\n\nmodule switch PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-gnu\n\nThe gcc/gfortran on Polaris was not built with GPU support. To use OpenMP on the CPU, you need to unload craype-accel-nvidia80:\n\nmodule unload craype-accel-nvidia80\n\nUsing PrgEnv-cray\n\nTo switch from PrgEnv-nvhpc to PrgEnv-cray you can run:\n\nmodule switch PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-cray\n\nTo use OpenMP on the CPU only, also unload craype-accel-nvidia80:\n\nmodule unload craype-accel-nvidia80\n\nTo use OpenMP on the GPU, load cudatoolkit-standalone, although this is not recommended at the moment.\nmodule load cudatoolkit-standalone\n\nBuilding on Polaris"

Users are encouraged to email support@alcf.anl.gov to report issues.\n\nSubmitting Jobs\n\nFor batch job submissions, if the parameters within your submission script do not meet the parameters of any of the execution queues (small, ..., backfill-large) you might not receive the \"Job submission\" error on the command line at all, and the job will never appear in history qstat -xu <username> (current bug in PBS). E.g. if a user submits a script to the prod routing queue requesting 10 nodes for 24 hours, exceeding \"Time Max\" of 6 hrs of the small execution queue (which handles jobs with 10-24 nodes), then it may behave as if the job was never submitted.\n\nJob scripts are copied to temporary locations after qsub and any changes to the original script while the job is queued will not be reflected in the copied script. Furthermore, qalter requires -A <allocation name> when changing job properties. Currently, there is a request for a qalter-like command to trigger a re-copy of the original script to the temporary location.\n\nCompiling & Running Applications\n\nIf your job fails to start with an RPC launch message like below, please forward the complete messages to support@alcf.anl.gov.\n\nbash\n   launch failed on x3104c0s1b0n0: Couldn't forward RPC launch(ab751d77-e80a-4c54-b1c2-4e881f7e8c90) to child x3104c0s31b0n0.hsn.cm.polaris.alcf.anl.gov: Resource temporarily unavailable",

            "JAX\n\nJAX is another popular python package for accelerated computing.  JAX is built on XLA (the same XLA TensorFlow uses) as well as AutoGrad, and additionally has acceleration tools that operate on functions such as vmap, jit, etc.  JAX is not as widespread in machine learning as TensorFlow and PyTorch for traditional models (Computer Vision, Language Models) though it is quickly gaining promienence.  JAX is very powerful when a program needs non-traditional autodifferentiation or vectorizatoin, such as: forward-mode AD, higher order derivatives, Jacobians, Hessians, or any combination of the above.  Users of JAX on Polaris are encouraged to read the user documentation in detail, particularly the details about pure-functional programming, no in-place operations, and the common mistakes in writing functions for the @jit decorator.\n\nJAX on Polaris\n\nJAX is installed on Polaris via the conda module, available with:\nbash\nmodule load conda; conda activate\n\nThen, you can load JAX in python as usual (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):\n\n```python\n\nimport jax\njax.version\n'0.3.15'\n\n```\n\nNotes on JAX 0.3.15\n\nOn Polaris, due to a bug, an environment variable must be set to use JAX on GPUs.  The following code will crash:\npython\nimport jax.numpy as numpy\na = numpy.zeros(1000)\noutputting an error that looks like:\npython\njaxlib.xla_extension.XlaRuntimeError: UNKNOWN: no kernel image is available for execution on the device\n\nYou can fix this by setting an environment variable:\nbash\nexport XLA_FLAGS=\"--xla_gpu_force_compilation_parallelism=1\"\n\nScaling JAX to multiple GPUs and multiple Nodes\n\nJax has intrinsic scaling tools to use multiple GPUs on a single node, via the pmap function.  If this is sufficient for your needs, excellent.  If not, another alternative is to use the newer package mpi4jax.",

            "Compilers provided by Cray Programming Environments\n\nThe default programming environment on Polaris is currently NVHPC. The GNU compilers are available via another programming environment. The following sequence of module commands can be used to switch to the GNU programming environment (gcc, g++, gfortran) and also have NVIDIA compilers available in your path.\n\nmodule swap PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-gnu\nmodule load nvhpc-mixed\n\nThe compilers invoked by the Cray MPI wrappers are listed for each programming environment in the following table.\n\nmodule C C++ Fortran MPI Compiler Wrapper cc CC ftn PrgEnv-nvhpc nvc nvc++ nvfortran PrgEnv-gnu gcc g++ gfortran\n\nNote, while gcc and g++ may be available in the default environment, the PrgEnv-gnu module is needed to provide gfortran.\n\nAdditional Compilers Provided by ALCF\n\nThe ALCF additionally provides compilers to enable the OpenMP and SYCL programming models for GPUs viaLLVM as documented here\n\nAdditional documentation for using compilers is available on the respective programming model pages: OpenMP and SYCL.\n\nLinking\n\nDynamic linking of libraries is currently the default on Polaris. The Cray MPI wrappers will handle this automatically.\n\nNotes on Default Modules\n\ncraype-x86-rome: While the Polaris compute nodes currently have Milan CPUs, this module is loaded by default to avoid the craype-x86-milan module from adding a zen3 target not supported in the default nvhpc/21.9 compilers. The craype-x86-milan module is expected to be made default once a newer nvhpc version (e.g. 22.5) is made the default.\n\ncraype-accel-nvidia80: This module adds compiler flags to enable GPU acceleration for NVHPC compilers along with gpu-enabled MPI libraries as it is assumed that the majority of applications to be compiled on Polaris will target the GPUs for acceleration. Users building cpu-only applications may find it useful to unload this module to silence \"gpu code generation\" warnings.\n\nMixed C/C++ & Fortran Applications",
            "JAX\n\nJAX is another popular python package for accelerated computing.  JAX is built on XLA (the same XLA TensorFlow uses) as well as AutoGrad, and additionally has acceleration tools that operate on functions such as vmap, jit, etc.  JAX is not as widespread in machine learning as TensorFlow and PyTorch for traditional models (Computer Vision, Language Models) though it is quickly gaining promienence.  JAX is very powerful when a program needs non-traditional autodifferentiation or vectorizatoin, such as: forward-mode AD, higher order derivatives, Jacobians, Hessians, or any combination of the above.  Users of JAX on Polaris are encouraged to read the user documentation in detail, particularly the details about pure-functional programming, no in-place operations, and the common mistakes in writing functions for the @jit decorator.\n\nJAX on Polaris\n\nJAX is installed on Polaris via the conda module, available with:\nbash\nmodule load conda; conda activate\n\nThen, you can load JAX in python as usual (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):\n\n```python\n\nimport jax\njax.version\n'0.3.15'\n\n```\n\nNotes on JAX 0.3.15\n\nOn Polaris, due to a bug, an environment variable must be set to use JAX on GPUs.  The following code will crash:\npython\nimport jax.numpy as numpy\na = numpy.zeros(1000)\noutputting an error that looks like:\npython\njaxlib.xla_extension.XlaRuntimeError: UNKNOWN: no kernel image is available for execution on the device\n\nYou can fix this by setting an environment variable:\nbash\nexport XLA_FLAGS=\"--xla_gpu_force_compilation_parallelism=1\"\n\nScaling JAX to multiple GPUs and multiple Nodes\n\nJax has intrinsic scaling tools to use multiple GPUs on a single node, via the pmap function.  If this is sufficient for your needs, excellent.  If not, another alternative is to use the newer package mpi4jax.",
            "Building on Polaris\n\nThe following table shows what compiler and flags to use with which PrgEnv:\n\nmodule compiler flags PrgEnv-nvhpc cc/CC/ftn (nvc/nvc++/nvfortran) -mp=gpu -gpu=cc80 llvm mpicc/mpicxx (clang/clang++) -fopenmp -fopenmp-targets=nvptx64-nvidia-cuda PrgEnv-gnu cc/CC/ftn (gcc/g++/gfortran) -fopenmp PrgEnv-cray cc/CC/ftn -fopenmp\n\nFor example to compile a simple code hello.cpp:\n\nFor PrgEnv-nvhpc, after loading the modules as discussed above we would use:\n\nCC -mp=gpu -gpu=cc80 hello.cpp\nftn -mp=gpu -gpu=cc80 hello.F90\n\nFor LLVM, after loading the modules as discussed above:\n\nmpicxx -fopenmp -fopenmp-targets=nvptx64-nvidia-cuda hello.cpp\n\nFor PrgEnv-gnu, after loading the modules as discussed above we would use:\n\nCC -fopenmp hello.cpp\nftn -fopenmp hello.F90\n\nFor PrgEnv-cray, after loading the modules as discussed above we would use:\n\nCC -fopenmp hello.cpp\nftn -fopenmp hello.F90\n\nRunning on Polaris\n\nTo run, you can run the produced executable or with mpiexec in a job script, and then submit the script to the Polaris queue, like:\n\n```\n$ cat submit.sh\n\n!/bin/sh\n\nPBS -l select=1:system=polaris\n\nPBS -l walltime=0:30:00\n\nPBS -q debug\n\nPBS -A Catalyst\n\nPBS -l filesystems=home:eagle\n\ncd ${PBS_O_WORKDIR}\n mpiexec -n 1 ./executable\n$ # submit to the queue:\n$ qsub -l select=1:system=polaris -l walltime=0:30:00 -l filesystems=home:eagle -q debug -A Catalyst ./submit.sh\n```\n\nIn the above, having the PBS options in the script and on the command line is redundant, but we put it there to show both ways of launching. This submits the script to one node in the debug queue on Polaris, requesting 30 min and the eagle and home filesystems. It will charge project Catalyst for the time.\n\nMore details for setting up the job script are in Job Scheduling and Execution section.\n\nExample\n\n```\n$ cat hello.cpp\n\ninclude\n\ninclude\n\nint main( int argv, char** argc ) {\n\nprintf( \"Number of devices: %d\\n\", omp_get_num_devices() );",

            "Containers on Polaris\n\nPolaris, powered by NVIDIA A100 GPUs, benefits from container-based workloads for seamless compatibility across NVIDIA systems. This guide details the use of containers on Polaris, including custom container creation, large-scale execution, and common pitfalls.\n\nApptainer Setup\n\nPolaris employs Apptainer (formerly known as Singularity) for container management. To set up Apptainer, run:\n\nbash\nmodule use /soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/install/modulefiles/Core\nmodule load apptainer\napptainer version #1.2.2\n\nThe Apptainer version on Polaris is 1.2.2. Detailed user documentation is available here\n\nBuilding from Docker or Argonne GitHub Container Registry\n\nContainers on Polaris can be built by writing Dockerfiles on a local machine and then publish the container to DockerHub, or by directly building them on ALCF compute node by writing an Apptainer recipe file. If you prefer to use existing containers, you can pull them from various registries like DockerHub and run them on Polaris.\n\nSince Docker requires root privileges, which users do not have on Polaris, existing Docker containers must be converted to Apptainer. To build a Docker-based container on Polaris, use the following as an example:",
            "```\n\nSpecial notes for Polaris\n\nOn Polaris, there is a known bug where python applications launched with mpi and that use fork to spawn processes can sometimes have unexplaned hangs.  For this reason, it is recommended to use start_method=\"spawn\" on Polaris when using the MpiExecLauncher as is shown in the example config above.  Alternatively, another solution is to use the GNUParallelLauncher which uses GNU Parallel to spawn processes.  GNU Parallel can be loaded in your environment with the command module load gnu-parallel.  Both of these approaches will circumvent the hang issue from using fork.\n\nUpdates\n\nFor parsl versions after July 2023, the address passed in the HighThroughputExecutor needs to be set to address = address_by_interface(\"bond0\").  With parsl versions prior to July 2023, it was recommended to use address = address_by_hostname() on Polaris, but with later versions this will not work on Polaris (or any other machine).",

            "ParaView on Polaris\n\nThe recommended way of running ParaView on Polaris is in client/server mode. This consists of running the ParaView client on your local resource, and the ParaView server on the Polaris compute nodes. The ParaView client needs to first be installed on your local resource, and needs to match the version that you run on Polaris.\n\nThere are multiple versions of ParaView installed on Polaris. To find the versions of ParaView currently available on Polaris run the following command on a login node: \nmodule use /soft/modulefiles\nmodule avail paraview\n\nBinary and source packages of the ParaView client for Linux, MacOS, and Windows are available from the ParaView Download Page.\n\nConnecting to the ParaView server on Polaris\n\nThis section describes how to launch the ParaView server on Polaris from a local ParaView client.\n\nStart ParaView Client\n\nFirst, launch the ParaView client on your local resource. You will need to configure some server settings in the client. This initial set up should only need to be done once, and can be reused each time you want to run ParaView on Polaris.\n\nServer Configuration\n\n1. Select Connect\n\nFrom the ParaView client choose to connect to a server by either clicking on the \"Connect\" icon in the menu bar\n\nor selecting File->Connect from the main menu\n\n2. Set Up Servers (first time only)\n\nThe first time you want to run a server on Polaris and have it connect to your local ParaView client, you will need to set up a Server. Once this server is set up, you can reuse it each time you run the ParaView client with the ParaView server on Polaris.\n\nKitware, the developers of ParaView, maintain a database of server configurations which you can retrieve through the ParaView client. In the File->Connect menu press the button named \"Fetch Servers\" and select POLARIS@ANL. Windows users should select \"windows to POLARIS@ANL\". Press \"Import Selected\"\n\n3. Use ParaView",
            "Controlling Where Your Job Runs\n\nIf you wish to have your job run on specific nodes form your select like this: -l select=1:vnode=<node name1>+1:vnode=<node name2>... . Obviously, that gets tedious for large jobs.\n\nIf you want to control the location of a few nodes, for example 2 out of 64, but the rest don't matter, you can do something like this: -l select=1:vnode=<node name1>+1:vnode=<node name2>+62:system=foo\n\nEvery node has a PBS resource called tier0 with a rack identifier and tier1 with a dragonfly group identifieer.  If you want all your nodes grouped in a rack, you can add the group specifier -l select=8:system=foo,place=scatter:group=tier0.  If you wanted everything in the same dragonfly group, replace tier0 with tier1.  Note that you have to also explicitly specify the place when you use group.  If you wanted a specific rack or dragonfly group instead of any of them, you are back to the select: -l select 10:tier0=x3001-g0.\n\nNetwork: Rack and Dragonfly Group Mappings\n\nRacks contain (7) 6U chassis; each chassis has 2 nodes for 14 nodes per rack\n\nThe hostnames are of the form xRRPPc0sUUb[0|1]n0 where:\nRR is the row {30, 31, 32}\nPP is the position in the row {30 goes 1-16, 31 and 32 go 1-12}\nc is chassis and is always 0\ns stands for slot, but in this case is the RU in the rack and values are {1,7,13,19,25,31,37}\nb is BMC controller and is 0 or 1 (each node has its own BMC)\nn is node, but is always 0 since there is only one node per BMC\n\nSo, 16+12+12 = 40 racks * 14 nodes per rack = 560 nodes.\n\nNote that in production group 9 (the last 4 racks) will be the designated on-demand racks\n\nThe management racks are x3000 and X3100 and are dragonfly group 10\n\nThe TDS rack is x3200 and is dragonfly group 11"

        "question": "Why am I seeing error messages indicating abnormal process termination for my processes run on logins?",
        "cot_answer": "Here's my step-by-step reasoning to answer the question:\n\nTo understand why you're seeing error messages indicating abnormal process termination for your processes run on logins, let's break down the context. The ParaView module has been updated, and the Visit module is in the process of being updated. This might not directly relate to the error messages, but it sets the stage for potential changes that could affect resource usage.\n\nThe key point is that memory limits were lowered on the logins due to resource contention to 8GB of memory, and 8 cores per user. This means that each user is now allocated a limited amount of resources, which can lead to error messages indicating abnormal process termination if these limits are exceeded.\n\nThe context provides examples of such error messages: `nvcc error: 'cudafe++' died due to signal 9 (Kill signal)` and `g++-12: fatal error: Killed signal terminated program cc1plus`. These errors are likely caused by exhausting the per-user resources on a login node, as each user is now allocated only 8 cores and 8GB memory.\n\nTo avoid these errors, you can either reduce the parallelism of your compile by using flags like `-j` or `-j4`, which would allow your process to use fewer resources. Alternatively, you can request a debug node and run your compile there, where you'll have access to the full resources of the node.\n\nBased on this reasoning, my final answer is:\n\n<ANSWER>: The error messages are likely due to exhausting the per-user resources on a login node, which were lowered to 8GB memory and 8 cores per user. To avoid these errors, you can reduce parallelism or request a debug node with more resources.",

            "Use TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.  Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.  When possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention.\n\nUse XLA compilation on your code.  XLA is the Accelerated Linear Algebra library that is available in tensorFlow and critical in software like JAX.  XLA will compile a tf.Graph object, generated with tf.function or similar, and perform optimizations like operation-fusion.  XLA can give impressive performance boosts with almost no user changes except to set an environment variable TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2.  If your code is complex, or has dynamically sized tensors (tensors where the shape changes every iteration), XLA can be detrimental: the overhead for compiling functions can be large enough to mitigate performance improvements.  XLA is particularly powerful when combined with reduced precision, yielding speedups > 100% in some models.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nTensorFlow is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with tensorFlow has been seen with horovod in particular.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation.  Some polaris specific details that may be helpful to you:\n\nCPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.  In particular, we encourage users to try their scaling measurements with the following settings:\n\nSet the environment variable NCCL_COLLNET_ENABLE=1",

                "Compiling and Linking Overview on Polaris\n\nCompiling on Polaris Login and Compute Nodes\n\nIf your build system does not require GPUs for the build process, as is usually the case, compilation of GPU-accelerated codes is generally expected to work well on the Polaris login nodes. If your build system does require GPUs, you cannot yet compile on the Polaris login nodes, as they do not currently have GPUs installed. You may in this case compile your applications on the Polaris compute nodes. Do this by submitting an interactive single-node job, or running your build system in a batch job.\n\nHome File System\n\nIs it helpful to realize that there is a single HOME filesystem for users that can be accessed from the login and computes of each production resource at ALCF. Thus, users should be mindful of modifications to their environments (e.g. .bashrc) that may cause issues to arise due to differences between the systems.\n\nCray Programming Environment\n\nThe Cray Programming Environment (PE) uses three compiler wrappers for building software. These compiler wrappers should be used when building MPI-enabled applications.\n\ncc - C compiler\n\nCC - C++ compiler\n\nftn - Fortran compiler\n\nEach of these wrappers can select a specific vendor compiler based on the PrgEnv module loaded in the environment. The following are some helpful options to understand what the compiler wrapper is invoking.\n\n--craype-verbose : Print the command which is forwarded to the compiler invocation\n\n--cray-print-opts=libs : Print library information\n\n--cray-print-opts=cflags : Print include information\n\nThe output from these commands may be useful in build scripts where a compiler other than that invoked by a compiler wrapper is desired. Defining some variables as such may prove useful in those situations.\nCRAY_CFLAGS=$(cc --cray-print-opts=cflags)\nCRAY_LIB=$(cc --cray-print-opts=libs)\nFurther documentation and options are available via man cc and similar.\n\nCompilers provided by Cray Programming Environments",

The gpu variable is calculated as (${num_gpus} - 1 - ${PMI_LOCAL_RANK} % ${num_gpus}), which means that each MPI rank gets a unique GPU assigned to it.\n3.

Therefore, this Julia depot folder should be located on a\nfast filesystem of your choice (grand, eagle). The Julia depot directory is\nset via the environment variable JULIA_DEPOT_PATH. For example, you can set\nthe Julia depot to a directory on Polaris grand filesystem by adding the following line\nto your ~/.bashrc file:\n\nbash\nexport JULIA_DEPOT_PATH=/grand/$PROJECT/$USER/julia_depot\n\nProgramming Julia on Polaris\n\nThere are three key components to using Julia for large-scale computations:\n\nMPI support through MPI.jl\n\nGPU support through CUDA.jl\n\nHDF5 support through HDF5.jl\n\nIn addition, we recommend VSCode with the Julia\nextension for a modern IDE experience, together\nwith the ssh-remote extension for remote interactive development.\n\nMPI Support\n\nMPI support is provided through the MPI.jl.\nbash\n$ julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(\"MPI\")'\nThis will install the MPI.jl package and default MPI prebuilt binaries provided by an artifact. For on-node debugging purposes the default artifact is sufficient. However, for large-scale computations, it is important to use the Cray MPICH installed on Polaris. As of MPI.jl v0.20 this is handled through MPIPrefences.jl.\n$ julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(\"MPIPreferences\")'\n$ julia --project -e 'using MPIPreferences; MPIPreferences.use_system_binary(vendor=\"cray\")'\n\nThe vendor=\"cray\" option is important if you intend to use gpu-aware MPI in your applications.\n\nCheck that the correct MPI library is targeted with Julia.\n```\njulia --project -e 'using MPI; MPI.versioninfo()'\nMPIPreferences:\n  binary:  system\n  abi:     MPICH\n  libmpi:  libmpi_nvidia.so\n  mpiexec: mpiexec",
            "Containers on Polaris\n\nPolaris, powered by NVIDIA A100 GPUs, benefits from container-based workloads for seamless compatibility across NVIDIA systems. This guide details the use of containers on Polaris, including custom container creation, large-scale execution, and common pitfalls.\n\nApptainer Setup\n\nPolaris employs Apptainer (formerly known as Singularity) for container management. To set up Apptainer, run:\n\nbash\nmodule use /soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/install/modulefiles/Core\nmodule load apptainer\napptainer version #1.2.2\n\nThe Apptainer version on Polaris is 1.2.2. Detailed user documentation is available here\n\nBuilding from Docker or Argonne GitHub Container Registry\n\nContainers on Polaris can be built by writing Dockerfiles on a local machine and then publish the container to DockerHub, or by directly building them on ALCF compute node by writing an Apptainer recipe file. If you prefer to use existing containers, you can pull them from various registries like DockerHub and run them on Polaris.\n\nSince Docker requires root privileges, which users do not have on Polaris, existing Docker containers must be converted to Apptainer. To build a Docker-based container on Polaris, use the following as an example:",

        "question": "How can you specify which nodes a job runs on?",
        "cot_answer": "To specify which nodes a job runs on, we can use the PBS resource specification option `-l`. There are several ways to do this, depending on our specific requirements.\n\nIf we want to run our job on specific nodes, but don't care about the rest, we can list them out individually using the `select` specifier. For example: `-l select=1:vnode=<node name1>+1:vnode=<node name2>+62:system=foo`. However, this can be tedious for large jobs.\n\nIf we want to control the location of a few nodes, but don't care about the rest, we can use the `select` specifier with the `group` option. For example: `-l select=8:system=foo,place=scatter:group=tier0`. This will group our nodes in a rack.\n\nIf we want to run our job on specific racks or dragonfly groups instead of individual nodes, we can use the `select` specifier with the `tier0` or `tier1` option. For example: `-l select 10:tier0=x3001-g0`.\n\nTo specify which nodes a job runs on, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Determine our specific requirements for node selection.\n2. Use the `select` specifier to list out individual nodes if desired.\n3. Use the `group` option with the `place` and `system` options to group nodes in a rack or dragonfly group.\n4.

Developers can optimize bottlenecks to scale efficiently across any number or size of CPUs and GPUs on Polaris. For further optimizations to compute kernels developers should use Nsight Compute.\n\nThe NVIDIA Nsight Compute is an interactive kernel profiler for CUDA applications. It provides detailed performance metrics and API debugging via a user interface and command line tool.\n\nIn addition, the baseline feature of this tool allows users to compare results within the tool.

Spack is an HPC-oriented\npackage manager which ALCF uses to install software for the user environment.\nHowever, no knowledge of Spack is necessary to use these software offerings. All\nALCF-managed software is accessible to users via modules.\n\nThe base suite of software tools and libraries can be accessed by loading the\nspack-pe-base module. This adds a path to $MODULEPATH which contains\nnumerous modules.\n\nFor example, to load cmake starting from the default environment, a user\nshould run the following commands:\nmodule use /soft/modulefiles\nmodule load spack-pe-base\nmodule load cmake\nOther modules in spack-pe-base can be browsed by running module avail or\nmodule --show-hidden avail. The latter shows hidden modules which are\ninstalled as dependencies of the un-hidden modules.\n\nIn addition to the base stack, a suite of higher-level libraries are installed\nin the spack-pe-gnu module. These are built with and are dependent on\nPrgEnv-gnu. A PrgEnv-nvidia-compatible stack will be available in the\nfuture.\n\nNote that not all software is installed through Spack; many applications and\nlibraries are installed as standalone packages in /soft.

E.g. if a user submits a script to the prod routing queue requesting 10 nodes for 24 hours, exceeding \"Time Max\" of 6 hrs of the small execution queue (which handles jobs with 10-24 nodes), then it may behave as if the job was never submitted.\n\nJob scripts are copied to temporary locations after qsub and any changes to the original script while the job is queued will not be reflected in the copied script. Furthermore, qalter requires -A <allocation name> when changing job properties. Currently, there is a request for a qalter-like command to trigger a re-copy of the original script to the temporary location.\n\nCompiling & Running Applications\n\nIf your job fails to start with an RPC launch message like below, please forward the complete messages to support@alcf.anl.gov.\n\nbash\n   launch failed on x3104c0s1b0n0: Couldn't forward RPC launch(ab751d77-e80a-4c54-b1c2-4e881f7e8c90) to child x3104c0s31b0n0.hsn.cm.polaris.alcf.anl.gov: Resource temporarily unavailable",

            "```\n\nSpecial notes for Polaris\n\nOn Polaris, there is a known bug where python applications launched with mpi and that use fork to spawn processes can sometimes have unexplaned hangs.  For this reason, it is recommended to use start_method=\"spawn\" on Polaris when using the MpiExecLauncher as is shown in the example config above.  Alternatively, another solution is to use the GNUParallelLauncher which uses GNU Parallel to spawn processes.  GNU Parallel can be loaded in your environment with the command module load gnu-parallel.  Both of these approaches will circumvent the hang issue from using fork.\n\nUpdates\n\nFor parsl versions after July 2023, the address passed in the HighThroughputExecutor needs to be set to address = address_by_interface(\"bond0\").  With parsl versions prior to July 2023, it was recommended to use address = address_by_hostname() on Polaris, but with later versions this will not work on Polaris (or any other machine).",

            "Containers on Polaris\n\nPolaris, powered by NVIDIA A100 GPUs, benefits from container-based workloads for seamless compatibility across NVIDIA systems. This guide details the use of containers on Polaris, including custom container creation, large-scale execution, and common pitfalls.\n\nApptainer Setup\n\nPolaris employs Apptainer (formerly known as Singularity) for container management. To set up Apptainer, run:\n\nbash\nmodule use /soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/install/modulefiles/Core\nmodule load apptainer\napptainer version #1.2.2\n\nThe Apptainer version on Polaris is 1.2.2. Detailed user documentation is available here\n\nBuilding from Docker or Argonne GitHub Container Registry\n\nContainers on Polaris can be built by writing Dockerfiles on a local machine and then publish the container to DockerHub, or by directly building them on ALCF compute node by writing an Apptainer recipe file. If you prefer to use existing containers, you can pull them from various registries like DockerHub and run them on Polaris.\n\nSince Docker requires root privileges, which users do not have on Polaris, existing Docker containers must be converted to Apptainer. To build a Docker-based container on Polaris, use the following as an example:",

            "Use TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.  Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.  When possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention.\n\nUse XLA compilation on your code.  XLA is the Accelerated Linear Algebra library that is available in tensorFlow and critical in software like JAX.  XLA will compile a tf.Graph object, generated with tf.function or similar, and perform optimizations like operation-fusion.  XLA can give impressive performance boosts with almost no user changes except to set an environment variable TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2.  If your code is complex, or has dynamically sized tensors (tensors where the shape changes every iteration), XLA can be detrimental: the overhead for compiling functions can be large enough to mitigate performance improvements.  XLA is particularly powerful when combined with reduced precision, yielding speedups > 100% in some models.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nTensorFlow is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with tensorFlow has been seen with horovod in particular.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation.  Some polaris specific details that may be helpful to you:\n\nCPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.

If you wanted a specific rack or dragonfly group instead of any of them, you are back to the select: -l select 10:tier0=x3001-g0.\n\nNetwork: Rack and Dragonfly Group Mappings\n\nRacks contain (7) 6U chassis; each chassis has 2 nodes for 14 nodes per rack\n\nThe hostnames are of the form xRRPPc0sUUb[0|1]n0 where:\nRR is the row {30, 31, 32}\nPP is the position in the row {30 goes 1-16, 31 and 32 go 1-12}\nc is chassis and is always 0\ns stands for slot, but in this case is the RU in the rack and values are {1,7,13,19,25,31,37}\nb is BMC controller and is 0 or 1 (each node has its own BMC)\nn is node, but is always 0 since there is only one node per BMC\n\nSo, 16+12+12 = 40 racks * 14 nodes per rack = 560 nodes.\n\nNote that in production group 9 (the last 4 racks) will be the designated on-demand racks\n\nThe management racks are x3000 and X3100 and are dragonfly group 10\n\nThe TDS rack is x3200 and is dragonfly group 11",

            "```\n\nSpecial notes for Polaris\n\nOn Polaris, there is a known bug where python applications launched with mpi and that use fork to spawn processes can sometimes have unexplaned hangs.  For this reason, it is recommended to use start_method=\"spawn\" on Polaris when using the MpiExecLauncher as is shown in the example config above.  Alternatively, another solution is to use the GNUParallelLauncher which uses GNU Parallel to spawn processes.  GNU Parallel can be loaded in your environment with the command module load gnu-parallel.  Both of these approaches will circumvent the hang issue from using fork.\n\nUpdates\n\nFor parsl versions after July 2023, the address passed in the HighThroughputExecutor needs to be set to address = address_by_interface(\"bond0\").  With parsl versions prior to July 2023, it was recommended to use address = address_by_hostname() on Polaris, but with later versions this will not work on Polaris (or any other machine).",
            "Result is CORRECT!! :)\n``\nIf the application instead relies on the job launcher to bind MPI ranks to available GPUs, then a small helper script can be used to explicitly setCUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` appropriately for each MPI rank. One example is available here where each MPI rank is similarly bound to a single GPU with round-robin assignment. The binding of MPI ranks to GPUs is discussed in more detail here.\n\nGPU OpenCL\n\nA simple OpenCL example is available here. The OpenCL headers and library are available in the NVHPC SDK and cuda toolkits. The environment variable NVIDIA_PATH is defined for the PrgEnv-nvhpc programming environment. \nCC -o vecadd -g -O3 -std=c++0x  -I${NVIDIA_PATH}/cuda/include main.o -L${NVIDIA_PATH}/cuda/lib64 -lOpenCL\n\nThis simple example can be run on a Polaris compute node as follows.\n```\n$ ./vecadd\nRunning on GPU!\nUsing single-precision\n\nResult is CORRECT!! :)\n```\n\nGPU OpenMP\n\nA simple MPI-parallel OpenMP example is available here.

Set Up Servers (first time only)\n\nThe first time you want to run a server on Polaris and have it connect to your local ParaView client, you will need to set up a Server. Once this server is set up, you can reuse it each time you run the ParaView client with the ParaView server on Polaris.\n\nKitware, the developers of ParaView, maintain a database of server configurations which you can retrieve through the ParaView client.

Users are encouraged to email support@alcf.anl.gov to report issues.\n\nSubmitting Jobs\n\nFor batch job submissions, if the parameters within your submission script do not meet the parameters of any of the execution queues (small, ..., backfill-large) you might not receive the \"Job submission\" error on the command line at all, and the job will never appear in history qstat -xu <username> (current bug in PBS). E.g. if a user submits a script to the prod routing queue requesting 10 nodes for 24 hours, exceeding \"Time Max\" of 6 hrs of the small execution queue (which handles jobs with 10-24 nodes), then it may behave as if the job was never submitted.\n\nJob scripts are copied to temporary locations after qsub and any changes to the original script while the job is queued will not be reflected in the copied script. Furthermore, qalter requires -A <allocation name> when changing job properties. Currently, there is a request for a qalter-like command to trigger a re-copy of the original script to the temporary location.\n\nCompiling & Running Applications\n\nIf your job fails to start with an RPC launch message like below, please forward the complete messages to support@alcf.anl.gov.\n\nbash\n   launch failed on x3104c0s1b0n0: Couldn't forward RPC launch(ab751d77-e80a-4c54-b1c2-4e881f7e8c90) to child x3104c0s31b0n0.hsn.cm.polaris.alcf.anl.gov: Resource temporarily unavailable",

Identify the job launcher that you are using (e.g., Slurm, PBS).\n2. Use the job launcher's features to bind each MPI rank to a specific GPU. For example, if you're using Slurm, you can use the `--gres=gpu:1` option to request one GPU per node and then use the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable to set the visible devices for each MPI rank.\n3. Write a small helper script that sets the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable for each MPI rank based on its rank number. For example, you can use the following script:\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Get the current MPI rank\nrank=$OMPI_COMM_WORLD_RANK\n\n# Set the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=$((rank % 4))\n\n# Run your application\n./your_app\n```\nThis script sets the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable to the GPU corresponding to the current MPI rank, using a round-robin assignment.\n\n<ANSWER>: Use a small helper script that sets the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable for each MPI rank based on its rank number.",

            "Compiling and Linking Overview on Polaris\n\nCompiling on Polaris Login and Compute Nodes\n\nIf your build system does not require GPUs for the build process, as is usually the case, compilation of GPU-accelerated codes is generally expected to work well on the Polaris login nodes. If your build system does require GPUs, you cannot yet compile on the Polaris login nodes, as they do not currently have GPUs installed. You may in this case compile your applications on the Polaris compute nodes. Do this by submitting an interactive single-node job, or running your build system in a batch job.\n\nHome File System\n\nIs it helpful to realize that there is a single HOME filesystem for users that can be accessed from the login and computes of each production resource at ALCF. Thus, users should be mindful of modifications to their environments (e.g. .bashrc) that may cause issues to arise due to differences between the systems.\n\nCray Programming Environment\n\nThe Cray Programming Environment (PE) uses three compiler wrappers for building software. These compiler wrappers should be used when building MPI-enabled applications.\n\ncc - C compiler\n\nCC - C++ compiler\n\nftn - Fortran compiler\n\nEach of these wrappers can select a specific vendor compiler based on the PrgEnv module loaded in the environment.

For performance, it will likely be necessary to ensure that each application runs on a distinct set of CPU resources and/or targets specific GPUs. One can provide a list of CPUs using the --cpu-bind option, which when combined with CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES provides a user with specifying exactly which CPU and GPU resources to run each application on. In the example below, four instances of the application are simultaneously running on a single node. In the first instance, the application is spawning MPI ranks 0-7 on CPUs 24-31 and using GPU 0. This mapping is based on output from the nvidia-smi topo -m command and pairs CPUs with the closest GPU.\n\n```bash\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:24:25:26:27:28:29:30:31 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:16:17:18:19:20:21:22:23 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:8:9:10:11:12:13:14:15 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=3\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:0:1:2:3:4:5:6:7 ./hello_affinity &\n\nwait\n```\n\nCompute Node Access to the Internet\n\nCurrently, the only access the internet is via a proxy.

            "TensorFlow on Polaris\n\nTensorFlow is a popular, open-source deep learning framework developed and released by Google.  The TensorFlow home page has more information about TensorFlow, which you can refer to.  For trouble shooting on Polaris, please contact support@alcf.anl.gov.\n\nInstallation on Polaris\n\nTensorFlow is already pre-installed on Polaris, available in the conda module.  To use it from a compute node, please do:\n\nbash\nmodule load conda\nconda activate\n\nThen, you can load TensorFlow in python as usual (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):\n\n```python\n\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.version\n'2.9.1'\n\n```\n\nThis installation of TensorFlow was built from source and the CUDA libraries it uses are found via the CUDA_HOME environment variable (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):\n\nbash\n$ echo $CUDA_HOME\n/soft/datascience/cuda/cuda_11.5.2_495.29.05_linux\n\nIf you need to build applications that use this version of TensorFlow and CUDA, we recommend using these cuda libraries to ensure compatibility.  We periodically update the TensorFlow release, though updates will come in the form of new versions of the conda module.\n\nTensorFlow is also available through NVIDIA containers that have been translated to Singularity containers.  For more information about containers, please see the Containers documentation page.\n\nTensorFlow Best Practices on Polaris\n\nSingle Node Performance\n\nWhen running TensorFlow applications, we have found the following practices to be generally, if not universally, useful and encourage you to try some of these techniques to boost performance of your own applications.\n\nUse Reduced Precision. Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with TensorFlow operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the tf.keras.mixed_precision Policy, as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  If you use a custom training loop (and not keras.Model.fit), you will also need to apply loss scaling.",

If your build system does require GPUs, you cannot yet compile on the Polaris login nodes, as they do not currently have GPUs installed. You may in this case compile your applications on the Polaris compute nodes. Do this by submitting an interactive single-node job, or running your build system in a batch job.\n\nHome File System\n\nIs it helpful to realize that there is a single HOME filesystem for users that can be accessed from the login and computes of each production resource at ALCF. Thus, users should be mindful of modifications to their environments (e.g. .bashrc) that may cause issues to arise due to differences between the systems.\n\nCray Programming Environment\n\nThe Cray Programming Environment (PE) uses three compiler wrappers for building software. These compiler wrappers should be used when building MPI-enabled applications.\n\ncc - C compiler\n\nCC - C++ compiler\n\nftn - Fortran compiler\n\nEach of these wrappers can select a specific vendor compiler based on the PrgEnv module loaded in the environment. The following are some helpful options to understand what the compiler wrapper is invoking.\n\n--craype-verbose : Print the command which is forwarded to the compiler invocation\n\n--cray-print-opts=libs : Print library information\n\n--cray-print-opts=cflags : Print include information\n\nThe output from these commands may be useful in build scripts where a compiler other than that invoked by a compiler wrapper is desired. Defining some variables as such may prove useful in those situations.\nCRAY_CFLAGS=$(cc --cray-print-opts=cflags)\nCRAY_LIB=$(cc --cray-print-opts=libs)\nFurther documentation and options are available via man cc and similar.\n\nCompilers provided by Cray Programming Environments",

It is primarily designed for biochemical molecules like proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids that have a lot of complicated bonded interactions, but since GROMACS is extremely fast at calculating the nonbonded interactions (that usually dominate simulations) many groups are also using it for research on non-biological systems, e.g. polymers.\n\nUsing GROMACS at ALCF\n\nALCF offers assistance with building binaries and compiling instructions for GROMACS.

A Balsam Site runs on a node with access to the job scheduler, where it can submit and monitor jobs. Overall job state is aggregated on the Balsam Server, making job data from all Sites accessible from any individual site (or the user's laptop), via the command-line interface or the Python API. To get information on how to use the command line tool, you can type balsam --help in your shell.\n\nFull documentation for Balsam is available online.\n\nBalsam requires Python 3.7+. To install Balsam on Polaris, first set up a virtual Python environment:\n\nshell\nmodule load conda\nconda activate base\npython -m venv env\nsource env/bin/activate\npip install --upgrade pip\npip install --pre balsam\n\nTo use Balsam, users need an account on the Balsam server.  Users can get an account by contacting the ALCF Help Desk.  Once a user has an account, they can login and make a new site.  A Balsam site is a project space for your workflow. You will be prompted to select what machine (Polaris) you are working on when creating a new site:\n\nshell\nbalsam login\nbalsam site init -n new-site new-site\ncd new-site\nbalsam site start\n\nSee the Balsam documentation for full details.",

                "Use TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.  Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.  When possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention.\n\nUse XLA compilation on your code.  XLA is the Accelerated Linear Algebra library that is available in tensorFlow and critical in software like JAX.  XLA will compile a tf.Graph object, generated with tf.function or similar, and perform optimizations like operation-fusion.  XLA can give impressive performance boosts with almost no user changes except to set an environment variable TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2.  If your code is complex, or has dynamically sized tensors (tensors where the shape changes every iteration), XLA can be detrimental: the overhead for compiling functions can be large enough to mitigate performance improvements.  XLA is particularly powerful when combined with reduced precision, yielding speedups > 100% in some models.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nTensorFlow is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with tensorFlow has been seen with horovod in particular.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation.  Some polaris specific details that may be helpful to you:\n\nCPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.  In particular, we encourage users to try their scaling measurements with the following settings:\n\nSet the environment variable NCCL_COLLNET_ENABLE=1",

Variational Monte Carlo (VMC), diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) and a number of other advanced QMC algorithms are implemented. Orbital space auxiliary field QMC (AFQMC) has recently been added. By directly solving the Schrodinger equation, QMC methods offer greater accuracy than methods such as density functional theory, but at a trade-off of much greater computational expense.\n\nPrebuilt executables are provided at /soft/applications/qmcpack.\nThe directory of each installation also includes a job submission script example qmcpack-polaris.job.\nUpdate build recipe is provided on GitHub.",
            "Running Multiple MPI Applications on a node\n\nMultiple applications can be run simultaneously on a node by launching several mpiexec commands and backgrounding them. For performance, it will likely be necessary to ensure that each application runs on a distinct set of CPU resources and/or targets specific GPUs. One can provide a list of CPUs using the --cpu-bind option, which when combined with CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES provides a user with specifying exactly which CPU and GPU resources to run each application on. In the example below, four instances of the application are simultaneously running on a single node. In the first instance, the application is spawning MPI ranks 0-7 on CPUs 24-31 and using GPU 0. This mapping is based on output from the nvidia-smi topo -m command and pairs CPUs with the closest GPU.\n\n```bash\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:24:25:26:27:28:29:30:31 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:16:17:18:19:20:21:22:23 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:8:9:10:11:12:13:14:15 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=3\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:0:1:2:3:4:5:6:7 ./hello_affinity &\n\nwait\n```\n\nCompute Node Access to the Internet\n\nCurrently, the only access the internet is via a proxy.  Here are the proxy environment variables for Polaris:\n\nbash\nexport http_proxy=\"http://proxy.alcf.anl.gov:3128\"\nexport https_proxy=\"http://proxy.alcf.anl.gov:3128\"\nexport ftp_proxy=\"http://proxy.alcf.anl.gov:3128\"\n\nIn the future, though we don't have a timeline on this because it depends on future features in slingshot and internal software development, we intend to have public IP addresses be a schedulable resource.  For instance, if only your head node needed public access your select statement might looks something like: -l select=1:pubnet=True+63.\n\nControlling Where Your Job Runs"

The following sequence of module commands can be used to switch to the GNU programming environment (gcc, g++, gfortran) and also have NVIDIA compilers available in your path.\n\nmodule swap PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-gnu\nmodule load nvhpc-mixed\n\nThe compilers invoked by the Cray MPI wrappers are listed for each programming environment in the following table.\n\nmodule C C++ Fortran MPI Compiler Wrapper cc CC ftn PrgEnv-nvhpc nvc nvc++ nvfortran PrgEnv-gnu gcc g++ gfortran\n\nNote, while gcc and g++ may be available in the default environment, the PrgEnv-gnu module is needed to provide gfortran.\n\nAdditional Compilers Provided by ALCF\n\nThe ALCF additionally provides compilers to enable the OpenMP and SYCL programming models for GPUs viaLLVM as documented here\n\nAdditional documentation for using compilers is available on the respective programming model pages: OpenMP and SYCL.\n\nLinking\n\nDynamic linking of libraries is currently the default on Polaris. The Cray MPI wrappers will handle this automatically.\n\nNotes on Default Modules\n\ncraype-x86-rome: While the Polaris compute nodes currently have Milan CPUs, this module is loaded by default to avoid the craype-x86-milan module from adding a zen3 target not supported in the default nvhpc/21.9 compilers. The craype-x86-milan module is expected to be made default once a newer nvhpc version (e.g. 22.5) is made the default.\n\ncraype-accel-nvidia80: This module adds compiler flags to enable GPU acceleration for NVHPC compilers along with gpu-enabled MPI libraries as it is assumed that the majority of applications to be compiled on Polaris will target the GPUs for acceleration. Users building cpu-only applications may find it useful to unload this module to silence \"gpu code generation\" warnings.\n\nMixed C/C++ & Fortran Applications",

Many tools exist to address this, of which parsl is just one.  On this page, we'll highlight some of the key pieces of information about parsl that are relevant to Polaris.  Parsl is also extensively documented, has a dedicated Slack Channel, and a large community of users and developers beyond ALCF.  We encourage you to engage with the parsl community for support with parsl specific questions, and for Polaris-specific questions or problems, please contact support@alcf.anl.gov.\n\nGetting Parsl on Polaris\n\nYou can install parsl building off of the conda modules.  You have some flexibility in how you want to extend the conda module to include parsl, but here is an example way to do it:\n\n```python\n\nLoad the Conda Module (needed everytime you use parsl)\n\nmodule load conda\nconda activate\n\nCreate a virtual env that uses the conda env as the system packages.\n\nOnly do the next line on initial set up:\n\npython -m venv --system-site-packages /path/to/your/virtualenv\n\nLoad the virtual env (every time):\n\nsource /path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/activate\n\nInstall parsl (only once)\n\npip install parsl\n\n```\n\nUsing Parsl on Polaris\n\nParsl has a variety of possible configuration settings.  As an example, we provide the configuration below that will run one task per GPU:\n\n```python\nfrom parsl.config import Config\n\nPBSPro is the right provider for Polaris:\n\nfrom parsl.providers import PBSProProvider\n\nThe high throughput executor is for scaling to HPC systems:\n\nfrom parsl.executors import HighThroughputExecutor\n\nYou can use the MPI launcher, but may want the Gnu Parallel launcher, see below\n\nfrom parsl.launchers import MpiExecLauncher, GnuParallelLauncher\n\naddress_by_interface is needed for the HighThroughputExecutor:",

Keep in mind that client and servers versions must match. The ParaView version currently deployed on Polaris is 5.12.0\n\nConnecting to ParaView server\n\nConnect your ParaView client to the server configuration you created above. You can select Connect, either from the File menu, or the icon circled in the figure:\n\nand selecting the configuration you created in a previous step.\n\nThe connection should point to:\n\nlocalhost:8000\n\nIn the terminal where you launched the server you will see now that the connection is established.

By convention, Kokkos only allows one GPU backend at a time.\n\nKokkos Documentation\n\nKokkos-core Wiki\n\nKokkos github\n\nKokkos on Polaris\n\nFollowing the Polaris upgrade to HPCM\n1.10,\nthe module setup to use the prebuilt Kokkos changed.\n\nThe prebuilt Kokkos on polaris includes 3 backends: Serial and OpenMP for CPU\nexecution and CUDA for GPU execution. To use it, run\n\nmodule load craype-x86-milan\nmodule load craype-accel-nvidia80\nmodule swap PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-gnu\nmodule use /soft/modulefiles\nmodule load cuda-PrgEnv-nvidia/12.2.91\nmodule load kokkos\n\nThis sets the following environment variables, some of which are used by\ncmake:\n\nKOKKOS_HOME - path to the lib64/, include/ files installed\n\nLIBRARY_PATH - prepends $KOKKOS_HOME/lib64 to this variable used by cmake\n\nCPATH - prepends $KOKKOS_HOME/include to this variable used by cmake\n\nLD_LIBRARY_PATH - prepends $KOKKOS_HOME/lib64 to this variable\n\nBuilding a Kokkos Application Using cmake\n\nAdd these lines to CMakeLists.txt:\n\nfind_package(Kokkos REQUIRED)\ntarget_link_libraries(myTarget Kokkos::kokkoscore)\n\nHere is a simple example CMakeLists.txt to compile an example program:\n\n```\ncmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.22)\nproject(buildExample)\nfind_package(Kokkos REQUIRED)\n\nset(buildExample_SOURCE_DIR \".\")\n\nset(top_SRCS\n  ${buildExample_SOURCE_DIR}/example1.cpp)\n\nset(SOURCE_FILES ${top_SRCS})",
            "Example Programs and Makefiles for Polaris\n\nSeveral simple examples of building CPU and GPU-enabled codes on Polaris are available in the ALCF GettingStart repo for several programming models. If build your application is problematic for some reason (e.g. absence of a GPU), then users are encouraged to build and test applications directly on one of the Polaris compute nodes via an interactive job. The discussion below makes use of the NVHPC compilers in the default environment as illustrative examples. Similar examples for other compilers on Polaris are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo.\n\nCPU MPI+OpenMP Example\n\nOne of the first useful tasks with any new machine, scheduler, and job launcher is to ensure one is binding MPI ranks and OpenMP threads to the host cpu as intended. A simple HelloWorld MPI+OpenMP example is available here to get started with.\n\nThe application can be straightforwardly compiled using the Cray compiler wrappers.\nCC -fopenmp main.cpp -o hello_affinity\n\nThe executable hello_affinity can then be launched in a job script (or directly in shell of interactive job) using mpiexec as discussed here.\n\n```\n\n!/bin/sh\n\nPBS -l select=1:system=polaris\n\nPBS -l place=scatter\n\nPBS -l walltime=0:30:00\n\nPBS -l filesystems=home\n\nMPI example w/ 16 MPI ranks per node spread evenly across cores\n\nNNODES=wc -l < $PBS_NODEFILE\nNRANKS_PER_NODE=16\nNDEPTH=4\nNTHREADS=1\n\nNTOTRANKS=$(( NNODES * NRANKS_PER_NODE ))\necho \"NUM_OF_NODES= ${NNODES} TOTAL_NUM_RANKS= ${NTOTRANKS} RANKS_PER_NODE= ${NRANKS_PER_NODE} THREADS_PER_RANK= ${NTHREADS}\"\n\nmpiexec -n ${NTOTRANKS} --ppn ${NRANKS_PER_NODE} --depth=${NDEPTH} --cpu-bind depth ./hello_affinity\n```\n\nCUDA\n\nSeveral variants of C/C++ and Fortran CUDA examples are available here that include MPI and multi-gpu examples.\n\nOne can use the Cray compiler wrappers to compile GPU-enabled applications as well.

            "Use TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.  Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.  When possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention.\n\nUse XLA compilation on your code.  XLA is the Accelerated Linear Algebra library that is available in tensorFlow and critical in software like JAX.  XLA will compile a tf.Graph object, generated with tf.function or similar, and perform optimizations like operation-fusion.  XLA can give impressive performance boosts with almost no user changes except to set an environment variable TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2.  If your code is complex, or has dynamically sized tensors (tensors where the shape changes every iteration), XLA can be detrimental: the overhead for compiling functions can be large enough to mitigate performance improvements.  XLA is particularly powerful when combined with reduced precision, yielding speedups > 100% in some models.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nTensorFlow is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with tensorFlow has been seen with horovod in particular.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation.  Some polaris specific details that may be helpful to you:\n\nCPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.  In particular, we encourage users to try their scaling measurements with the following settings:\n\nSet the environment variable NCCL_COLLNET_ENABLE=1",

            "Use TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.  Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.  When possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention.\n\nUse XLA compilation on your code.  XLA is the Accelerated Linear Algebra library that is available in tensorFlow and critical in software like JAX.  XLA will compile a tf.Graph object, generated with tf.function or similar, and perform optimizations like operation-fusion.  XLA can give impressive performance boosts with almost no user changes except to set an environment variable TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2.  If your code is complex, or has dynamically sized tensors (tensors where the shape changes every iteration), XLA can be detrimental: the overhead for compiling functions can be large enough to mitigate performance improvements.  XLA is particularly powerful when combined with reduced precision, yielding speedups > 100% in some models.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nTensorFlow is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with tensorFlow has been seen with horovod in particular.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation.  Some polaris specific details that may be helpful to you:\n\nCPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.  In particular, we encourage users to try their scaling measurements with the following settings:\n\nSet the environment variable NCCL_COLLNET_ENABLE=1"

In general, the way to do this is via the PyTorch Automatic Mixed Precision package (AMP), as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.

The latter shows hidden modules which are\ninstalled as dependencies of the un-hidden modules.\n\nIn addition to the base stack, a suite of higher-level libraries are installed\nin the spack-pe-gnu module. These are built with and are dependent on\nPrgEnv-gnu.

Specifically, it's the `max_blocks` parameter that determines the maximum number of blocks that can be run in parallel.\n\nAccording to the context, `max_blocks=1`, which means only one block can be run at a time. However, this value can be increased to allow more parallel jobs.\n\nTo increase the maximum number of parallel blocks, I would set `max_blocks` to a higher value, such as 2 or 4, depending on the available resources and the specific use case.\n\n##begin_quote##\ninit_blocks=1,\nmin_blocks=0,\nmax_blocks=1, # Can increase more to have more parallel jobs\n##end_quote##\n\nBased on this analysis, I conclude that the maximum number of blocks that can be run in parallel is currently set to 1, but it can be increased by modifying the `max_blocks` parameter.\n\n<ANSWER>: The maximum number of blocks that can be run in parallel is currently 1, but it can be increased.",

            "OpenMP\n\nOverview\n\nThe OpenMP API is an open standard for parallel programming. The specification document can be found here: https://www.openmp.org. The specification describes directives, runtime routines, and environment variables that allow an application developer to express parallelism (e.g. shared memory multiprocessing and device offloading). Many compiler vendors provide implementations of the OpenMP specification (https://www.openmp.org/specifications).\n\nSetting the environment to use OpenMP on Polaris\n\nMany of the programming environments available on Polaris have OpenMP support.\n\nmodule OpenMP CPU support? OpenMP GPU support? PrgEnv-nvhpc yes yes llvm yes yes PrgEnv-gnu yes no PrgEnv-cray yes yes*\n\nCurrently PrgEnv-cray is not recommended for OpenMP offload.\n\nBy default, the PrgEnv-nvhpc module is loaded. To switch to other modules, you can use module switch.\n\nUsing PrgEnv-nvhpc\n\nThis is loaded by default, so there's no need to load additional modules. You can confirm that it is loaded by running module list to check that PrgEnv-nvhpc is in the list.\n\nUsing LLVM\n\nTo use the LLVM module, load the following.\nmodule load mpiwrappers/cray-mpich-llvm\nmodule load cudatoolkit-standalone\n\nSee the the LLVM compiling page here for more information.\n\nUsing PrgEnv-gnu\n\nTo switch from PrgEnv-nvhpc to PrgEnv-gnu you can run:\n\nmodule switch PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-gnu\n\nThe gcc/gfortran on Polaris was not built with GPU support. To use OpenMP on the CPU, you need to unload craype-accel-nvidia80:\n\nmodule unload craype-accel-nvidia80\n\nUsing PrgEnv-cray\n\nTo switch from PrgEnv-nvhpc to PrgEnv-cray you can run:\n\nmodule switch PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-cray\n\nTo use OpenMP on the CPU only, also unload craype-accel-nvidia80:\n\nmodule unload craype-accel-nvidia80\n\nTo use OpenMP on the GPU, load cudatoolkit-standalone, although this is not recommended at the moment.\nmodule load cudatoolkit-standalone\n\nBuilding on Polaris"

Use the GNUParallelLauncher, which uses GNU Parallel to spawn processes. This can be loaded in the environment with the command `module load gnu-parallel`.\n\n3. Analyze the context: The context suggests that the issue is specific to Polaris and is related to the use of fork to spawn processes.\n\n4. Draw a conclusion: Based on the analysis, it appears that the unexplained hangs are caused by the known bug on Polaris when using fork to spawn processes.\n\n5.

Designed at MIT to tackle large-scale\npartial-differential equation simulation and distributed linear algebra, Julia\nfeatures a robust ecosystem of tools for\noptimization,\nstatistics, parallel programming, and data\nvisualization. Julia is actively developed by the Julia\nLabs team at MIT and in\nindustry, along with hundreds of domain-expert\nscientists and programmers worldwide.\n\nContributing\n\nThis guide is a first draft of the Julia documentation for Polaris. If you have any\nsuggestions or contributions, please open a pull request or contact us by\nopening a ticket at the ALCF Helpdesk.\n\nJulia Installation\n\nWe encourage users interested in using Julia on Polaris to install in their home or project directories at this time. Using the official Julia 1.9 binaries from the Julia\nwebpage is recommended.\nJuliaup provides a convenient way to\ninstall Julia and manage the various Julia versions. The default installation will install julia, juliaup, and other commands in a ${HOME}/.julia directory and update profile files like .bashrc to update PATH to include that directory. One can customize the installation to change these defaults.\n\nbash\nmodule load craype-accel-nvidia80\ncurl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh\n\nIf you chose a custom installation, then be sure to update the PATH environment variable appropriately.\n\nexport PATH=${HOME}/.juliaup/bin:${PATH}\n\nYou may then list the available Julia versions with juliaup list and install a\nspecific version with juliaup install <version>. You can then activate a\nspecific version with juliaup use <version> and set the default version with\njuliaup default <version>. juliaup update will update the installed Julia\nversions. In general, the latest stable release of Julia should be used.\n\nbash\njuliaup add release\n\nJulia Project Environment",

            "TensorFlow on Polaris\n\nTensorFlow is a popular, open-source deep learning framework developed and released by Google.  The TensorFlow home page has more information about TensorFlow, which you can refer to.  For trouble shooting on Polaris, please contact support@alcf.anl.gov.\n\nInstallation on Polaris\n\nTensorFlow is already pre-installed on Polaris, available in the conda module.  To use it from a compute node, please do:\n\nbash\nmodule load conda\nconda activate\n\nThen, you can load TensorFlow in python as usual (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):\n\n```python\n\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.version\n'2.9.1'\n\n```\n\nThis installation of TensorFlow was built from source and the CUDA libraries it uses are found via the CUDA_HOME environment variable (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):\n\nbash\n$ echo $CUDA_HOME\n/soft/datascience/cuda/cuda_11.5.2_495.29.05_linux\n\nIf you need to build applications that use this version of TensorFlow and CUDA, we recommend using these cuda libraries to ensure compatibility.  We periodically update the TensorFlow release, though updates will come in the form of new versions of the conda module.\n\nTensorFlow is also available through NVIDIA containers that have been translated to Singularity containers.  For more information about containers, please see the Containers documentation page.\n\nTensorFlow Best Practices on Polaris\n\nSingle Node Performance\n\nWhen running TensorFlow applications, we have found the following practices to be generally, if not universally, useful and encourage you to try some of these techniques to boost performance of your own applications.\n\nUse Reduced Precision. Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with TensorFlow operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the tf.keras.mixed_precision Policy, as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  If you use a custom training loop (and not keras.Model.fit), you will also need to apply loss scaling.",

Please see NVIDIA MIG documentation for further details\n##end_quote##\n\nFrom the quote above, I can see that some GPU instances cannot be configured together, even if there is enough memory/slots available. This implies that there are restrictions on which MIG GPU instances can be configured together.\n\n2. Review the valid GPU instance configurations mentioned in the context to determine if any specific combinations are restricted.\n\nThe valid GPU instance configurations are: 1g.5gb, 1g.10gb, 2g.10gb, 3g.20gb, 4g.20gb, and 7g.40gb.\n\n3. Analyze the restrictions mentioned in the context to determine if any specific combinations of GPU instances are restricted.\n\nThe quote mentions that some GPU instances cannot be configured adjacently, specifically mentioning 3g.20gb and 4g.20gb as an example. This implies that there may be other restricted combinations beyond just these two examples.\n\nBased on this analysis, I conclude that:\n\n<ANSWER>: There are restrictions on which MIG GPU instances can be configured together, specifically some GPU instances cannot be configured adjacently, although the exact combinations of restricted instances are not explicitly listed.",

Analyze this information to determine what happens to submissions made to queues other than the ones supporting MIG config files.\n\nBased on the context, it is clear that if a submission is made to a queue that does not support MIG config files (i.e., debug, debug-scaling, and preemptable queues), any MIG config files passed will be silently ignored. This means that the submission will still run as usual, but the MIG configuration will not be applied.\n\n3.

Understand what Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) is from the context provided.\n\n##begin_quote##\nascovel@x3209c0s19b0n0:~> cat ./polaris-mig/mig_config.json\n{ ... }\nascovel@x3209c0s19b0n0:~> nvidia-smi -L | grep -Po -e \"MIG[0-9a-f-]+\"\n...\n##end_quote##\n\nFrom the context, MIG is a configuration that allows multiple instances of GPU memory to be allocated from a single physical GPU. This is evident from the `mig_config.json` file and the output of `nvidia-smi -L | grep -Po -e \"MIG[0-9a-]+\"`.\n\n2. Identify the MIG configurations in the context.\n\nFrom the `mig_config.json` file, we can see that there are two groups: group1 and group2. Each group has a list of GPUs (`gpus`) and an instance configuration (`instances`). The `mig_enabled` flag is set to true for both groups, indicating that MIG is enabled.\n\n3. Determine the number of MIG instances in each group.\n\nFrom the `mig_config.json` file, we can see that group1 has two instances: \"4c.7g.40gb\" and \"3c.7g.40gb\", while group2 has three instances: \"2c.4g.20gb\", \"2c.4g.20gb\", and \"2g.10gb\".\n\n4. Answer the question.\n\nBased on the context, we can conclude that MIG is a configuration that allows multiple instances of GPU memory to be allocated from a single physical GPU. The number of MIG instances in each group is 2 for group1 and 3 for group2.\n\n<ANSWER>: Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) is a configuration that allows multiple instances of GPU memory to be allocated from a single physical GPU, with 2 instances in group1 and 3 instances in group2.",

            "LAMMPS\n\nOverview\n\nLAMMPS is a general-purpose molecular dynamics software package for massively parallel computers. It is written in an exceptionally clean style that makes it one of the more popular codes for users to extend and it currently has dozens of user-developed extensions.\n\nFor details about the code and its usage, see the LAMMPS home page. This page provides information specific to running on Polaris at the ALCF.\n\nUsing LAMMPS at ALCF\n\nALCF provides assistance with build instructions, compiling executables, submitting jobs, and providing prebuilt binaries (upon request). A collection of Makefiles and submission scripts are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo here. For questions, contact us at support@alcf.anl.gov.\n\nHow to Obtain the Code\n\nLAMMPS is an open-source code, which can be downloaded from the LAMMPS website.\n\nBuilding on Polaris\n\nAfter LAMMPS has been downloaded and unpacked on an ALCF filesystem, users should see a directory whose name is of the form lammps-<version>. One should then see the Makefile lammps-<version>/src/MAKE/MACHINES/Makefile.polaris in recent versions that can be used as a starting point for compilation on Polaris. Copies of Makefiles for building with the GPU/KOKKOS package using CUDA for GPU support with the GNU/NVHPC compiler are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo here. For older versions of LAMMPS, you may need to take an existing Makefile (e.g. Makefile.mpi) for your specific version of LAMMPS and edit the top portion appropratiately to create a new Makefile.polaris.\n\nKOKKOS package and GNU compilers\n\nThe following modules are useful for this particular build. Note, the cmake module is not required if using the GNU Makefile procedure to build LAMMPS. The initial module restore is just setting the default environment as the starting point. Users may find it useful to copy these module commands into a small helper script to assist with compiling and running LAMMPS (e.g. setup_lammps_gnu.sh).",

            "Spack PE\n\nSpack is an HPC-oriented package manager which ALCF uses to install software for\nthe user environment.\n\nALCF's Spack PE is a Spack-managed software stack which provides various build\ntools, utilities, and libraries. It consists of a base stack (spack-pe-base)\nand PrgEnv-dependent stacks (currently spack-pe-gnu).\n\nspack-pe-base contains commonplace software compiled for CPU with the system\nGCC compilers. Accordingly, the software in spack-pe-base can be used\nregardless of programming environment.\n\nspack-pe-gnu is based on the E4S Project and\nprovides performant HPC libraries built with PrgEnv-gnu and the nvcc CUDA\ncompiler driver for GPU code. spack-pe-gnu is dependent on both\nspack-pe-base and PrgEnv-gnu.\n\nUsing software from the Spack PE\n\nThe base suite of software tools and libraries can be accessed by loading the\nspack-pe-base module. This adds a path to $MODULEPATH which contains\nnumerous modules.\n\nFor example, to load cmake starting from the default environment, a user\nshould run the following commands:\nmodule use /soft/modulefiles\nmodule load spack-pe-base\nmodule load cmake\n\nThe spack-pe-base module adds paths to the user's MODULEPATH; individual packages are subsequently loaded through the newly available modules. The full list of available packages can be viewed by running module avail or module --show-hidden avail for a complete listing. Packages are loaded in the same way from spack-pe-gnu.\n\nInspecting packages\n\nWhen a module in the Spack PE is loaded, several environment variables are\nupdated to integrate the package into the user's environment. Additionally, the\nPACKAGE_ROOT variable is set to the path to the installation prefix of the\npackage. For example, after loading cmake as above:\n\n$ echo $CMAKE_ROOT\n/soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/install/linux-sles15-x86_64/gcc-12.3.0/cmake-3.27.7-a435jtzvweeos2es6enirbxdjdqhqgdp/\n$ ls -a $CMAKE_ROOT\n.  ..  bin  doc  share  .spack",

Here's a step-by-step reasoning on how to do this:\n\n1. First, list all available MIG instances using the command `nvidia-smi -L | grep -Po -e \"MIG[0-9a-f-]+\"`. This will give us a list of MIG instance IDs.\n2. Next, we can use a loop to iterate over each MIG instance and set the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable to the current MIG instance ID. We can do this using a command like `for mig in $( nvidia-smi -L | grep -Po -e \"MIG[0-9a-]+\") ; do CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=${mig} ./saxpy & done 2>/dev/null`.\n3.

            "Julia\n\nJulia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for\ntechnical computing. It has a syntax familiar to users of many other\ntechnical computing environments. Designed at MIT to tackle large-scale\npartial-differential equation simulation and distributed linear algebra, Julia\nfeatures a robust ecosystem of tools for\noptimization,\nstatistics, parallel programming, and data\nvisualization. Julia is actively developed by the Julia\nLabs team at MIT and in\nindustry, along with hundreds of domain-expert\nscientists and programmers worldwide.\n\nContributing\n\nThis guide is a first draft of the Julia documentation for Polaris. If you have any\nsuggestions or contributions, please open a pull request or contact us by\nopening a ticket at the ALCF Helpdesk.\n\nJulia Installation\n\nWe encourage users interested in using Julia on Polaris to install in their home or project directories at this time. Using the official Julia 1.9 binaries from the Julia\nwebpage is recommended.\nJuliaup provides a convenient way to\ninstall Julia and manage the various Julia versions. The default installation will install julia, juliaup, and other commands in a ${HOME}/.julia directory and update profile files like .bashrc to update PATH to include that directory. One can customize the installation to change these defaults.\n\nbash\nmodule load craype-accel-nvidia80\ncurl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh\n\nIf you chose a custom installation, then be sure to update the PATH environment variable appropriately.\n\nexport PATH=${HOME}/.juliaup/bin:${PATH}\n\nYou may then list the available Julia versions with juliaup list and install a\nspecific version with juliaup install <version>. You can then activate a\nspecific version with juliaup use <version> and set the default version with\njuliaup default <version>. juliaup update will update the installed Julia\nversions. In general, the latest stable release of Julia should be used.\n\nbash\njuliaup add release\n\nJulia Project Environment",
            "Mixed C/C++ & Fortran Applications\n\nFor applications consisting of a mix of C/C++ and Fortran that also uses MPI, it is suggested that the programming environment chosen for Fortran be used to build the full application because of mpi.mod (and similar) incompatibilities.\n\nCompiling for GPUs\n\nIt is assumed the majority of applications to be built on Polaris will make use of the GPUs. As such, the craype-accel-nvidia80 module is in the default environment. This has the effect of the Cray compiler wrappers adding -gpu to the compiler invocation along with additional include paths and libraries. Additional compilers flags may be needed depending on the compiler and GPU programming model used (e.g. -cuda, -acc, or -mp=gpu).\n\nThis module also adds GPU Transport Layer (GTL) libraries to the link-line to support GPU-aware MPI applications.\n\nMan Pages\n\nFor additional information on the Cray wrappers, please refer to the man pages.\nman cc\nman CC\nman ftn"

Otherwise, you'll likely see GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED is requested, but GTL library is not linked errors during runtime.\n- If running on a specific GPU or subset of GPUs is desired, then the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable can be used.

For applications that need this support, this instead can be handled by use of a small helper script that will appropriately set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES for each MPI rank. One example is available here where each MPI rank is similarly bound to a single GPU with round-robin assignment.\n\nA example set_affinity_gpu_polaris.sh script follows where GPUs are assigned round-robin to MPI ranks.\n\n```bash\n\n!/bin/bash -l\n\nnum_gpus=4\n\nneed to assign GPUs in reverse order due to topology\n\nSee Polaris Device Affinity Information:\n\nhttps://www.alcf.anl.gov/support/user-guides/polaris/hardware-overview/machine-overview/index.html",

            "TensorFlow on Polaris\n\nTensorFlow is a popular, open-source deep learning framework developed and released by Google.  The TensorFlow home page has more information about TensorFlow, which you can refer to.  For trouble shooting on Polaris, please contact support@alcf.anl.gov.\n\nInstallation on Polaris\n\nTensorFlow is already pre-installed on Polaris, available in the conda module.  To use it from a compute node, please do:\n\nbash\nmodule load conda\nconda activate\n\nThen, you can load TensorFlow in python as usual (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):\n\n```python\n\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.version\n'2.9.1'\n\n```\n\nThis installation of TensorFlow was built from source and the CUDA libraries it uses are found via the CUDA_HOME environment variable (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):\n\nbash\n$ echo $CUDA_HOME\n/soft/datascience/cuda/cuda_11.5.2_495.29.05_linux\n\nIf you need to build applications that use this version of TensorFlow and CUDA, we recommend using these cuda libraries to ensure compatibility.  We periodically update the TensorFlow release, though updates will come in the form of new versions of the conda module.\n\nTensorFlow is also available through NVIDIA containers that have been translated to Singularity containers.  For more information about containers, please see the Containers documentation page.\n\nTensorFlow Best Practices on Polaris\n\nSingle Node Performance\n\nWhen running TensorFlow applications, we have found the following practices to be generally, if not universally, useful and encourage you to try some of these techniques to boost performance of your own applications.\n\nUse Reduced Precision. Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with TensorFlow operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the tf.keras.mixed_precision Policy, as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  If you use a custom training loop (and not keras.Model.fit), you will also need to apply loss scaling.",

            "Parsl on Polaris\n\nParsl is a flexible and scalable parallel programming library for Python.\n\n-- Parsl Documentation\n\nFor many applications, managing an ensemble of jobs into a workflow is a critical step that can easily become a performance bottleneck.  Many tools exist to address this, of which parsl is just one.  On this page, we'll highlight some of the key pieces of information about parsl that are relevant to Polaris.  Parsl is also extensively documented, has a dedicated Slack Channel, and a large community of users and developers beyond ALCF.  We encourage you to engage with the parsl community for support with parsl specific questions, and for Polaris-specific questions or problems, please contact support@alcf.anl.gov.\n\nGetting Parsl on Polaris\n\nYou can install parsl building off of the conda modules.  You have some flexibility in how you want to extend the conda module to include parsl, but here is an example way to do it:\n\n```python\n\nLoad the Conda Module (needed everytime you use parsl)\n\nmodule load conda\nconda activate\n\nCreate a virtual env that uses the conda env as the system packages.\n\nOnly do the next line on initial set up:\n\npython -m venv --system-site-packages /path/to/your/virtualenv\n\nLoad the virtual env (every time):\n\nsource /path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/activate\n\nInstall parsl (only once)\n\npip install parsl\n\n```\n\nUsing Parsl on Polaris\n\nParsl has a variety of possible configuration settings.  As an example, we provide the configuration below that will run one task per GPU:\n\n```python\nfrom parsl.config import Config\n\nPBSPro is the right provider for Polaris:\n\nfrom parsl.providers import PBSProProvider\n\nThe high throughput executor is for scaling to HPC systems:\n\nfrom parsl.executors import HighThroughputExecutor\n\nYou can use the MPI launcher, but may want the Gnu Parallel launcher, see below\n\nfrom parsl.launchers import MpiExecLauncher, GnuParallelLauncher\n\naddress_by_interface is needed for the HighThroughputExecutor:"

It is written in an exceptionally clean style that makes it one of the more popular codes for users to extend and it currently has dozens of user-developed extensions.\n\nFor details about the code and its usage, see the LAMMPS home page. This page provides information specific to running on Polaris at the ALCF.\n\nUsing LAMMPS at ALCF\n\nALCF provides assistance with build instructions, compiling executables, submitting jobs, and providing prebuilt binaries (upon request). A collection of Makefiles and submission scripts are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo here. For questions, contact us at support@alcf.anl.gov.\n\nHow to Obtain the Code\n\nLAMMPS is an open-source code, which can be downloaded from the LAMMPS website.\n\nBuilding on Polaris\n\nAfter LAMMPS has been downloaded and unpacked on an ALCF filesystem, users should see a directory whose name is of the form lammps-<version>. One should then see the Makefile lammps-<version>/src/MAKE/MACHINES/Makefile.polaris in recent versions that can be used as a starting point for compilation on Polaris. Copies of Makefiles for building with the GPU/KOKKOS package using CUDA for GPU support with the GNU/NVHPC compiler are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo here. For older versions of LAMMPS, you may need to take an existing Makefile (e.g. Makefile.mpi) for your specific version of LAMMPS and edit the top portion appropratiately to create a new Makefile.polaris.\n\nKOKKOS package and GNU compilers\n\nThe following modules are useful for this particular build. Note, the cmake module is not required if using the GNU Makefile procedure to build LAMMPS. The initial module restore is just setting the default environment as the starting point.

For this reason, it is recommended to use start_method=\"spawn\" on Polaris when using the MpiExecLauncher as is shown in the example config above.  Alternatively, another solution is to use the GNUParallelLauncher which uses GNU Parallel to spawn processes.  GNU Parallel can be loaded in your environment with the command module load gnu-parallel.  Both of these approaches will circumvent the hang issue from using fork.\n\nUpdates\n\nFor parsl versions after July 2023, the address passed in the HighThroughputExecutor needs to be set to address = address_by_interface(\"bond0\").  With parsl versions prior to July 2023, it was recommended to use address = address_by_hostname() on Polaris, but with later versions this will not work on Polaris (or any other machine).",

For performance, it will likely be necessary to ensure that each application runs on a distinct set of CPU resources and/or targets specific GPUs. One can provide a list of CPUs using the --cpu-bind option, which when combined with CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES provides a user with specifying exactly which CPU and GPU resources to run each application on. In the example below, four instances of the application are simultaneously running on a single node. In the first instance, the application is spawning MPI ranks 0-7 on CPUs 24-31 and using GPU 0. This mapping is based on output from the nvidia-smi topo -m command and pairs CPUs with the closest GPU.\n\n```bash\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:24:25:26:27:28:29:30:31 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:16:17:18:19:20:21:22:23 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:8:9:10:11:12:13:14:15 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=3\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:0:1:2:3:4:5:6:7 ./hello_affinity &\n\nwait\n```\n\nCompute Node Access to the Internet\n\nCurrently, the only access the internet is via a proxy.

For this reason, it is recommended to use start_method=\"spawn\" on Polaris when using the MpiExecLauncher as is shown in the example config above.  Alternatively, another solution is to use the GNUParallelLauncher which uses GNU Parallel to spawn processes.  GNU Parallel can be loaded in your environment with the command module load gnu-parallel.  Both of these approaches will circumvent the hang issue from using fork.\n\nUpdates\n\nFor parsl versions after July 2023, the address passed in the HighThroughputExecutor needs to be set to address = address_by_interface(\"bond0\").  With parsl versions prior to July 2023, it was recommended to use address = address_by_hostname() on Polaris, but with later versions this will not work on Polaris (or any other machine).",

                "Parsl on Polaris\n\nParsl is a flexible and scalable parallel programming library for Python.\n\n-- Parsl Documentation\n\nFor many applications, managing an ensemble of jobs into a workflow is a critical step that can easily become a performance bottleneck.  Many tools exist to address this, of which parsl is just one.  On this page, we'll highlight some of the key pieces of information about parsl that are relevant to Polaris.  Parsl is also extensively documented, has a dedicated Slack Channel, and a large community of users and developers beyond ALCF.  We encourage you to engage with the parsl community for support with parsl specific questions, and for Polaris-specific questions or problems, please contact support@alcf.anl.gov.\n\nGetting Parsl on Polaris\n\nYou can install parsl building off of the conda modules.  You have some flexibility in how you want to extend the conda module to include parsl, but here is an example way to do it:\n\n```python\n\nLoad the Conda Module (needed everytime you use parsl)\n\nmodule load conda\nconda activate\n\nCreate a virtual env that uses the conda env as the system packages.\n\nOnly do the next line on initial set up:\n\npython -m venv --system-site-packages /path/to/your/virtualenv\n\nLoad the virtual env (every time):\n\nsource /path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/activate\n\nInstall parsl (only once)\n\npip install parsl\n\n```\n\nUsing Parsl on Polaris\n\nParsl has a variety of possible configuration settings.  As an example, we provide the configuration below that will run one task per GPU:\n\n```python\nfrom parsl.config import Config\n\nPBSPro is the right provider for Polaris:\n\nfrom parsl.providers import PBSProProvider\n\nThe high throughput executor is for scaling to HPC systems:\n\nfrom parsl.executors import HighThroughputExecutor\n\nYou can use the MPI launcher, but may want the Gnu Parallel launcher, see below\n\nfrom parsl.launchers import MpiExecLauncher, GnuParallelLauncher\n\naddress_by_interface is needed for the HighThroughputExecutor:",

            "Use TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.  Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.  When possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention.\n\nUse XLA compilation on your code.  XLA is the Accelerated Linear Algebra library that is available in tensorFlow and critical in software like JAX.  XLA will compile a tf.Graph object, generated with tf.function or similar, and perform optimizations like operation-fusion.  XLA can give impressive performance boosts with almost no user changes except to set an environment variable TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2.  If your code is complex, or has dynamically sized tensors (tensors where the shape changes every iteration), XLA can be detrimental: the overhead for compiling functions can be large enough to mitigate performance improvements.  XLA is particularly powerful when combined with reduced precision, yielding speedups > 100% in some models.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nTensorFlow is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with tensorFlow has been seen with horovod in particular.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation.  Some polaris specific details that may be helpful to you:\n\nCPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.  In particular, we encourage users to try their scaling measurements with the following settings:\n\nSet the environment variable NCCL_COLLNET_ENABLE=1",

        "question": "How many points are generated by the `approximate_pi_gpu(n)` function in each run?",
        "cot_answer": "To answer this question, we need to analyze the `approximate_pi_gpu` function. This function generates points using CUDA.rand and then uses a kernel to determine whether each point is inside or outside a quarter circle.\n\nThe kernel function `pi_kernel(x, y, d, n)` takes four arguments: `x`, `y`, `d`, and `n`. It calculates the distance of each point from the origin and checks if it's within the quarter circle. If it is, it sets the corresponding element in the array `d` to 1; otherwise, it sets it to 0.\n\nThe function does not explicitly generate points or calculate pi. Instead, it uses a kernel to determine whether each point is inside or outside the quarter circle. Therefore, we cannot directly determine how many points are generated by this function.\n\nHowever, if we look at the `main` function, we can see that it generates `n` random points using CUDA.rand and stores them in the arrays `x` and `y`. This suggests that the `approximate_pi_gpu` function is used to generate these points.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that the `approximate_pi_gpu` function does not directly generate points. Instead, it uses a kernel to determine whether each point is inside or outside the quarter circle. Therefore, we cannot determine how many points are generated by this function without additional information.\n\n<ANSWER>: The approximate_pi_gpu function generates no points.",

The craype-x86-milan module is expected to be made default once a newer nvhpc version (e.g. 22.5) is made the default.\n\ncraype-accel-nvidia80: This module adds compiler flags to enable GPU acceleration for NVHPC compilers along with gpu-enabled MPI libraries as it is assumed that the majority of applications to be compiled on Polaris will target the GPUs for acceleration.

Polaris supports\nrunning multiple concurrent simulations on each node if desired.\n\nA simple example batch script for a libEnsemble use case that runs five workers on one node:\n\n```shell\n    #!/bin/bash -l\n    #PBS -l select=1:system=polaris\n    #PBS -l walltime=00:15:00\n    #PBS -l filesystems=home:grand\n    #PBS -q debug\n    #PBS -A\n\n```\n\nThe script can be run with:\n\nOr you can run an interactive session with:\n\nFurther links\n\nDocs:\n\nhttps://libensemble.readthedocs.io\n\nGitHub:\n\nhttps://github.com/Libensemble/libensemble",

If you are just starting with ParaView, we recommend the client/server mode as your primary method for using this tool.\n\nSetting up ParaView\n\nFrom your local client select Connect, either from the File menu, or by clicking on the icon circled below:\n\nA new window will open where you can configure a server. Click on Add Server:\n\nGive your server a name, select Client/Server, localhost, and a TCP port (8000 in this example)\n\nClick \"Configure\". In the next window there is an option to set up how ParaView server will be launched, and the default is \"Manual\". Leave it on \"Manual\" and click \"Save\".\n\nYou will use these settings when establishing the connection.\n\nLaunching the ParaView server on Polaris\n\nYou can launch an interactive session on Polaris compute nodes with the following command (adjust parameters as needed to match your allocation, desired number of nodes, queue, walltime, and filesystems):\n\nshell\nqsub -l walltime=01:00:00 -l select=2 -A yourallocation -q debug -I -l filesystems=home:grand\n\nWhen the job starts you will receive a prompt on your head node like this:\n\nusername@x3005c0s7b0n0:~>\n\nMake a note of the node hostname (x3005c0s7b0n0 in the example above). You can also get this information from qstat -fx jobID\n\nNow load the ParaView module\n\nusername@x3005c0s7b0n0:~> module use /soft/modulefiles \nusername@x3005c0s7b0n0:~> module load visualization/paraview/paraview-5.12.0-EGL\n\nand launch the ParaView server with"

        "cot_answer": "Here's my step-by-step reasoning to answer this question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the error message**\nThe error message is \"AssertionError: Micro batch sizer per gpu: 0 has to be greater than 0\". This suggests that there's an issue with the micro batch size per GPU, which needs to be greater than 0.\n\n**Step 2: Check the context for relevant information**\nIn the context, we see that DeepSpeed is pre-installed in the base conda environment on Polaris. We also have instructions for using or cloning this environment, as well as a batch submission script for running an example model with DeepSpeed support.\n\n**Step 3: Identify potential causes of the error**\nGiven the error message and the context, I suspect that the issue might be related to how we're setting up our DeepSpeed configuration. Specifically, I think we might need to adjust the micro batch size per GPU in our configuration file.\n\n**Step 4: Check the configuration file**\nLet's take a look at the configuration file for the cifar example provided in the DeepSpeedExamples repository (##begin_quote##... navigate into the directory: .../DeepSpeedExamples/cifar ##end_quote##). We might need to adjust the micro batch size per GPU in this file.\n\n**Step 5: Provide the solution**\nTo fix the error, we can try adjusting the micro batch size per GPU in our configuration file. For example, we could set it to a value greater than 0, such as 32 or 64.\n\n**Final Answer**\n<ANSWER>: Try setting the micro batch size per GPU to a value greater than 0 (e.g., 32 or 64) in your configuration file.",

Users are encouraged to email support@alcf.anl.gov to report issues.\n\nSubmitting Jobs\n\nFor batch job submissions, if the parameters within your submission script do not meet the parameters of any of the execution queues (small, ..., backfill-large) you might not receive the \"Job submission\" error on the command line at all, and the job will never appear in history qstat -xu <username> (current bug in PBS). E.g. if a user submits a script to the prod routing queue requesting 10 nodes for 24 hours, exceeding \"Time Max\" of 6 hrs of the small execution queue (which handles jobs with 10-24 nodes), then it may behave as if the job was never submitted.\n\nJob scripts are copied to temporary locations after qsub and any changes to the original script while the job is queued will not be reflected in the copied script. Furthermore, qalter requires -A <allocation name> when changing job properties. Currently, there is a request for a qalter-like command to trigger a re-copy of the original script to the temporary location.\n\nCompiling & Running Applications\n\nIf your job fails to start with an RPC launch message like below, please forward the complete messages to support@alcf.anl.gov.\n\nbash\n   launch failed on x3104c0s1b0n0: Couldn't forward RPC launch(ab751d77-e80a-4c54-b1c2-4e881f7e8c90) to child x3104c0s31b0n0.hsn.cm.polaris.alcf.anl.gov: Resource temporarily unavailable",

            "Use Reduced Precision. Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with PyTorch operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the PyTorch Automatic Mixed Precision package (AMP), as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  In PyTorch, users generally need to manage casting and loss scaling manually,  though context managers and function decorators can provide easy tools to do this.\n\nPyTorch has a JIT module as well as backends to support op fusion, similar to TensorFlow's tf.function tools.  However, PyTorch JIT capabilities are newer and may not yield performance improvements.  Please see TorchScript for more information.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nPyTorch is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with PyTorch has been seen with both DDP and Horovod.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation or the Distributed Data Parallel documentation.  Some Polaris-specific details that may be helpful to you:\n\nCPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.  In particular, we encourage users to try their scaling measurements with the following settings:\n\nSet the environment variable NCCL_COLLNET_ENABLE=1\n\nSet the environment varialbe NCCL_NET_GDR_LEVEL=PHB\n\nManually set the CPU affinity via mpiexec, such as with --cpu-bind verbose,list:0,8,16,24"

We encourage you to engage with the parsl community for support with parsl specific questions, and for Polaris-specific questions or problems, please contact support@alcf.anl.gov.\n\nGetting Parsl on Polaris\n\nYou can install parsl building off of the conda modules.  You have some flexibility in how you want to extend the conda module to include parsl, but here is an example way to do it:\n\n```python\n\nLoad the Conda Module (needed everytime you use parsl)\n\nmodule load conda\nconda activate\n\nCreate a virtual env that uses the conda env as the system packages.\n\nOnly do the next line on initial set up:\n\npython -m venv --system-site-packages /path/to/your/virtualenv\n\nLoad the virtual env (every time):\n\nsource /path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/activate\n\nInstall parsl (only once)\n\npip install parsl\n\n```\n\nUsing Parsl on Polaris\n\nParsl has a variety of possible configuration settings.  As an example, we provide the configuration below that will run one task per GPU:\n\n```python\nfrom parsl.config import Config\n\nPBSPro is the right provider for Polaris:\n\nfrom parsl.providers import PBSProProvider\n\nThe high throughput executor is for scaling to HPC systems:\n\nfrom parsl.executors import HighThroughputExecutor\n\nYou can use the MPI launcher, but may want the Gnu Parallel launcher, see below\n\nfrom parsl.launchers import MpiExecLauncher, GnuParallelLauncher\n\naddress_by_interface is needed for the HighThroughputExecutor:",

            "Compiling and Linking Overview on Polaris\n\nCompiling on Polaris Login and Compute Nodes\n\nIf your build system does not require GPUs for the build process, as is usually the case, compilation of GPU-accelerated codes is generally expected to work well on the Polaris login nodes. If your build system does require GPUs, you cannot yet compile on the Polaris login nodes, as they do not currently have GPUs installed. You may in this case compile your applications on the Polaris compute nodes. Do this by submitting an interactive single-node job, or running your build system in a batch job.\n\nHome File System\n\nIs it helpful to realize that there is a single HOME filesystem for users that can be accessed from the login and computes of each production resource at ALCF. Thus, users should be mindful of modifications to their environments (e.g. .bashrc) that may cause issues to arise due to differences between the systems.\n\nCray Programming Environment\n\nThe Cray Programming Environment (PE) uses three compiler wrappers for building software. These compiler wrappers should be used when building MPI-enabled applications.\n\ncc - C compiler\n\nCC - C++ compiler\n\nftn - Fortran compiler\n\nEach of these wrappers can select a specific vendor compiler based on the PrgEnv module loaded in the environment. The following are some helpful options to understand what the compiler wrapper is invoking.\n\n--craype-verbose : Print the command which is forwarded to the compiler invocation\n\n--cray-print-opts=libs : Print library information\n\n--cray-print-opts=cflags : Print include information\n\nThe output from these commands may be useful in build scripts where a compiler other than that invoked by a compiler wrapper is desired. Defining some variables as such may prove useful in those situations.\nCRAY_CFLAGS=$(cc --cray-print-opts=cflags)\nCRAY_LIB=$(cc --cray-print-opts=libs)\nFurther documentation and options are available via man cc and similar.\n\nCompilers provided by Cray Programming Environments",

It consists of a base stack (spack-pe-base)\nand PrgEnv-dependent stacks (currently spack-pe-gnu).\n\nspack-pe-base contains commonplace software compiled for CPU with the system\nGCC compilers. Accordingly, the software in spack-pe-base can be used\nregardless of programming environment.\n\nspack-pe-gnu is based on the E4S Project and\nprovides performant HPC libraries built with PrgEnv-gnu and the nvcc CUDA\ncompiler driver for GPU code. spack-pe-gnu is dependent on both\nspack-pe-base and PrgEnv-gnu.\n\nUsing software from the Spack PE\n\nThe base suite of software tools and libraries can be accessed by loading the\nspack-pe-base module. This adds a path to $MODULEPATH which contains\nnumerous modules.\n\nFor example, to load cmake starting from the default environment, a user\nshould run the following commands:\nmodule use /soft/modulefiles\nmodule load spack-pe-base\nmodule load cmake\n\nThe spack-pe-base module adds paths to the user's MODULEPATH; individual packages are subsequently loaded through the newly available modules. The full list of available packages can be viewed by running module avail or module --show-hidden avail for a complete listing. Packages are loaded in the same way from spack-pe-gnu.\n\nInspecting packages\n\nWhen a module in the Spack PE is loaded, several environment variables are\nupdated to integrate the package into the user's environment. Additionally, the\nPACKAGE_ROOT variable is set to the path to the installation prefix of the\npackage. For example, after loading cmake as above:\n\n$ echo $CMAKE_ROOT\n/soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/install/linux-sles15-x86_64/gcc-12.3.0/cmake-3.27.7-a435jtzvweeos2es6enirbxdjdqhqgdp/\n$ ls -a $CMAKE_ROOT\n.  ..  bin  doc  share  .spack",

This approach can lead to slower performance and less efficient operations.\n\nOn the other hand, `@tf.function` uses tracing to replace your Python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. This graph is optimized for performance and can be executed more efficiently than regular Python code.\n\n##begin_quote##\nWhen possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention.\n##end_quote##\n\nIn summary, `@tf.function` differs from regular function execution by compiling Python code into a TensorFlow Graph, which can lead to improved performance and efficiency.\n\n**What benefits do they bring to the table?**\n\nThe benefits of using `@tf.function` include:\n\n* Improved performance: By compiling Python code into a TensorFlow Graph, you can achieve better performance and efficiency.\n* Better support for XLA compilation: `@tf.function` enables XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra) compilation, which can provide additional performance boosts.\n\n##begin_quote##\nXLA is particularly powerful when combined with reduced precision, yielding speedups > 100% in some models.\n##end_quote##\n\nIn summary, the benefits of using `@tf.function` include improved performance and better support for XLA compilation.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n<ANSWER>: @tf.function differs from regular function execution by compiling Python code into a TensorFlow Graph, which can lead to improved performance and efficiency.

            "JAX\n\nJAX is another popular python package for accelerated computing.  JAX is built on XLA (the same XLA TensorFlow uses) as well as AutoGrad, and additionally has acceleration tools that operate on functions such as vmap, jit, etc.  JAX is not as widespread in machine learning as TensorFlow and PyTorch for traditional models (Computer Vision, Language Models) though it is quickly gaining promienence.  JAX is very powerful when a program needs non-traditional autodifferentiation or vectorizatoin, such as: forward-mode AD, higher order derivatives, Jacobians, Hessians, or any combination of the above.  Users of JAX on Polaris are encouraged to read the user documentation in detail, particularly the details about pure-functional programming, no in-place operations, and the common mistakes in writing functions for the @jit decorator.\n\nJAX on Polaris\n\nJAX is installed on Polaris via the conda module, available with:\nbash\nmodule load conda; conda activate\n\nThen, you can load JAX in python as usual (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):\n\n```python\n\nimport jax\njax.version\n'0.3.15'\n\n```\n\nNotes on JAX 0.3.15\n\nOn Polaris, due to a bug, an environment variable must be set to use JAX on GPUs.  The following code will crash:\npython\nimport jax.numpy as numpy\na = numpy.zeros(1000)\noutputting an error that looks like:\npython\njaxlib.xla_extension.XlaRuntimeError: UNKNOWN: no kernel image is available for execution on the device\n\nYou can fix this by setting an environment variable:\nbash\nexport XLA_FLAGS=\"--xla_gpu_force_compilation_parallelism=1\"\n\nScaling JAX to multiple GPUs and multiple Nodes\n\nJax has intrinsic scaling tools to use multiple GPUs on a single node, via the pmap function.  If this is sufficient for your needs, excellent.  If not, another alternative is to use the newer package mpi4jax.",

The TensorFlow home page has more information about TensorFlow, which you can refer to.  For trouble shooting on Polaris, please contact support@alcf.anl.gov.\n\nInstallation on Polaris\n\nTensorFlow is already pre-installed on Polaris, available in the conda module.  To use it from a compute node, please do:\n\nbash\nmodule load conda\nconda activate\n\nThen, you can load TensorFlow in python as usual (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):\n\n```python\n\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.version\n'2.9.1'\n\n```\n\nThis installation of TensorFlow was built from source and the CUDA libraries it uses are found via the CUDA_HOME environment variable (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):\n\nbash\n$ echo $CUDA_HOME\n/soft/datascience/cuda/cuda_11.5.2_495.29.05_linux\n\nIf you need to build applications that use this version of TensorFlow and CUDA, we recommend using these cuda libraries to ensure compatibility.

Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with TensorFlow operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the tf.keras.mixed_precision Policy, as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.

Here's how we can do it:\n\n```\nimport os\nimport horovod as hvd\n\n# Set NCCL_COLLNET_ENABLE=1 and NCCL_NET_GDR_LEVEL=PHB\nos.environ[\"NCCL_COLLNET_ENABLE\"] = \"1\"\nos.environ[\"NCCL_NET_GDR_LEVEL\"] = \"PHB\"\n\n# Manually set the CPU affinity via mpiexec, such as with --cpu-bind verbose,list:0,8,16,24\n# (This step is not directly related to setting CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES, but it's included in the context)\n\n# Initialize Horovod and get the local rank\nhvd.init()\nlocal_rank = hvd.local_rank()\n\n# Dynamically set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES based on the local rank\nos.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = str(local_rank)\n```\n\n4. This way, we ensure that CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES is set before importing Horovod or doing MPI.COMM_WORLD.init(), which is important for Horovod to work correctly.\n\n<ANSWER>: The final answer is: os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = str(hvd.local_rank()).",

To set up Apptainer, run:\n\nbash\nmodule use /soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/install/modulefiles/Core\nmodule load apptainer\napptainer version #1.2.2\n\nThe Apptainer version on Polaris is 1.2.2. Detailed user documentation is available here\n\nBuilding from Docker or Argonne GitHub Container Registry\n\nContainers on Polaris can be built by writing Dockerfiles on a local machine and then publish the container to DockerHub, or by directly building them on ALCF compute node by writing an Apptainer recipe file. If you prefer to use existing containers, you can pull them from various registries like DockerHub and run them on Polaris.\n\nSince Docker requires root privileges, which users do not have on Polaris, existing Docker containers must be converted to Apptainer. To build a Docker-based container on Polaris, use the following as an example:",

            "Mapping Programming Models to Polaris Modules\n\nThe table below offers some suggestions for how to get started setting up your environment on Polaris depending on the programming language and model. Note, mixed C/C++ and Fortran applications should choose the programming environment for the Fortran compiler because of mpi.mod and similar incompatibilities between Fortran-generated files from different compilers. Several simple examples for testing the software environment on Polaris for different programming models are available in the ALCF GettingStart repo.\n\nNote, users are encouraged to use PrgEnv-nvhpc instead of PrgEnv-nvidia as the latter will soon be deprecated in Cray's PE. They are otherwise identical pointing to compilers from the same NVIDIA SDK version.\n\nProgramming Language GPU Programming Model Likely used Modules/Compilers Notes C/C++ CUDA PrgEnv-nvhpc, PrgEnv-gnu, llvm NVIDIA (nvcc, nvc, nvc++) and clang compilers do GPU code generation C/C++ HIP N/A need to install with support for A100 C/C++ Kokkos See CUDA HIP, OpenMP, and SYCL/DPC++ also candidates C/C++ OpenACC PrgEnv-nvhpc C/C++ OpenCL PrgEnv-nvhpc, PrgEnv-gnu, llvm JIT GPU code generation C/C++ OpenMP PrgEnv-nvhpc, llvm C/C++ RAJA See CUDA HIP, OpenMP, and SYCL/DPC++ also candidates C/C++ SYCL/DPC++ llvm-sycl  Fortran CUDA PrgEnv-nvhpc NVIDIA compiler (nvfortran) does GPU code generation; gfortran can be loaded via gcc-mixed Fortran HIP N/A need to install with support for A100 Fortran OpenACC PrgEnv-nvhpc Fortran OpenCL PrgEnv-nvhpc, PrgEnv-gnu JIT GPU code generation Fortran OpenMP PrgEnv-nvhpc",

The default in Julia is to download artifacts (e.g. CUDA toolkit) based on the runtime detected. While that should generally work, it is recommended to use the local CUDA installation provided on Polaris especially if using gpu-aware MPI in your workloads (important to use supported versions of CUDA with Cray MPICH provided).\n\nTo use the local CUDA installation provided by the modules on Polaris, the LocalPreferences.toml file can be modified as follows.\n\n$ head $JULIA_DEPOT_PATH/environments/v1.10/LocalPreferences.toml\n[CUDA_Runtime_jll]\nlocal = true\n\nIf using the default PrgEnv-nvhpc module on Polaris, then it will be necessary to correct a path to the CUPTI library to successfully install CUDA.jl.\n\n$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$CRAY_NVIDIA_PREFIX/cuda/12.2/extras/CUPTI/lib64/\n$ julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(\"CUDA\")'\n\nThe GPUs are not currently usable on the Polaris login nodes, so one can confirm the version of CUDA being used by testing in a batch or interactive job on a compute node.\n\n```\n$ qsub -I -l select=1,walltime=1:00:00,filesystems=home:grand:eagle -A [PROJECT] -q debug\n\n$ julia --project -e \"using CUDA; CUDA.versioninfo()\"\nCUDA runtime 12.4, artifact installation\nCUDA driver 12.4\nNVIDIA driver 535.154.5, originally for CUDA 12.2\n\nCUDA libraries: \n- CUBLAS: 12.2.1\n- CURAND: 10.3.5\n- CUFFT: 11.2.1\n- CUSOLVER: 11.6.1\n- CUSPARSE: 12.3.1\n- CUPTI: 22.0.0\n- NVML: 12.0.0+535.154.5",

This submits the script to one node in the debug queue on Polaris, requesting 30 min and the eagle and home filesystems. It will charge project Catalyst for the time.\n\nMore details for setting up the job script are in Job Scheduling and Execution section.\n\nExample\n\n```\n$ cat hello.cpp\n\ninclude\n\ninclude\n\nint main( int argv, char** argc ) {\n\nprintf( \"Number of devices: %d\\n\", omp_get_num_devices() );",

            "Use TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.  Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.  When possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention.\n\nUse XLA compilation on your code.  XLA is the Accelerated Linear Algebra library that is available in tensorFlow and critical in software like JAX.  XLA will compile a tf.Graph object, generated with tf.function or similar, and perform optimizations like operation-fusion.  XLA can give impressive performance boosts with almost no user changes except to set an environment variable TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2.  If your code is complex, or has dynamically sized tensors (tensors where the shape changes every iteration), XLA can be detrimental: the overhead for compiling functions can be large enough to mitigate performance improvements.  XLA is particularly powerful when combined with reduced precision, yielding speedups > 100% in some models.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nTensorFlow is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with tensorFlow has been seen with horovod in particular.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation.  Some polaris specific details that may be helpful to you:\n\nCPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.  In particular, we encourage users to try their scaling measurements with the following settings:\n\nSet the environment variable NCCL_COLLNET_ENABLE=1",

Overall job state is aggregated on the Balsam Server, making job data from all Sites accessible from any individual site (or the user's laptop), via the command-line interface or the Python API. To get information on how to use the command line tool, you can type balsam --help in your shell.\n\nFull documentation for Balsam is available online.\n\nBalsam requires Python 3.7+.

This consists of running the ParaView client on your local resource, and the ParaView server on the Polaris compute nodes. The ParaView client needs to first be installed on your local resource, and needs to match the version that you run on Polaris.\n\nThere are multiple versions of ParaView installed on Polaris. To find the versions of ParaView currently available on Polaris run the following command on a login node: \nmodule use /soft/modulefiles\nmodule avail paraview\n\nBinary and source packages of the ParaView client for Linux, MacOS, and Windows are available from the ParaView Download Page.\n\nConnecting to the ParaView server on Polaris\n\nThis section describes how to launch the ParaView server on Polaris from a local ParaView client.\n\nStart ParaView Client\n\nFirst, launch the ParaView client on your local resource. You will need to configure some server settings in the client. This initial set up should only need to be done once, and can be reused each time you want to run ParaView on Polaris.\n\nServer Configuration\n\n1. Select Connect\n\nFrom the ParaView client choose to connect to a server by either clicking on the \"Connect\" icon in the menu bar\n\nor selecting File->Connect from the main menu\n\n2. Set Up Servers (first time only)\n\nThe first time you want to run a server on Polaris and have it connect to your local ParaView client, you will need to set up a Server. Once this server is set up, you can reuse it each time you run the ParaView client with the ParaView server on Polaris.\n\nKitware, the developers of ParaView, maintain a database of server configurations which you can retrieve through the ParaView client. In the File->Connect menu press the button named \"Fetch Servers\" and select POLARIS@ANL. Windows users should select \"windows to POLARIS@ANL\". Press \"Import Selected\"\n\n3. Use ParaView",

However, PyTorch JIT capabilities are newer and may not yield performance improvements.  Please see TorchScript for more information.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nPyTorch is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with PyTorch has been seen with both DDP and Horovod.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation or the Distributed Data Parallel documentation.  Some Polaris-specific details that may be helpful to you:\n\nCPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.  In particular, we encourage users to try their scaling measurements with the following settings:\n\nSet the environment variable NCCL_COLLNET_ENABLE=1\n\nSet the environment varialbe NCCL_NET_GDR_LEVEL=PHB\n\nManually set the CPU affinity via mpiexec, such as with --cpu-bind verbose,list:0,8,16,24",

                "Known Issues\n\nThis is a collection of known issues that have been encountered on Polaris. Documentation will be updated as issues are resolved. Users are encouraged to email support@alcf.anl.gov to report issues.\n\nSubmitting Jobs\n\nFor batch job submissions, if the parameters within your submission script do not meet the parameters of any of the execution queues (small, ..., backfill-large) you might not receive the \"Job submission\" error on the command line at all, and the job will never appear in history qstat -xu <username> (current bug in PBS). E.g. if a user submits a script to the prod routing queue requesting 10 nodes for 24 hours, exceeding \"Time Max\" of 6 hrs of the small execution queue (which handles jobs with 10-24 nodes), then it may behave as if the job was never submitted.\n\nJob scripts are copied to temporary locations after qsub and any changes to the original script while the job is queued will not be reflected in the copied script. Furthermore, qalter requires -A <allocation name> when changing job properties. Currently, there is a request for a qalter-like command to trigger a re-copy of the original script to the temporary location.\n\nCompiling & Running Applications\n\nIf your job fails to start with an RPC launch message like below, please forward the complete messages to support@alcf.anl.gov.\n\nbash\n   launch failed on x3104c0s1b0n0: Couldn't forward RPC launch(ab751d77-e80a-4c54-b1c2-4e881f7e8c90) to child x3104c0s31b0n0.hsn.cm.polaris.alcf.anl.gov: Resource temporarily unavailable",

See the Spack section below for details.\n\nSpack\n\nWe have newly installed Spack deployments in /soft. Spack is an HPC-oriented\npackage manager which ALCF uses to install software for the user environment.\nHowever, no knowledge of Spack is necessary to use these software offerings. All\nALCF-managed software is accessible to users via modules.\n\nThe base suite of software tools and libraries can be accessed by loading the\nspack-pe-base module. This adds a path to $MODULEPATH which contains\nnumerous modules.\n\nFor example, to load cmake starting from the default environment, a user\nshould run the following commands:\nmodule use /soft/modulefiles\nmodule load spack-pe-base\nmodule load cmake\nOther modules in spack-pe-base can be browsed by running module avail or\nmodule --show-hidden avail. The latter shows hidden modules which are\ninstalled as dependencies of the un-hidden modules.\n\nIn addition to the base stack, a suite of higher-level libraries are installed\nin the spack-pe-gnu module. These are built with and are dependent on\nPrgEnv-gnu. A PrgEnv-nvidia-compatible stack will be available in the\nfuture.\n\nNote that not all software is installed through Spack; many applications and\nlibraries are installed as standalone packages in /soft. Users are encouraged\nto browse the available modules with module avail to see what software is\ninstalled on the system.\n\nParaView and Visit",

The `awk` command is used to split the path into its components and extract the first one, which is the installation directory.\n\nAlternatively, `NVROOT` can be set manually by specifying the installation path directly.\n\n##begin_quote##\n...or set NVROOT manually\nNVHPC      ?=  /opt/nvidia/hpc_sdk\nNVVERSION  = 23.9\nNVROOT     = $ (NVHPC) /Linux_x86_64/$(NVVERSION)\n##end_quote##\n\nIn this case, `NVROOT` is set to the concatenation of the `NVHPC` directory and the `NVVERSION` string.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<ANSWER>: The role of the `NVROOT` variable in setting the installation path for the NV HPC-SDK is to specify either the automatically detected or manually specified installation path.",

CUDA-GDB is an extension to GDB, the GNU Project debugger. The tool provides developers with a mechanism for debugging CUDA applications running on actual hardware. This enables developers to debug applications without the potential variations introduced by simulation and emulation environments.\n\nStep-by-step guide\n\nDebug Compilation\n\nNVCC, the NVIDIA CUDA compiler driver, provides a mechanism for generating the debugging information necessary for CUDA-GDB to work properly. The -g -G option pair must be passed to NVCC when an application is compiled for ease of debugging with CUDA-GDB; for example,\nnvcc -g -G foo.cu -o foo\nUsing this line to compile the CUDA application foo.cu\n* forces -O0 compilation, with the exception of very limited dead-code eliminations and register-spilling optimizations.\n* makes the compiler include debug information in the executable\n\nRunning CUDA-gdb on Polaris compute nodes\n\nStart an interactive job mode on Polaris as follows:\n\n```\n$ qsub -I -l select=1 -l walltime=1:00:00\n\n$ cuda-gdb --version\nNVIDIA (R) CUDA Debugger\n11.4 release\nPortions Copyright (C) 2007-2021 NVIDIA Corporation\nGNU gdb (GDB) 10.1\nCopyright (C) 2020 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nLicense GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html\nThis is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.\nThere is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.\n\n$ cuda-gdb foo\n```\n\nA quick example with a stream benchmark on a Polaris compute node\n\n```\njkwack@polaris-login-02:~> qsub -I -l select=1 -l walltime=1:00:00\nqsub: waiting for job 308834.polaris-pbs-01.hsn.cm.polaris.alcf.anl.gov to start\nqsub: job 308834.polaris-pbs-01.hsn.cm.polaris.alcf.anl.gov ready",

            "JAX\n\nJAX is another popular python package for accelerated computing.  JAX is built on XLA (the same XLA TensorFlow uses) as well as AutoGrad, and additionally has acceleration tools that operate on functions such as vmap, jit, etc.  JAX is not as widespread in machine learning as TensorFlow and PyTorch for traditional models (Computer Vision, Language Models) though it is quickly gaining promienence.  JAX is very powerful when a program needs non-traditional autodifferentiation or vectorizatoin, such as: forward-mode AD, higher order derivatives, Jacobians, Hessians, or any combination of the above.  Users of JAX on Polaris are encouraged to read the user documentation in detail, particularly the details about pure-functional programming, no in-place operations, and the common mistakes in writing functions for the @jit decorator.\n\nJAX on Polaris\n\nJAX is installed on Polaris via the conda module, available with:\nbash\nmodule load conda; conda activate\n\nThen, you can load JAX in python as usual (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):\n\n```python\n\nimport jax\njax.version\n'0.3.15'\n\n```\n\nNotes on JAX 0.3.15\n\nOn Polaris, due to a bug, an environment variable must be set to use JAX on GPUs.  The following code will crash:\npython\nimport jax.numpy as numpy\na = numpy.zeros(1000)\noutputting an error that looks like:\npython\njaxlib.xla_extension.XlaRuntimeError: UNKNOWN: no kernel image is available for execution on the device\n\nYou can fix this by setting an environment variable:\nbash\nexport XLA_FLAGS=\"--xla_gpu_force_compilation_parallelism=1\"\n\nScaling JAX to multiple GPUs and multiple Nodes\n\nJax has intrinsic scaling tools to use multiple GPUs on a single node, via the pmap function.  If this is sufficient for your needs, excellent.  If not, another alternative is to use the newer package mpi4jax."

            "Running Multiple MPI Applications on a node\n\nMultiple applications can be run simultaneously on a node by launching several mpiexec commands and backgrounding them. For performance, it will likely be necessary to ensure that each application runs on a distinct set of CPU resources and/or targets specific GPUs. One can provide a list of CPUs using the --cpu-bind option, which when combined with CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES provides a user with specifying exactly which CPU and GPU resources to run each application on. In the example below, four instances of the application are simultaneously running on a single node. In the first instance, the application is spawning MPI ranks 0-7 on CPUs 24-31 and using GPU 0. This mapping is based on output from the nvidia-smi topo -m command and pairs CPUs with the closest GPU.\n\n```bash\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:24:25:26:27:28:29:30:31 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:16:17:18:19:20:21:22:23 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:8:9:10:11:12:13:14:15 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=3\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:0:1:2:3:4:5:6:7 ./hello_affinity &\n\nwait\n```\n\nCompute Node Access to the Internet\n\nCurrently, the only access the internet is via a proxy.

        "cot_answer": "Here's my step-by-step reasoning to answer the question:\n\nThe question asks about the significance of using `nvc++ --no_warnings` in the CXX_PARS variable. To understand this, let's first look at what CXX_PARS is supposed to do.\n\n##begin_quote##\nCXX_PARS    = nvc++ --no_warnings -I/.../include/c++/10.2.0/ ... -I/.../lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/10.2.0/include ...\n##end_quote##\n\nFrom this, we can see that CXX_PARS is a variable that defines the compiler and flags to be used for compiling C++ code. The `nvc++` part suggests that it's using the Cray compiler wrapper ftn to load additional math libraries for the CPU.\n\nNow, let's focus on the `--no_warnings` flag. This flag tells the compiler to suppress warnings while compiling. In other words, it disables warning messages that would normally be printed by the compiler.\n\nSo, in summary, using `nvc++ --no_warnings` in CXX_PARS means that when compiling C++ code with this variable, the compiler will not print any warning messages. This is likely done to avoid cluttering the output with unnecessary warnings and make it easier to focus on actual errors or issues.\n\n<ANSWER>: The significance of using `nvc++ --no_warnings` in CXX_PARS is that it suppresses warning messages while compiling, making it easier to focus on actual errors or issues.",

In this case, it will be important to have the craype-accel-nvidia80 module loaded both when compiling your application and during runtime to correctly link against a GPU Transport Layer (GTL) MPI library. Otherwise, you'll likely see GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED is requested, but GTL library is not linked errors during runtime.\n- If running on a specific GPU or subset of GPUs is desired, then the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable can be used. For example, if one only wanted an application to access the first two GPUs on a node, then setting CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 could be used.\n\nBinding MPI ranks to GPUs\n\nThe Cray MPI on Polaris does not currently support binding MPI ranks to GPUs. For applications that need this support, this instead can be handled by use of a small helper script that will appropriately set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES for each MPI rank. One example is available here where each MPI rank is similarly bound to a single GPU with round-robin assignment.\n\nA example set_affinity_gpu_polaris.sh script follows where GPUs are assigned round-robin to MPI ranks.\n\n```bash\n\n!/bin/bash -l\n\nnum_gpus=4\n\nneed to assign GPUs in reverse order due to topology\n\nSee Polaris Device Affinity Information:\n\nhttps://www.alcf.anl.gov/support/user-guides/polaris/hardware-overview/machine-overview/index.html",

            "Parsl on Polaris\n\nParsl is a flexible and scalable parallel programming library for Python.\n\n-- Parsl Documentation\n\nFor many applications, managing an ensemble of jobs into a workflow is a critical step that can easily become a performance bottleneck.  Many tools exist to address this, of which parsl is just one.  On this page, we'll highlight some of the key pieces of information about parsl that are relevant to Polaris.  Parsl is also extensively documented, has a dedicated Slack Channel, and a large community of users and developers beyond ALCF.  We encourage you to engage with the parsl community for support with parsl specific questions, and for Polaris-specific questions or problems, please contact support@alcf.anl.gov.\n\nGetting Parsl on Polaris\n\nYou can install parsl building off of the conda modules.  You have some flexibility in how you want to extend the conda module to include parsl, but here is an example way to do it:\n\n```python\n\nLoad the Conda Module (needed everytime you use parsl)\n\nmodule load conda\nconda activate\n\nCreate a virtual env that uses the conda env as the system packages.\n\nOnly do the next line on initial set up:\n\npython -m venv --system-site-packages /path/to/your/virtualenv\n\nLoad the virtual env (every time):\n\nsource /path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/activate\n\nInstall parsl (only once)\n\npip install parsl\n\n```\n\nUsing Parsl on Polaris\n\nParsl has a variety of possible configuration settings.  As an example, we provide the configuration below that will run one task per GPU:\n\n```python\nfrom parsl.config import Config\n\nPBSPro is the right provider for Polaris:\n\nfrom parsl.providers import PBSProProvider\n\nThe high throughput executor is for scaling to HPC systems:\n\nfrom parsl.executors import HighThroughputExecutor\n\nYou can use the MPI launcher, but may want the Gnu Parallel launcher, see below\n\nfrom parsl.launchers import MpiExecLauncher, GnuParallelLauncher\n\naddress_by_interface is needed for the HighThroughputExecutor:"

Users are encouraged to email support@alcf.anl.gov to report issues.\n\nSubmitting Jobs\n\nFor batch job submissions, if the parameters within your submission script do not meet the parameters of any of the execution queues (small, ..., backfill-large) you might not receive the \"Job submission\" error on the command line at all, and the job will never appear in history qstat -xu <username> (current bug in PBS). E.g. if a user submits a script to the prod routing queue requesting 10 nodes for 24 hours, exceeding \"Time Max\" of 6 hrs of the small execution queue (which handles jobs with 10-24 nodes), then it may behave as if the job was never submitted.\n\nJob scripts are copied to temporary locations after qsub and any changes to the original script while the job is queued will not be reflected in the copied script. Furthermore, qalter requires -A <allocation name> when changing job properties. Currently, there is a request for a qalter-like command to trigger a re-copy of the original script to the temporary location.\n\nCompiling & Running Applications\n\nIf your job fails to start with an RPC launch message like below, please forward the complete messages to support@alcf.anl.gov.\n\nbash\n   launch failed on x3104c0s1b0n0: Couldn't forward RPC launch(ab751d77-e80a-4c54-b1c2-4e881f7e8c90) to child x3104c0s31b0n0.hsn.cm.polaris.alcf.anl.gov: Resource temporarily unavailable",

            "LAMMPS\n\nOverview\n\nLAMMPS is a general-purpose molecular dynamics software package for massively parallel computers. It is written in an exceptionally clean style that makes it one of the more popular codes for users to extend and it currently has dozens of user-developed extensions.\n\nFor details about the code and its usage, see the LAMMPS home page. This page provides information specific to running on Polaris at the ALCF.\n\nUsing LAMMPS at ALCF\n\nALCF provides assistance with build instructions, compiling executables, submitting jobs, and providing prebuilt binaries (upon request). A collection of Makefiles and submission scripts are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo here. For questions, contact us at support@alcf.anl.gov.\n\nHow to Obtain the Code\n\nLAMMPS is an open-source code, which can be downloaded from the LAMMPS website.\n\nBuilding on Polaris\n\nAfter LAMMPS has been downloaded and unpacked on an ALCF filesystem, users should see a directory whose name is of the form lammps-<version>. One should then see the Makefile lammps-<version>/src/MAKE/MACHINES/Makefile.polaris in recent versions that can be used as a starting point for compilation on Polaris. Copies of Makefiles for building with the GPU/KOKKOS package using CUDA for GPU support with the GNU/NVHPC compiler are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo here. For older versions of LAMMPS, you may need to take an existing Makefile (e.g. Makefile.mpi) for your specific version of LAMMPS and edit the top portion appropratiately to create a new Makefile.polaris.\n\nKOKKOS package and GNU compilers\n\nThe following modules are useful for this particular build. Note, the cmake module is not required if using the GNU Makefile procedure to build LAMMPS. The initial module restore is just setting the default environment as the starting point. Users may find it useful to copy these module commands into a small helper script to assist with compiling and running LAMMPS (e.g. setup_lammps_gnu.sh).",

Many compiler vendors provide implementations of the OpenMP specification (https://www.openmp.org/specifications).\n\nSetting the environment to use OpenMP on Polaris\n\nMany of the programming environments available on Polaris have OpenMP support.\n\nmodule OpenMP CPU support?

To switch to other modules, you can use module switch.\n\nUsing PrgEnv-nvhpc\n\nThis is loaded by default, so there's no need to load additional modules. You can confirm that it is loaded by running module list to check that PrgEnv-nvhpc is in the list.\n\nUsing LLVM\n\nTo use the LLVM module, load the following.\nmodule load mpiwrappers/cray-mpich-llvm\nmodule load cudatoolkit-standalone\n\nSee the the LLVM compiling page here for more information.\n\nUsing PrgEnv-gnu\n\nTo switch from PrgEnv-nvhpc to PrgEnv-gnu you can run:\n\nmodule switch PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-gnu\n\nThe gcc/gfortran on Polaris was not built with GPU support.

You may in this case compile your applications on the Polaris compute nodes. Do this by submitting an interactive single-node job, or running your build system in a batch job.\n\nHome File System\n\nIs it helpful to realize that there is a single HOME filesystem for users that can be accessed from the login and computes of each production resource at ALCF. Thus, users should be mindful of modifications to their environments (e.g. .bashrc) that may cause issues to arise due to differences between the systems.\n\nCray Programming Environment\n\nThe Cray Programming Environment (PE) uses three compiler wrappers for building software.

It is written in an exceptionally clean style that makes it one of the more popular codes for users to extend and it currently has dozens of user-developed extensions.\n\nFor details about the code and its usage, see the LAMMPS home page. This page provides information specific to running on Polaris at the ALCF.\n\nUsing LAMMPS at ALCF\n\nALCF provides assistance with build instructions, compiling executables, submitting jobs, and providing prebuilt binaries (upon request). A collection of Makefiles and submission scripts are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo here. For questions, contact us at support@alcf.anl.gov.\n\nHow to Obtain the Code\n\nLAMMPS is an open-source code, which can be downloaded from the LAMMPS website.\n\nBuilding on Polaris\n\nAfter LAMMPS has been downloaded and unpacked on an ALCF filesystem, users should see a directory whose name is of the form lammps-<version>. One should then see the Makefile lammps-<version>/src/MAKE/MACHINES/Makefile.polaris in recent versions that can be used as a starting point for compilation on Polaris. Copies of Makefiles for building with the GPU/KOKKOS package using CUDA for GPU support with the GNU/NVHPC compiler are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo here. For older versions of LAMMPS, you may need to take an existing Makefile (e.g. Makefile.mpi) for your specific version of LAMMPS and edit the top portion appropratiately to create a new Makefile.polaris.\n\nKOKKOS package and GNU compilers\n\nThe following modules are useful for this particular build. Note, the cmake module is not required if using the GNU Makefile procedure to build LAMMPS. The initial module restore is just setting the default environment as the starting point. Users may find it useful to copy these module commands into a small helper script to assist with compiling and running LAMMPS (e.g. setup_lammps_gnu.sh).",

            "Compiling and Linking Overview on Polaris\n\nCompiling on Polaris Login and Compute Nodes\n\nIf your build system does not require GPUs for the build process, as is usually the case, compilation of GPU-accelerated codes is generally expected to work well on the Polaris login nodes. If your build system does require GPUs, you cannot yet compile on the Polaris login nodes, as they do not currently have GPUs installed. You may in this case compile your applications on the Polaris compute nodes. Do this by submitting an interactive single-node job, or running your build system in a batch job.\n\nHome File System\n\nIs it helpful to realize that there is a single HOME filesystem for users that can be accessed from the login and computes of each production resource at ALCF. Thus, users should be mindful of modifications to their environments (e.g. .bashrc) that may cause issues to arise due to differences between the systems.\n\nCray Programming Environment\n\nThe Cray Programming Environment (PE) uses three compiler wrappers for building software. These compiler wrappers should be used when building MPI-enabled applications.\n\ncc - C compiler\n\nCC - C++ compiler\n\nftn - Fortran compiler\n\nEach of these wrappers can select a specific vendor compiler based on the PrgEnv module loaded in the environment. The following are some helpful options to understand what the compiler wrapper is invoking.\n\n--craype-verbose : Print the command which is forwarded to the compiler invocation\n\n--cray-print-opts=libs : Print library information\n\n--cray-print-opts=cflags : Print include information\n\nThe output from these commands may be useful in build scripts where a compiler other than that invoked by a compiler wrapper is desired. Defining some variables as such may prove useful in those situations.\nCRAY_CFLAGS=$(cc --cray-print-opts=cflags)\nCRAY_LIB=$(cc --cray-print-opts=libs)\nFurther documentation and options are available via man cc and similar.\n\nCompilers provided by Cray Programming Environments",

        "cot_answer": "To adjust the number of ranks and depth in an LAMMPS simulation to optimize performance, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the current settings**: The context provides the current values for `NRANKS`, `NDEPTH`, and other parameters. We can see that `NRANKS` is set to 4, which means each node will have 4 ranks, and `NDEPTH` is set to 8.\n\n2. **Determine the optimal number of ranks**: The optimal number of ranks depends on the specific problem being simulated and the available resources (e.g., nodes, cores). A general rule of thumb is to start with a small number of ranks (e.g., 4-8) and increase it until you reach the maximum performance.\n\n3. **Adjust the depth**: The depth parameter controls how many levels of parallelism are used in the simulation. A higher depth can lead to better scalability, but may also increase communication overhead. We can start with a moderate value (e.g., 8) and adjust it based on performance measurements.\n\n4. **Monitor performance**: Run the simulation with the adjusted parameters and monitor its performance using tools like `mpirun` or `lammps` itself. If the performance is not satisfactory, we can adjust the parameters further until we reach the desired level of performance.\n\n**Final Answer**: <ANSWER>: Adjust `NRANKS` to a value that balances computational efficiency with communication overhead, and adjust `NDEPTH` based on performance measurements.",

The Cray MPI wrappers will handle this automatically.\n\nNotes on Default Modules\n\ncraype-x86-rome: While the Polaris compute nodes currently have Milan CPUs, this module is loaded by default to avoid the craype-x86-milan module from adding a zen3 target not supported in the default nvhpc/21.9 compilers. The craype-x86-milan module is expected to be made default once a newer nvhpc version (e.g. 22.5) is made the default.\n\ncraype-accel-nvidia80: This module adds compiler flags to enable GPU acceleration for NVHPC compilers along with gpu-enabled MPI libraries as it is assumed that the majority of applications to be compiled on Polaris will target the GPUs for acceleration. Users building cpu-only applications may find it useful to unload this module to silence \"gpu code generation\" warnings.\n\nMixed C/C++ & Fortran Applications",
            "Use TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.  Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.  When possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention.\n\nUse XLA compilation on your code.  XLA is the Accelerated Linear Algebra library that is available in tensorFlow and critical in software like JAX.  XLA will compile a tf.Graph object, generated with tf.function or similar, and perform optimizations like operation-fusion.  XLA can give impressive performance boosts with almost no user changes except to set an environment variable TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2.  If your code is complex, or has dynamically sized tensors (tensors where the shape changes every iteration), XLA can be detrimental: the overhead for compiling functions can be large enough to mitigate performance improvements.  XLA is particularly powerful when combined with reduced precision, yielding speedups > 100% in some models.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nTensorFlow is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with tensorFlow has been seen with horovod in particular.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation.  Some polaris specific details that may be helpful to you:\n\nCPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.  In particular, we encourage users to try their scaling measurements with the following settings:\n\nSet the environment variable NCCL_COLLNET_ENABLE=1",

If you want all your nodes grouped in a rack, you can add the group specifier -l select=8:system=foo,place=scatter:group=tier0.

            "Parsl on Polaris\n\nParsl is a flexible and scalable parallel programming library for Python.\n\n-- Parsl Documentation\n\nFor many applications, managing an ensemble of jobs into a workflow is a critical step that can easily become a performance bottleneck.  Many tools exist to address this, of which parsl is just one.  On this page, we'll highlight some of the key pieces of information about parsl that are relevant to Polaris.  Parsl is also extensively documented, has a dedicated Slack Channel, and a large community of users and developers beyond ALCF.  We encourage you to engage with the parsl community for support with parsl specific questions, and for Polaris-specific questions or problems, please contact support@alcf.anl.gov.\n\nGetting Parsl on Polaris\n\nYou can install parsl building off of the conda modules.  You have some flexibility in how you want to extend the conda module to include parsl, but here is an example way to do it:\n\n```python\n\nLoad the Conda Module (needed everytime you use parsl)\n\nmodule load conda\nconda activate\n\nCreate a virtual env that uses the conda env as the system packages.\n\nOnly do the next line on initial set up:\n\npython -m venv --system-site-packages /path/to/your/virtualenv\n\nLoad the virtual env (every time):\n\nsource /path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/activate\n\nInstall parsl (only once)\n\npip install parsl\n\n```\n\nUsing Parsl on Polaris\n\nParsl has a variety of possible configuration settings.  As an example, we provide the configuration below that will run one task per GPU:\n\n```python\nfrom parsl.config import Config\n\nPBSPro is the right provider for Polaris:\n\nfrom parsl.providers import PBSProProvider\n\nThe high throughput executor is for scaling to HPC systems:\n\nfrom parsl.executors import HighThroughputExecutor\n\nYou can use the MPI launcher, but may want the Gnu Parallel launcher, see below\n\nfrom parsl.launchers import MpiExecLauncher, GnuParallelLauncher\n\naddress_by_interface is needed for the HighThroughputExecutor:",

For this reason, it is recommended to use start_method=\"spawn\" on Polaris when using the MpiExecLauncher as is shown in the example config above.  Alternatively, another solution is to use the GNUParallelLauncher which uses GNU Parallel to spawn processes.  GNU Parallel can be loaded in your environment with the command module load gnu-parallel.  Both of these approaches will circumvent the hang issue from using fork.\n\nUpdates\n\nFor parsl versions after July 2023, the address passed in the HighThroughputExecutor needs to be set to address = address_by_interface(\"bond0\").  With parsl versions prior to July 2023, it was recommended to use address = address_by_hostname() on Polaris, but with later versions this will not work on Polaris (or any other machine).",

In general, the way to do this is via the PyTorch Automatic Mixed Precision package (AMP), as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  In PyTorch, users generally need to manage casting and loss scaling manually,  though context managers and function decorators can provide easy tools to do this.\n\nPyTorch has a JIT module as well as backends to support op fusion, similar to TensorFlow's tf.function tools.  However, PyTorch JIT capabilities are newer and may not yield performance improvements.

Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with PyTorch has been seen with both DDP and Horovod.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation or the Distributed Data Parallel documentation.  Some Polaris-specific details that may be helpful to you:\n\nCPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.  In particular, we encourage users to try their scaling measurements with the following settings:\n\nSet the environment variable NCCL_COLLNET_ENABLE=1\n\nSet the environment varialbe NCCL_NET_GDR_LEVEL=PHB\n\nManually set the CPU affinity via mpiexec, such as with --cpu-bind verbose,list:0,8,16,24",

            "Use TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.  Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.  When possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention.\n\nUse XLA compilation on your code.  XLA is the Accelerated Linear Algebra library that is available in tensorFlow and critical in software like JAX.  XLA will compile a tf.Graph object, generated with tf.function or similar, and perform optimizations like operation-fusion.  XLA can give impressive performance boosts with almost no user changes except to set an environment variable TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2.  If your code is complex, or has dynamically sized tensors (tensors where the shape changes every iteration), XLA can be detrimental: the overhead for compiling functions can be large enough to mitigate performance improvements.  XLA is particularly powerful when combined with reduced precision, yielding speedups > 100% in some models.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nTensorFlow is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with tensorFlow has been seen with horovod in particular.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation.  Some polaris specific details that may be helpful to you:\n\nCPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.  In particular, we encourage users to try their scaling measurements with the following settings:\n\nSet the environment variable NCCL_COLLNET_ENABLE=1",

For example, the -cuda flag instructs nvcc to compile .cu input files to .cu.cpp.ii output files which are to be separately compiled, whereas the same -cuda flag instructs nvc, nvc++, and nvfortran to enable CUDA C/C++ or CUDA Fortran code generation.

This adds a path to $MODULEPATH which contains\nnumerous modules.\n\nFor example, to load cmake starting from the default environment, a user\nshould run the following commands:\nmodule use /soft/modulefiles\nmodule load spack-pe-base\nmodule load cmake\n\nThe spack-pe-base module adds paths to the user's MODULEPATH; individual packages are subsequently loaded through the newly available modules. The full list of available packages can be viewed by running module avail or module --show-hidden avail for a complete listing. Packages are loaded in the same way from spack-pe-gnu.\n\nInspecting packages\n\nWhen a module in the Spack PE is loaded, several environment variables are\nupdated to integrate the package into the user's environment.

            "Parsl on Polaris\n\nParsl is a flexible and scalable parallel programming library for Python.\n\n-- Parsl Documentation\n\nFor many applications, managing an ensemble of jobs into a workflow is a critical step that can easily become a performance bottleneck.  Many tools exist to address this, of which parsl is just one.  On this page, we'll highlight some of the key pieces of information about parsl that are relevant to Polaris.  Parsl is also extensively documented, has a dedicated Slack Channel, and a large community of users and developers beyond ALCF.  We encourage you to engage with the parsl community for support with parsl specific questions, and for Polaris-specific questions or problems, please contact support@alcf.anl.gov.\n\nGetting Parsl on Polaris\n\nYou can install parsl building off of the conda modules.  You have some flexibility in how you want to extend the conda module to include parsl, but here is an example way to do it:\n\n```python\n\nLoad the Conda Module (needed everytime you use parsl)\n\nmodule load conda\nconda activate\n\nCreate a virtual env that uses the conda env as the system packages.\n\nOnly do the next line on initial set up:\n\npython -m venv --system-site-packages /path/to/your/virtualenv\n\nLoad the virtual env (every time):\n\nsource /path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/activate\n\nInstall parsl (only once)\n\npip install parsl\n\n```\n\nUsing Parsl on Polaris\n\nParsl has a variety of possible configuration settings.  As an example, we provide the configuration below that will run one task per GPU:\n\n```python\nfrom parsl.config import Config\n\nPBSPro is the right provider for Polaris:\n\nfrom parsl.providers import PBSProProvider\n\nThe high throughput executor is for scaling to HPC systems:\n\nfrom parsl.executors import HighThroughputExecutor\n\nYou can use the MPI launcher, but may want the Gnu Parallel launcher, see below\n\nfrom parsl.launchers import MpiExecLauncher, GnuParallelLauncher\n\naddress_by_interface is needed for the HighThroughputExecutor:",

A summary of available CPU parallel programming models and relevant compiler flags is shown below. Users are encouraged to review the corresponding man pages and documentation.\n\nProgramming Model GNU NVHPC LLVM OpenMP -fopenmp -mp -fopenmp OpenACC -- -acc=multicore --\n\nHigher-level programming models such as Kokkos and Raja may also be used for CPU programming.\n\nGPU Programming Models\n\nA summary of available GPU programming models and relevant compiler flags is shown below for compilers that generate offloadable code. Users are encouraged to review the corresponding man pages and documentation.\n\nProgramming Model GNU NVHPC LLVM ONEAPI CUDA -- -cuda [-gpu=cuda8.0,cc11.0] -- -- HIP* -- -- -- -- OpenACC -- -acc -- -- OpenCL* -- -- -- -- OpenMP -- -mp=gpu -fopenmp-targets=nvptx64 -- SYCL -- -- -- -fsycl -fsycl-targets=nvptx64-nvidia-cuda -Xsycl-target-backend --cuda-gpu-arch=sm_80\n\nNote, the llvm and oneapi modules are provided by ALCF to complement the compilers provided by the Cray PE on Polaris.\n\nHigher-level programming models such as Kokkos and Raja may also be used for GPU programming.\n\nOpenCL is supported, but does not require specific compiler flags per-se as the offloaded kernels are just-in-time compiled. Abstraction programming models, such as Kokkos, can be built on top of some of these programming models (see below).\n\nA HIP compiler supporting the A100 GPUs is still to be installed on Polaris.\n\nMapping Programming Models to Polaris Modules",

Note that if you import mpi4py or horovod, and then do something like os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = hvd.local_rank(), it may not actually work!  You must set the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable prior to doing MPI.COMM_WORLD.init(), which is done in horovod.init() as well as implicitly in from mpi4py import MPI.   On Polaris specifically, you can use the environment variable PMI_LOCAL_RANK (as well as PMI_LOCAL_SIZE) to learn information about the node-local MPI ranks.\n\nTensorFlow Dataloaders\n\nAdditional information to be provided.",

The GNU compilers are available via another programming environment.

The Cray MPI wrappers will handle this automatically.\n\nNotes on Default Modules\n\ncraype-x86-rome: While the Polaris compute nodes currently have Milan CPUs, this module is loaded by default to avoid the craype-x86-milan module from adding a zen3 target not supported in the default nvhpc/21.9 compilers. The craype-x86-milan module is expected to be made default once a newer nvhpc version (e.g. 22.5) is made the default.\n\ncraype-accel-nvidia80: This module adds compiler flags to enable GPU acceleration for NVHPC compilers along with gpu-enabled MPI libraries as it is assumed that the majority of applications to be compiled on Polaris will target the GPUs for acceleration. Users building cpu-only applications may find it useful to unload this module to silence \"gpu code generation\" warnings.\n\nMixed C/C++ & Fortran Applications"

If build your application is problematic for some reason (e.g. absence of a GPU), then users are encouraged to build and test applications directly on one of the Polaris compute nodes via an interactive job. The discussion below makes use of the NVHPC compilers in the default environment as illustrative examples. Similar examples for other compilers on Polaris are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo.\n\nCPU MPI+OpenMP Example\n\nOne of the first useful tasks with any new machine, scheduler, and job launcher is to ensure one is binding MPI ranks and OpenMP threads to the host cpu as intended.

            "LAMMPS\n\nOverview\n\nLAMMPS is a general-purpose molecular dynamics software package for massively parallel computers. It is written in an exceptionally clean style that makes it one of the more popular codes for users to extend and it currently has dozens of user-developed extensions.\n\nFor details about the code and its usage, see the LAMMPS home page. This page provides information specific to running on Polaris at the ALCF.\n\nUsing LAMMPS at ALCF\n\nALCF provides assistance with build instructions, compiling executables, submitting jobs, and providing prebuilt binaries (upon request). A collection of Makefiles and submission scripts are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo here. For questions, contact us at support@alcf.anl.gov.\n\nHow to Obtain the Code\n\nLAMMPS is an open-source code, which can be downloaded from the LAMMPS website.\n\nBuilding on Polaris\n\nAfter LAMMPS has been downloaded and unpacked on an ALCF filesystem, users should see a directory whose name is of the form lammps-<version>. One should then see the Makefile lammps-<version>/src/MAKE/MACHINES/Makefile.polaris in recent versions that can be used as a starting point for compilation on Polaris. Copies of Makefiles for building with the GPU/KOKKOS package using CUDA for GPU support with the GNU/NVHPC compiler are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo here. For older versions of LAMMPS, you may need to take an existing Makefile (e.g. Makefile.mpi) for your specific version of LAMMPS and edit the top portion appropratiately to create a new Makefile.polaris.\n\nKOKKOS package and GNU compilers\n\nThe following modules are useful for this particular build. Note, the cmake module is not required if using the GNU Makefile procedure to build LAMMPS. The initial module restore is just setting the default environment as the starting point. Users may find it useful to copy these module commands into a small helper script to assist with compiling and running LAMMPS (e.g. setup_lammps_gnu.sh).",

To use it from a compute node, please do:\n\nbash\nmodule load conda\nconda activate\n\nThen, you can load PyTorch in python as usual (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):\n\n```python\n\nimport torch\ntorch.version\n'1.12.0a0+git67ece03'\n\n```\n\nThis installation of PyTorch was built from source and the cuda libraries it uses are found via the CUDA_HOME environment variable (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):\n\nbash\n$ echo $CUDA_HOME\n/soft/datascience/cuda/cuda_11.5.2_495.29.05_linux\n\nIf you need to build applications that use this version of PyTorch and CUDA, we recommend using these cuda libraries to ensure compatibility.  We periodically update the PyTorch release, though updates will come in the form of new versions of the conda module.\n\nPyTorch is also available through nvidia containers that have been translated to Singularity containers.  For more information about containers, please see the containers documentation page.\n\nPyTorch Best Practices on Polaris\n\nSingle Node Performance\n\nWhen running PyTorch applications, we have found the following practices to be generally, if not universally, useful and encourage you to try some of these techniques to boost performance of your own applications.",

A Balsam Site runs on a node with access to the job scheduler, where it can submit and monitor jobs. Overall job state is aggregated on the Balsam Server, making job data from all Sites accessible from any individual site (or the user's laptop), via the command-line interface or the Python API. To get information on how to use the command line tool, you can type balsam --help in your shell.\n\nFull documentation for Balsam is available online.\n\nBalsam requires Python 3.7+. To install Balsam on Polaris, first set up a virtual Python environment:\n\nshell\nmodule load conda\nconda activate base\npython -m venv env\nsource env/bin/activate\npip install --upgrade pip\npip install --pre balsam\n\nTo use Balsam, users need an account on the Balsam server.  Users can get an account by contacting the ALCF Help Desk.  Once a user has an account, they can login and make a new site.  A Balsam site is a project space for your workflow. You will be prompted to select what machine (Polaris) you are working on when creating a new site:\n\nshell\nbalsam login\nbalsam site init -n new-site new-site\ncd new-site\nbalsam site start\n\nSee the Balsam documentation for full details.",

            "Spack PE\n\nSpack is an HPC-oriented package manager which ALCF uses to install software for\nthe user environment.\n\nALCF's Spack PE is a Spack-managed software stack which provides various build\ntools, utilities, and libraries. It consists of a base stack (spack-pe-base)\nand PrgEnv-dependent stacks (currently spack-pe-gnu).\n\nspack-pe-base contains commonplace software compiled for CPU with the system\nGCC compilers. Accordingly, the software in spack-pe-base can be used\nregardless of programming environment.\n\nspack-pe-gnu is based on the E4S Project and\nprovides performant HPC libraries built with PrgEnv-gnu and the nvcc CUDA\ncompiler driver for GPU code. spack-pe-gnu is dependent on both\nspack-pe-base and PrgEnv-gnu.\n\nUsing software from the Spack PE\n\nThe base suite of software tools and libraries can be accessed by loading the\nspack-pe-base module. This adds a path to $MODULEPATH which contains\nnumerous modules.\n\nFor example, to load cmake starting from the default environment, a user\nshould run the following commands:\nmodule use /soft/modulefiles\nmodule load spack-pe-base\nmodule load cmake\n\nThe spack-pe-base module adds paths to the user's MODULEPATH; individual packages are subsequently loaded through the newly available modules. The full list of available packages can be viewed by running module avail or module --show-hidden avail for a complete listing. Packages are loaded in the same way from spack-pe-gnu.\n\nInspecting packages\n\nWhen a module in the Spack PE is loaded, several environment variables are\nupdated to integrate the package into the user's environment. Additionally, the\nPACKAGE_ROOT variable is set to the path to the installation prefix of the\npackage. For example, after loading cmake as above:\n\n$ echo $CMAKE_ROOT\n/soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/install/linux-sles15-x86_64/gcc-12.3.0/cmake-3.27.7-a435jtzvweeos2es6enirbxdjdqhqgdp/\n$ ls -a $CMAKE_ROOT\n.  ..  bin  doc  share  .spack"

            "CUDA-GDB\n\nReferences\n\nNVIDIA CUDA-GDB Documentation\n\nIntroduction\n\nCUDA-GDB is the NVIDIA tool for debugging CUDA applications running on Polaris. CUDA-GDB is an extension to GDB, the GNU Project debugger. The tool provides developers with a mechanism for debugging CUDA applications running on actual hardware. This enables developers to debug applications without the potential variations introduced by simulation and emulation environments.\n\nStep-by-step guide\n\nDebug Compilation\n\nNVCC, the NVIDIA CUDA compiler driver, provides a mechanism for generating the debugging information necessary for CUDA-GDB to work properly. The -g -G option pair must be passed to NVCC when an application is compiled for ease of debugging with CUDA-GDB; for example,\nnvcc -g -G foo.cu -o foo\nUsing this line to compile the CUDA application foo.cu\n* forces -O0 compilation, with the exception of very limited dead-code eliminations and register-spilling optimizations.\n* makes the compiler include debug information in the executable\n\nRunning CUDA-gdb on Polaris compute nodes\n\nStart an interactive job mode on Polaris as follows:\n\n```\n$ qsub -I -l select=1 -l walltime=1:00:00\n\n$ cuda-gdb --version\nNVIDIA (R) CUDA Debugger\n11.4 release\nPortions Copyright (C) 2007-2021 NVIDIA Corporation\nGNU gdb (GDB) 10.1\nCopyright (C) 2020 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nLicense GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html\nThis is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.\nThere is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.\n\n$ cuda-gdb foo\n```\n\nA quick example with a stream benchmark on a Polaris compute node\n\n```\njkwack@polaris-login-02:~> qsub -I -l select=1 -l walltime=1:00:00\nqsub: waiting for job 308834.polaris-pbs-01.hsn.cm.polaris.alcf.anl.gov to start\nqsub: job 308834.polaris-pbs-01.hsn.cm.polaris.alcf.anl.gov ready",

            "Balsam\n\nBalsam is a Python-based workflow manager that helps users execute large numbers of jobs, potentially with interjob dependencies, track job outcomes, and manage postprocessing analysis. A Balsam Site runs on a node with access to the job scheduler, where it can submit and monitor jobs. Overall job state is aggregated on the Balsam Server, making job data from all Sites accessible from any individual site (or the user's laptop), via the command-line interface or the Python API. To get information on how to use the command line tool, you can type balsam --help in your shell.\n\nFull documentation for Balsam is available online.\n\nBalsam requires Python 3.7+. To install Balsam on Polaris, first set up a virtual Python environment:\n\nshell\nmodule load conda\nconda activate base\npython -m venv env\nsource env/bin/activate\npip install --upgrade pip\npip install --pre balsam\n\nTo use Balsam, users need an account on the Balsam server.  Users can get an account by contacting the ALCF Help Desk.  Once a user has an account, they can login and make a new site.  A Balsam site is a project space for your workflow. You will be prompted to select what machine (Polaris) you are working on when creating a new site:\n\nshell\nbalsam login\nbalsam site init -n new-site new-site\ncd new-site\nbalsam site start\n\nSee the Balsam documentation for full details.",

            "Use TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.  Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.  When possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention.\n\nUse XLA compilation on your code.  XLA is the Accelerated Linear Algebra library that is available in tensorFlow and critical in software like JAX.  XLA will compile a tf.Graph object, generated with tf.function or similar, and perform optimizations like operation-fusion.  XLA can give impressive performance boosts with almost no user changes except to set an environment variable TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2.  If your code is complex, or has dynamically sized tensors (tensors where the shape changes every iteration), XLA can be detrimental: the overhead for compiling functions can be large enough to mitigate performance improvements.  XLA is particularly powerful when combined with reduced precision, yielding speedups > 100% in some models.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nTensorFlow is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with tensorFlow has been seen with horovod in particular.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation.  Some polaris specific details that may be helpful to you:\n\nCPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.  In particular, we encourage users to try their scaling measurements with the following settings:\n\nSet the environment variable NCCL_COLLNET_ENABLE=1"

Adjust these values accordingly.\n\nAmong multiple lines with debug information,  you should see something like:\n\ndebug1: Local connections to LOCALHOST:8000 forwarded to remote address x3005c0s7b0n0:8000\n\nKeep this terminal open for the duration of your session to keep the ssh tunnel active.\n\nNow you are ready to launch your ParaView client locally. Keep in mind that client and servers versions must match. The ParaView version currently deployed on Polaris is 5.12.0\n\nConnecting to ParaView server\n\nConnect your ParaView client to the server configuration you created above. You can select Connect, either from the File menu, or the icon circled in the figure:\n\nand selecting the configuration you created in a previous step.\n\nThe connection should point to:\n\nlocalhost:8000\n\nIn the terminal where you launched the server you will see now that the connection is established. Note that ParaView may take a few seconds to connect. This is normal behavior.\n\nusername@x3005c0s7b0n0:~> mpirun -n 8 pvserver --server-port=8000\nWaiting for client...\nConnection URL: cs://x3005c0s7b0n0:8000\nAccepting connection(s): x3005c0s7b0n0:8000\nClient connected.\n\nAt this point you can use ParaView normally."

            "TensorFlow on Polaris\n\nTensorFlow is a popular, open-source deep learning framework developed and released by Google.  The TensorFlow home page has more information about TensorFlow, which you can refer to.  For trouble shooting on Polaris, please contact support@alcf.anl.gov.\n\nInstallation on Polaris\n\nTensorFlow is already pre-installed on Polaris, available in the conda module.  To use it from a compute node, please do:\n\nbash\nmodule load conda\nconda activate\n\nThen, you can load TensorFlow in python as usual (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):\n\n```python\n\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.version\n'2.9.1'\n\n```\n\nThis installation of TensorFlow was built from source and the CUDA libraries it uses are found via the CUDA_HOME environment variable (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):\n\nbash\n$ echo $CUDA_HOME\n/soft/datascience/cuda/cuda_11.5.2_495.29.05_linux\n\nIf you need to build applications that use this version of TensorFlow and CUDA, we recommend using these cuda libraries to ensure compatibility.  We periodically update the TensorFlow release, though updates will come in the form of new versions of the conda module.\n\nTensorFlow is also available through NVIDIA containers that have been translated to Singularity containers.  For more information about containers, please see the Containers documentation page.\n\nTensorFlow Best Practices on Polaris\n\nSingle Node Performance\n\nWhen running TensorFlow applications, we have found the following practices to be generally, if not universally, useful and encourage you to try some of these techniques to boost performance of your own applications.\n\nUse Reduced Precision. Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with TensorFlow operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the tf.keras.mixed_precision Policy, as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  If you use a custom training loop (and not keras.Model.fit), you will also need to apply loss scaling."

A Balsam Site runs on a node with access to the job scheduler, where it can submit and monitor jobs. Overall job state is aggregated on the Balsam Server, making job data from all Sites accessible from any individual site (or the user's laptop), via the command-line interface or the Python API. To get information on how to use the command line tool, you can type balsam --help in your shell.\n\nFull documentation for Balsam is available online.\n\nBalsam requires Python 3.7+.

            "Running Multiple MPI Applications on a node\n\nMultiple applications can be run simultaneously on a node by launching several mpiexec commands and backgrounding them. For performance, it will likely be necessary to ensure that each application runs on a distinct set of CPU resources and/or targets specific GPUs. One can provide a list of CPUs using the --cpu-bind option, which when combined with CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES provides a user with specifying exactly which CPU and GPU resources to run each application on. In the example below, four instances of the application are simultaneously running on a single node. In the first instance, the application is spawning MPI ranks 0-7 on CPUs 24-31 and using GPU 0. This mapping is based on output from the nvidia-smi topo -m command and pairs CPUs with the closest GPU.\n\n```bash\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:24:25:26:27:28:29:30:31 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:16:17:18:19:20:21:22:23 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:8:9:10:11:12:13:14:15 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=3\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:0:1:2:3:4:5:6:7 ./hello_affinity &\n\nwait\n```\n\nCompute Node Access to the Internet\n\nCurrently, the only access the internet is via a proxy.

If build your application is problematic for some reason (e.g. absence of a GPU), then users are encouraged to build and test applications directly on one of the Polaris compute nodes via an interactive job. The discussion below makes use of the NVHPC compilers in the default environment as illustrative examples. Similar examples for other compilers on Polaris are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo.\n\nCPU MPI+OpenMP Example\n\nOne of the first useful tasks with any new machine, scheduler, and job launcher is to ensure one is binding MPI ranks and OpenMP threads to the host cpu as intended.

Many tools exist to address this, of which parsl is just one.  On this page, we'll highlight some of the key pieces of information about parsl that are relevant to Polaris.  Parsl is also extensively documented, has a dedicated Slack Channel, and a large community of users and developers beyond ALCF.  We encourage you to engage with the parsl community for support with parsl specific questions, and for Polaris-specific questions or problems, please contact support@alcf.anl.gov.\n\nGetting Parsl on Polaris\n\nYou can install parsl building off of the conda modules.  You have some flexibility in how you want to extend the conda module to include parsl, but here is an example way to do it:\n\n```python\n\nLoad the Conda Module (needed everytime you use parsl)\n\nmodule load conda\nconda activate\n\nCreate a virtual env that uses the conda env as the system packages.\n\nOnly do the next line on initial set up:\n\npython -m venv --system-site-packages /path/to/your/virtualenv\n\nLoad the virtual env (every time):\n\nsource /path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/activate\n\nInstall parsl (only once)\n\npip install parsl\n\n```\n\nUsing Parsl on Polaris\n\nParsl has a variety of possible configuration settings.  As an example, we provide the configuration below that will run one task per GPU:\n\n```python\nfrom parsl.config import Config\n\nPBSPro is the right provider for Polaris:\n\nfrom parsl.providers import PBSProProvider\n\nThe high throughput executor is for scaling to HPC systems:\n\nfrom parsl.executors import HighThroughputExecutor\n\nYou can use the MPI launcher, but may want the Gnu Parallel launcher, see below\n\nfrom parsl.launchers import MpiExecLauncher, GnuParallelLauncher\n\naddress_by_interface is needed for the HighThroughputExecutor:"

For example, the -cuda flag instructs nvcc to compile .cu input files to .cu.cpp.ii output files which are to be separately compiled, whereas the same -cuda flag instructs nvc, nvc++, and nvfortran to enable CUDA C/C++ or CUDA Fortran code generation. The resulting output file in each case is different (text vs. object) and one may see unrecognized format error when -cuda is incorrectly passed to nvcc.\n\nKnown Issues and Workarounds\n\nIf you are using nvcc to invoke nvc++ and compiling C++17 code, and are seeing the following warning and unable to compile C++17 constructs:\n\n```\npolaris-login-01(~)> nvcc --std=c++17 -ccbin nvc++ ~/smalltests/bool_constant.cpp\nnvcc warning : The -std=c++17 flag is not supported with the configured host compiler.

E.g. if a user submits a script to the prod routing queue requesting 10 nodes for 24 hours, exceeding \"Time Max\" of 6 hrs of the small execution queue (which handles jobs with 10-24 nodes), then it may behave as if the job was never submitted.\n\nJob scripts are copied to temporary locations after qsub and any changes to the original script while the job is queued will not be reflected in the copied script. Furthermore, qalter requires -A <allocation name> when changing job properties. Currently, there is a request for a qalter-like command to trigger a re-copy of the original script to the temporary location.\n\nCompiling & Running Applications\n\nIf your job fails to start with an RPC launch message like below, please forward the complete messages to support@alcf.anl.gov.\n\nbash\n   launch failed on x3104c0s1b0n0: Couldn't forward RPC launch(ab751d77-e80a-4c54-b1c2-4e881f7e8c90) to child x3104c0s31b0n0.hsn.cm.polaris.alcf.anl.gov: Resource temporarily unavailable",

The specification describes directives, runtime routines, and environment variables that allow an application developer to express parallelism (e.g. shared memory multiprocessing and device offloading). Many compiler vendors provide implementations of the OpenMP specification (https://www.openmp.org/specifications).\n\nSetting the environment to use OpenMP on Polaris\n\nMany of the programming environments available on Polaris have OpenMP support.\n\nmodule OpenMP CPU support? OpenMP GPU support?

            "LAMMPS\n\nOverview\n\nLAMMPS is a general-purpose molecular dynamics software package for massively parallel computers. It is written in an exceptionally clean style that makes it one of the more popular codes for users to extend and it currently has dozens of user-developed extensions.\n\nFor details about the code and its usage, see the LAMMPS home page. This page provides information specific to running on Polaris at the ALCF.\n\nUsing LAMMPS at ALCF\n\nALCF provides assistance with build instructions, compiling executables, submitting jobs, and providing prebuilt binaries (upon request). A collection of Makefiles and submission scripts are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo here. For questions, contact us at support@alcf.anl.gov.\n\nHow to Obtain the Code\n\nLAMMPS is an open-source code, which can be downloaded from the LAMMPS website.\n\nBuilding on Polaris\n\nAfter LAMMPS has been downloaded and unpacked on an ALCF filesystem, users should see a directory whose name is of the form lammps-<version>. One should then see the Makefile lammps-<version>/src/MAKE/MACHINES/Makefile.polaris in recent versions that can be used as a starting point for compilation on Polaris. Copies of Makefiles for building with the GPU/KOKKOS package using CUDA for GPU support with the GNU/NVHPC compiler are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo here. For older versions of LAMMPS, you may need to take an existing Makefile (e.g. Makefile.mpi) for your specific version of LAMMPS and edit the top portion appropratiately to create a new Makefile.polaris.\n\nKOKKOS package and GNU compilers\n\nThe following modules are useful for this particular build. Note, the cmake module is not required if using the GNU Makefile procedure to build LAMMPS. The initial module restore is just setting the default environment as the starting point. Users may find it useful to copy these module commands into a small helper script to assist with compiling and running LAMMPS (e.g. setup_lammps_gnu.sh).",

If your build system does require GPUs, you cannot yet compile on the Polaris login nodes, as they do not currently have GPUs installed. You may in this case compile your applications on the Polaris compute nodes. Do this by submitting an interactive single-node job, or running your build system in a batch job.\n\nHome File System\n\nIs it helpful to realize that there is a single HOME filesystem for users that can be accessed from the login and computes of each production resource at ALCF. Thus, users should be mindful of modifications to their environments (e.g. .bashrc) that may cause issues to arise due to differences between the systems.\n\nCray Programming Environment\n\nThe Cray Programming Environment (PE) uses three compiler wrappers for building software. These compiler wrappers should be used when building MPI-enabled applications.\n\ncc - C compiler\n\nCC - C++ compiler\n\nftn - Fortran compiler\n\nEach of these wrappers can select a specific vendor compiler based on the PrgEnv module loaded in the environment. The following are some helpful options to understand what the compiler wrapper is invoking.\n\n--craype-verbose : Print the command which is forwarded to the compiler invocation\n\n--cray-print-opts=libs : Print library information\n\n--cray-print-opts=cflags : Print include information\n\nThe output from these commands may be useful in build scripts where a compiler other than that invoked by a compiler wrapper is desired. Defining some variables as such may prove useful in those situations.\nCRAY_CFLAGS=$(cc --cray-print-opts=cflags)\nCRAY_LIB=$(cc --cray-print-opts=libs)\nFurther documentation and options are available via man cc and similar.\n\nCompilers provided by Cray Programming Environments"

If you prefer to use existing containers, you can pull them from various registries like DockerHub and run them on Polaris.\n\nSince Docker requires root privileges, which users do not have on Polaris, existing Docker containers must be converted to Apptainer.

In this context, it is used to perform General Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) using OneAPI MKL library.\n\n**Step 2: Create an instance of `sycl::queue`**\nAn instance of `sycl::queue` is created with the following line:\n```cpp\nsycl::queue q(sycl::property_list{sycl::property::queue::in_order{}});`\n```\nThis creates a queue that executes kernels in-order, which means that each kernel is executed before the next one starts.\n\n**Step 3: Allocate memory on the device**\nMemory is allocated on the device using `sycl::malloc_device`:\n```cpp\ndouble A_dev         = sycl::malloc_device(MN, q);\ndouble B_dev         = sycl::malloc_device(NP, q);\ndouble C_dev_onemkl = sycl::malloc_device(MP, q);`\n```\nThis memory is used to store the input matrices `A` and `B`, as well as the output matrix `C`.\n\n**Step 4: Copy data from host to device**\nThe data is copied from the host to the device using `q.memcpy`:\n```cpp\nq.memcpy(A_dev, A, (MN) * sizeof(double));\nq.memcpy(B_dev, B, (NP) * sizeof(double));`\n```\nThis copies the input matrices `A` and `B` from the host to the device.\n\n**Step 5: Execute GEMM kernel**\nThe GEMM kernel is executed using OneAPI MKL library:\n```cpp\nauto gemm_event = oneapi::mkl::blas::column_major::gemm(q, transB, transA, n, m, k, alpha, B_dev, ldB, A_dev, ldA, beta, C_dev_onemkl, ldC);`\n```\nThis executes the GEMM kernel on the device using the `sycl::queue` instance.\n\n**Step 6: Copy data from device to host**\nThe output matrix `C` is copied from the device to the host using `q.memcpy`:\n```cpp\nq.memcpy(C_host_onemkl, C_dev_onemkl, (M*P) * sizeof(double));`\n```\nThis copies the output matrix `C` from the device to the host.\n\n**Step 7: Wait for kernel execution**\nThe kernel is waited for using `q.wait()`:\n```cpp\nq.wait();`\n```\nThis ensures that the kernel has completed execution before continuing.\n\nIn summary, the `sycl::queue` class is used to manage and execute OpenCL kernels on a device. It is used in this context to perform GEMM using OneAPI MKL library.\n\n<ANSWER>: The common uses of the `sycl::queue` class in this context are allocating memory on the device, copying data from host to device, executing kernels, and copying data from device to host.",

        "cot_answer": "Here's my step-by-step reasoning to answer the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the context**\nThe context is a CMake configuration file and a Makefile for building a Kokkos application. We can infer that Kokkos is a high-performance computing library.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the relevant information**\nFrom the CMake configuration file, we see that `Kokkos::kokkoscore` is linked to the executable `example1_ sycl_aot`. This suggests that Kokkos is used in this application.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Makefile**\nThe Makefile shows that the compiler flags `-cuda -fopenmp` are set, which implies that Kokkos supports CUDA and OpenMP backends. Additionally, the library `kokkoscore` is linked to the executable, further confirming that Kokkos is used.\n\n**Step 4: Draw conclusions**\nBased on the analysis above, we can conclude that Kokkos is a high-performance computing library used in this application for parallel processing. It supports multiple backends, including CUDA and OpenMP, which enables it to run on various architectures.\n\n**Final answer**\n<ANSWER>: Kokkos is a high-performance computing library used in high-performance computing applications, supporting parallel processing with multiple backends such as CUDA and OpenMP.",

        "question": "What are the minimum requirements for building a Kokkos application, including compiler flags and libraries?",
        "cot_answer": "To determine the minimum requirements for building a Kokkos application, including compiler flags and libraries, we can analyze the given context and additional information.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the CMake configuration**\nThe provided CMake script sets the `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER` to `CC` and `CMAKE_C_COMPILER` to `cc`. This suggests that the default compilers for Kokkos are being used.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the compiler flags**\nIn the Makefile, we see that the `CPPFLAGS` variable is set to `-cuda -fopenmp`, which implies that the CUDA and OpenMP backends are being used. Additionally, the `LDFLAGS` variable is set to `$(CPPFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS)`, indicating that the same flags will be passed to the linker.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the required libraries**\nThe Makefile specifies the following libraries:\n* `-L$(KOKKOS_HOME)/lib64 -lkokkoscore -lkokkossimd -lpthread`\n\nThese libraries are required for building a Kokkos application. Specifically, `kokkoscore` and `kokkossimd` are part of the Kokkos library, while `pthread` is a standard library for threading.\n\n**Step 4: Summarize the minimum requirements**\nBased on the analysis above, the minimum requirements for building a Kokkos application are:\n* Compiler flags: `-cuda -fopenmp`\n* Libraries:\n\t+ `-L$(KOKKOS_HOME)/lib64 -lkokkoscore -lkokkossimd -lpthread`\n\n**Final Answer**\n<ANSWER>: The minimum requirements for building a Kokkos application, including compiler flags and libraries, are: `-cuda -fopenmp` as the compiler flags, and `-L$(KOKKOS_HOME)/lib64 -lkokkoscore -lkokkossimd -lpthread` as the required libraries.",

The relevant line from the CMake configuration is:\n\n`-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=CC`\n\nThis suggests that the `CC` compiler is being used. However, this might not be a standard compiler like GCC or Clang. To determine which compiler is actually being used, I will look at the previous lines in the context.\n\nThe line `module load craype-x86-milan` suggests that we are using a Cray environment, and the line `module load craype-accel-nvidia80` implies that we have an NVIDIA GPU available. This makes me suspect that the compiler being used is likely to be a Cray-specific compiler or a compiler optimized for NVIDIA GPUs.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<ANSWER>: $CC\n\nNote: The actual value of `$CC` might depend on the specific Cray environment and compiler configuration being used.",

If your build system does require GPUs, you cannot yet compile on the Polaris login nodes, as they do not currently have GPUs installed. You may in this case compile your applications on the Polaris compute nodes. Do this by submitting an interactive single-node job, or running your build system in a batch job.\n\nHome File System\n\nIs it helpful to realize that there is a single HOME filesystem for users that can be accessed from the login and computes of each production resource at ALCF. Thus, users should be mindful of modifications to their environments (e.g. .bashrc) that may cause issues to arise due to differences between the systems.\n\nCray Programming Environment\n\nThe Cray Programming Environment (PE) uses three compiler wrappers for building software. These compiler wrappers should be used when building MPI-enabled applications.\n\ncc - C compiler\n\nCC - C++ compiler\n\nftn - Fortran compiler\n\nEach of these wrappers can select a specific vendor compiler based on the PrgEnv module loaded in the environment.

For performance, it will likely be necessary to ensure that each application runs on a distinct set of CPU resources and/or targets specific GPUs. One can provide a list of CPUs using the --cpu-bind option, which when combined with CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES provides a user with specifying exactly which CPU and GPU resources to run each application on. In the example below, four instances of the application are simultaneously running on a single node. In the first instance, the application is spawning MPI ranks 0-7 on CPUs 24-31 and using GPU 0. This mapping is based on output from the nvidia-smi topo -m command and pairs CPUs with the closest GPU.\n\n```bash\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:24:25:26:27:28:29:30:31 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:16:17:18:19:20:21:22:23 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:8:9:10:11:12:13:14:15 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=3\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:0:1:2:3:4:5:6:7 ./hello_affinity &\n\nwait\n```\n\nCompute Node Access to the Internet\n\nCurrently, the only access the internet is via a proxy.

As such, the craype-accel-nvidia80 module is in the default environment. This has the effect of the Cray compiler wrappers adding -gpu to the compiler invocation along with additional include paths and libraries. Additional compilers flags may be needed depending on the compiler and GPU programming model used (e.g. -cuda, -acc, or -mp=gpu).\n\nThis module also adds GPU Transport Layer (GTL) libraries to the link-line to support GPU-aware MPI applications.\n\nMan Pages\n\nFor additional information on the Cray wrappers, please refer to the man pages.\nman cc\nman CC\nman ftn",

If your build system does require GPUs, you cannot yet compile on the Polaris login nodes, as they do not currently have GPUs installed. You may in this case compile your applications on the Polaris compute nodes. Do this by submitting an interactive single-node job, or running your build system in a batch job.\n\nHome File System\n\nIs it helpful to realize that there is a single HOME filesystem for users that can be accessed from the login and computes of each production resource at ALCF. Thus, users should be mindful of modifications to their environments (e.g. .bashrc) that may cause issues to arise due to differences between the systems.\n\nCray Programming Environment\n\nThe Cray Programming Environment (PE) uses three compiler wrappers for building software. These compiler wrappers should be used when building MPI-enabled applications.\n\ncc - C compiler\n\nCC - C++ compiler\n\nftn - Fortran compiler\n\nEach of these wrappers can select a specific vendor compiler based on the PrgEnv module loaded in the environment.

Defining some variables as such may prove useful in those situations.\nCRAY_CFLAGS=$(cc --cray-print-opts=cflags)\nCRAY_LIB=$(cc --cray-print-opts=libs)\nFurther documentation and options are available via man cc and similar.\n\nCompilers provided by Cray Programming Environments"

        "cot_answer": "To determine the number of devices in an OpenMP application, you can use the `omp_get_num_devices()` function. This function returns the total number of devices available to the program.\n\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning on how to answer this question:\n\n1. The first thing to do is to include the OpenMP library in your code. In C++, you would typically include the `<omp.h>` header file, while in Fortran, you would use `use omp_lib`.\n2. Next, you can call the `omp_get_num_devices()` function to get the total number of devices available to the program.\n3. The `omp_get_num_devices()` function returns an integer value representing the total number of devices.\n\n##begin_quote##\nprintf( \"Number of devices: %d\\n\", omp_get_num_devices() );\n##end_quote##\n\nAs you can see in the context, both C and Fortran examples use this function to print out the number of devices available. The output shows that there are 4 devices available.\n\n<ANSWER>: Number of devices: 4",

Note that if you import mpi4py or horovod, and then do something like os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = hvd.local_rank(), it may not actually work!  You must set the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable prior to doing MPI.COMM_WORLD.init(), which is done in horovod.init() as well as implicitly in from mpi4py import MPI.

            "```\n\nSpecial notes for Polaris\n\nOn Polaris, there is a known bug where python applications launched with mpi and that use fork to spawn processes can sometimes have unexplaned hangs.  For this reason, it is recommended to use start_method=\"spawn\" on Polaris when using the MpiExecLauncher as is shown in the example config above.  Alternatively, another solution is to use the GNUParallelLauncher which uses GNU Parallel to spawn processes.  GNU Parallel can be loaded in your environment with the command module load gnu-parallel.  Both of these approaches will circumvent the hang issue from using fork.\n\nUpdates\n\nFor parsl versions after July 2023, the address passed in the HighThroughputExecutor needs to be set to address = address_by_interface(\"bond0\").  With parsl versions prior to July 2023, it was recommended to use address = address_by_hostname() on Polaris, but with later versions this will not work on Polaris (or any other machine)."

        "question": "What is the purpose of the `omp_is_initial_device()` function in OpenMP programming?",
        "cot_answer": "To answer this question, I will provide step-by-step reasoning.\n\nThe `omp_is_initial_device()` function is used to check if the current device is the initial device in OpenMP programming. The initial device is the device that executes the parallel region and spawns other devices as needed.\n\nIn the given context, we can see that the function is being used inside a `#pragma omp target` block. This block is executed on a device, which could be a CPU or an accelerator like a GPU.\n\nThe code checks if the current device is not the initial device using the condition `!omp_is_initial_device()`. If this condition is true, it prints \"Hello world from accelerator.\" Otherwise, it prints \"Hello world from host.\"\n\nThis suggests that the purpose of the `omp_is_initial_device()` function in OpenMP programming is to determine whether the current device is the initial device or not. This can be useful in situations where you want to execute different code on the initial device compared to other devices.\n\nFinal Answer: <ANSWER>: The purpose of the `omp_is_initial_device()` function in OpenMP programming is to determine whether the current device is the initial device or not, allowing for execution of different code on the initial device compared to other devices.",
