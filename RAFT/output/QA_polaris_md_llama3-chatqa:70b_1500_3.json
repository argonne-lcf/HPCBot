Existing binaries are unlikely to run successfully.\n\nWe have held all jobs submitted prior to the upgrade as a user hold. Users may release their existing jobs with qrls to run after they have rebuilt their binaries.\n\nPBS does cache the job execution script.  If a change to the script is required due to a path changing post rebuild, the job will have to be resubmitted.\n\nAll application binaries should be rebuilt prior to further job submissions.\n\nRe-building user codes\n\nMany user codes will need to be re-built and/or re-linked against the newer version of the programming environment (23.12) and Spack provided dependencies.\n\nChanges to the user software environment",

            "Use XLA compilation on your code.  XLA is the Accelerated Linear Algebra library that is available in tensorFlow and critical in software like JAX.  XLA will compile a tf.Graph object, generated with tf.function or similar, and perform optimizations like operation-fusion.  XLA can give impressive performance boosts with almost no user changes except to set an environment variable TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2.  If your code is complex, or has dynamically sized tensors (tensors where the shape changes every iteration), XLA can be detrimental: the overhead for compiling functions can be large enough to mitigate performance improvements.  XLA is particularly powerful when combined with reduced precision, yielding speedups > 100% in some models.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nTensorFlow is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with tensorFlow has been seen with horovod in particular.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation.  Some polaris specific details that may be helpful to you:\n\nCPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.

Determine what these variables are used for based on their names and values.\n\nReasoning:\nThe context sets several proxy-related environment variables. The HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY variables are likely used to specify a proxy server for HTTP and HTTPS requests, respectively. This is supported by the fact that they have similar names and values, with \"http\" or \"https\" as the protocol prefix.\n\n##begin_quote##\nexport HTTP_PROXY=\"http://proxy.alcf.anl.gov:3128\"\nexport HTTPS_PROXY=\"http://proxy.alcf.anl.gov:3128\"\n##end_quote##\n\nThe http_proxy and https_proxy variables are likely aliases for the same values, allowing users to access these settings using different variable names. The ftp_proxy variable is also set to the same value as the HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY variables, suggesting that it may be used for FTP requests.\n\nIn summary, the HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY variables are used to specify a proxy server for HTTP and HTTPS requests, respectively.\n\n<ANSWER>: The HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY variables are used to specify a proxy server for HTTP and HTTPS requests.",

It works with multiple devices (backends) using device-specific libraries underneath.\n\noneMKL is part of oneAPI. Various backend supported are shown below. More Information here.\n\nUser Application Third-Party Library cuBLAS oneMKL interface cuSOLVER cuRAND\n\nExample (using onemkl::gemm)\n\nThe following snippet shows how to compile and run a SYCL code with oneMKL library.

            "Use XLA compilation on your code.  XLA is the Accelerated Linear Algebra library that is available in tensorFlow and critical in software like JAX.  XLA will compile a tf.Graph object, generated with tf.function or similar, and perform optimizations like operation-fusion.  XLA can give impressive performance boosts with almost no user changes except to set an environment variable TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2.  If your code is complex, or has dynamically sized tensors (tensors where the shape changes every iteration), XLA can be detrimental: the overhead for compiling functions can be large enough to mitigate performance improvements.  XLA is particularly powerful when combined with reduced precision, yielding speedups > 100% in some models.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nTensorFlow is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with tensorFlow has been seen with horovod in particular.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation.  Some polaris specific details that may be helpful to you:\n\nCPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.

Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with TensorFlow operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the tf.keras.mixed_precision Policy, as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  If you use a custom training loop (and not keras.Model.fit), you will also need to apply loss scaling.\n\nUse TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.  Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.  When possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention."

JAX is built on XLA (the same XLA TensorFlow uses) as well as AutoGrad, and additionally has acceleration tools that operate on functions such as vmap, jit, etc.  JAX is not as widespread in machine learning as TensorFlow and PyTorch for traditional models (Computer Vision, Language Models) though it is quickly gaining promienence.  JAX is very powerful when a program needs non-traditional autodifferentiation or vectorizatoin, such as: forward-mode AD, higher order derivatives, Jacobians, Hessians, or any combination of the above.  Users of JAX on Polaris are encouraged to read the user documentation in detail, particularly the details about pure-functional programming, no in-place operations, and the common mistakes in writing functions for the @jit decorator.\n\nJAX on Polaris\n\nJAX is installed on Polaris via the conda module, available with:\nbash\nmodule load conda; conda activate\n\nThen, you can load JAX in python as usual (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):\n\n```python\n\nimport jax\njax.version\n'0.3.15'\n\n```\n\nNotes on JAX 0.3.15\n\nOn Polaris, due to a bug, an environment variable must be set to use JAX on GPUs.

Set Up Servers (first time only)\n\nThe first time you want to run a server on Polaris and have it connect to your local ParaView client, you will need to set up a Server. Once this server is set up, you can reuse it each time you run the ParaView client with the ParaView server on Polaris.\n\nKitware, the developers of ParaView, maintain a database of server configurations which you can retrieve through the ParaView client. In the File->Connect menu press the button named \"Fetch Servers\" and select POLARIS@ANL. Windows users should select \"windows to POLARIS@ANL\". Press \"Import Selected\"\n\n3. Use ParaView\n\nAfter the previous step, you can now select POLARIS@ANL in the File->Connect menu and press Connect\n\nAt this point a new window will pop up\n\nThere are a number of parameters that you must enter manually here:\n\nXterm executable: the path of a terminal on your system. The figure shows the case of a Mac with XQuartz. You may need to change these values for Windows or Linux.\n\nSSH executable: the name of your ssh command. It may be different on Windows depending on the ssh client installed (i.e putty)\n\nRemote machine: leave this value at polaris.alcf.anl.gov\n\nUsername: your ALCF user name\n\nParaView version: the version of Paraview that you want to use.

The ParaView client needs to first be installed on your local resource, and needs to match the version that you run on Polaris.\n\nThere are multiple versions of ParaView installed on Polaris. To find the versions of ParaView currently available on Polaris run the following command on a login node: \nmodule use /soft/modulefiles\nmodule avail paraview\n\nBinary and source packages of the ParaView client for Linux, MacOS, and Windows are available from the ParaView Download Page.\n\nConnecting to the ParaView server on Polaris\n\nThis section describes how to launch the ParaView server on Polaris from a local ParaView client.\n\nStart ParaView Client\n\nFirst, launch the ParaView client on your local resource.

This enables developers to debug applications without the potential variations introduced by simulation and emulation environments.\n\nStep-by-step guide\n\nDebug Compilation\n\nNVCC, the NVIDIA CUDA compiler driver, provides a mechanism for generating the debugging information necessary for CUDA-GDB to work properly. The -g -G option pair must be passed to NVCC when an application is compiled for ease of debugging with CUDA-GDB; for example,\nnvcc -g -G foo.cu -o foo\nUsing this line to compile the CUDA application foo.cu\n* forces -O0 compilation, with the exception of very limited dead-code eliminations and register-spilling optimizations.\n* makes the compiler include debug information in the executable\n\nRunning CUDA-gdb on Polaris compute nodes\n\nStart an interactive job mode on Polaris as follows:\n\n```\n$ qsub -I -l select=1 -l walltime=1:00:00"

Within the context, there are mentions of other packages such as \"xalt\" and \"gsl\", but no direct information about gnu-parallel's purpose.\n\nHowever, by examining the package names, I can make an educated guess. The presence of \"gnu-\" in the name suggests that it might be related to GNU (GNU's Not Unix), a popular open-source operating system. Additionally, the word \"parallel\" implies that gnu-parallel might be related to processing or executing tasks concurrently.\n\nBased on this reasoning, I will provide my answer:\n\n<ANSWER>: gnu-parallel is likely a software package or library for parallel processing or task execution.",

However, there is no explicit information about compatibility between these versions.\n\nTo answer the question, let's consider the general principles of software versioning. Typically, a newer version of software is designed to be backward compatible with older versions, meaning it can run on systems that have the older version installed. However, this is not always the case, and some updates may introduce changes that are not compatible with previous versions.\n\nBased on the available information, we cannot definitively say whether xalt version 3.0.1-20230815 is compatible with other versions of xalt. The compatibility would depend on various factors such as the specific changes made in each version and how they affect the software's functionality.\n\n<ANSWER>: Unknown",

            "TensorFlow Best Practices on Polaris\n\nSingle Node Performance\n\nWhen running TensorFlow applications, we have found the following practices to be generally, if not universally, useful and encourage you to try some of these techniques to boost performance of your own applications.\n\nUse Reduced Precision. Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with TensorFlow operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the tf.keras.mixed_precision Policy, as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  If you use a custom training loop (and not keras.Model.fit), you will also need to apply loss scaling.\n\nUse TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.  Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.  When possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention.",

Note that if you import mpi4py or horovod, and then do something like os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = hvd.local_rank(), it may not actually work!  You must set the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable prior to doing MPI.COMM_WORLD.init(), which is done in horovod.init() as well as implicitly in from mpi4py import MPI.   On Polaris specifically, you can use the environment variable PMI_LOCAL_RANK (as well as PMI_LOCAL_SIZE) to learn information about the node-local MPI ranks.\n\nTensorFlow Dataloaders\n\nAdditional information to be provided.",

        "cot_answer": "Here's my step-by-step reasoning to answer the question:\n\nTo determine why users might see error messages indicating abnormal process termination when running user processes on login nodes, I'll first identify the relevant information in the context. The key phrase that stands out is \"Memory limits were lowered on the logins due to resource contention to 8GB of memory, and 8 cores per user.\"\n\n##begin_quote##\nMemory limits were lowered on the logins due to resource contention to 8GB of memory, and 8 cores per user.\n##end_quote##\n\nThis suggests that there is a limit on the amount of memory and CPU resources available to each user. This could potentially cause issues with processes that require more resources than what's allocated.\n\nThe error messages mentioned in the context, such as \"nvcc error: 'cudafe++' died due to signal 9 (Kill signal)\" and \"g++-12: fatal error: Killed signal terminated program cc1plus\", are likely related to this resource limitation. These errors indicate that a process was terminated abnormally due to exceeding the allocated resources.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that users might see error messages indicating abnormal process termination when running user processes on login nodes because of the memory and CPU limits imposed by the system.\n\n<ANSWER>: The users might see error messages indicating abnormal process termination when running user processes on login nodes because of the memory and CPU limits imposed by the system.",

If you prefer to use existing containers, you can pull them from various registries like DockerHub and run them on Polaris.\n\nSince Docker requires root privileges, which users do not have on Polaris, existing Docker containers must be converted to Apptainer.

Identify the relevant information from the context that might help answer the question.\n\nFrom the context, I see that there are six execution queues (small, medium, large, backfill-small, backfill-medium, and backfill-large) with different node counts and time limits. Additionally, there is a recommendation to submit jobs with a maximum node count of 476-486 nodes due to current rates of downed nodes.\n\n2. Analyze the context information to determine if it provides any guidance on the recommended maximum node count for submitting jobs to avoid sitting in the queue indefinitely.\n\nThe context mentions that larger jobs may sit in the queue indefinitely, and there is a recommendation to submit jobs with a maximum node count of 476-486 nodes. This suggests that jobs with more than 476-486 nodes might not be executed promptly due to downed nodes.\n\n3. Based on the analysis, provide a step-by-step reasoning for answering the question.\n\n##begin_quote##\nIf there are free nodes in production, then debug jobs can take another 16 nodes for a total of 24.\nprod is routing queue and routes your job to one of the following six execution queues:\n...\nNote 4: As of January 20, 2023, it is recommended to submit jobs with a maximum node count of 476-486 nodes given current rates of downed nodes (larger jobs may sit in the queue indefinitely).\n##end_quote##\n\nFrom this information, I can infer that submitting jobs with more than 476-486 nodes might lead to them sitting in the queue indefinitely.

In this case, it will be important to have the craype-accel-nvidia80 module loaded both when compiling your application and during runtime to correctly link against a GPU Transport Layer (GTL) MPI library. Otherwise, you'll likely see GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED is requested, but GTL library is not linked errors during runtime.\n- If running on a specific GPU or subset of GPUs is desired, then the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable can be used. For example, if one only wanted an application to access the first two GPUs on a node, then setting CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 could be used.\n\nBinding MPI ranks to GPUs\n\nThe Cray MPI on Polaris does not currently support binding MPI ranks to GPUs. For applications that need this support, this instead can be handled by use of a small helper script that will appropriately set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES for each MPI rank. One example is available here where each MPI rank is similarly bound to a single GPU with round-robin assignment.\n\nA example set_affinity_gpu_polaris.sh script follows where GPUs are assigned round-robin to MPI ranks.\n\n```bash\n\n!/bin/bash -l\n\nnum_gpus=4\n\nneed to assign GPUs in reverse order due to topology",

The ParaView client needs to first be installed on your local resource, and needs to match the version that you run on Polaris.\n\nThere are multiple versions of ParaView installed on Polaris. To find the versions of ParaView currently available on Polaris run the following command on a login node: \nmodule use /soft/modulefiles\nmodule avail paraview\n\nBinary and source packages of the ParaView client for Linux, MacOS, and Windows are available from the ParaView Download Page.\n\nConnecting to the ParaView server on Polaris\n\nThis section describes how to launch the ParaView server on Polaris from a local ParaView client.\n\nStart ParaView Client\n\nFirst, launch the ParaView client on your local resource.

If you wanted everything in the same dragonfly group, replace tier0 with tier1.  Note that you have to also explicitly specify the place when you use group.

In particular, we encourage users to try their scaling measurements with the following settings:\n\nSet the environment variable NCCL_COLLNET_ENABLE=1\n\nSet the environment varialbe NCCL_NET_GDR_LEVEL=PHB\n\nManually set the CPU affinity via mpiexec, such as with --cpu-bind verbose,list:0,8,16,24\n\nHorovod and DDP work best when you limit the visible devices to only one GPU.  Note that if you import mpi4py or horovod, and then do something like os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = hvd.local_rank(), it may not actually work!  You must set the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable prior to doing MPI.COMM_WORLD.init(), which is done in horovod.init() as well as implicitly in from mpi4py import MPI.   On Polaris specifically, you can use the environment variable PMI_LOCAL_RANK (as well as PMI_LOCAL_SIZE) to learn information about the node-local MPI ranks.\n\nDeepSpeed\n\nDeepSpeed is also available and usable on Polaris.  For more information, please see the DeepSpeed documentation directly.\n\nPyTorch DataLoader and multi-node Horovod\n\nPlease note there is a bug that causes a hang when using PyTorch's multithreaded data loaders with distributed training across multiple nodes.

            "Running GPU-enabled Applications\n\nGPU-enabled applications will similarly run on the compute nodes using the above example script.\n- The environment variable MPICH_GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED=1 needs to be set if your application requires MPI-GPU support whereby the MPI library sends and receives data directly from GPU buffers. In this case, it will be important to have the craype-accel-nvidia80 module loaded both when compiling your application and during runtime to correctly link against a GPU Transport Layer (GTL) MPI library. Otherwise, you'll likely see GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED is requested, but GTL library is not linked errors during runtime.\n- If running on a specific GPU or subset of GPUs is desired, then the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable can be used. For example, if one only wanted an application to access the first two GPUs on a node, then setting CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 could be used.\n\nBinding MPI ranks to GPUs\n\nThe Cray MPI on Polaris does not currently support binding MPI ranks to GPUs. For applications that need this support, this instead can be handled by use of a small helper script that will appropriately set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES for each MPI rank. One example is available here where each MPI rank is similarly bound to a single GPU with round-robin assignment.\n\nA example set_affinity_gpu_polaris.sh script follows where GPUs are assigned round-robin to MPI ranks.\n\n```bash\n\n!/bin/bash -l\n\nnum_gpus=4\n\nneed to assign GPUs in reverse order due to topology",

E.g. if a user submits a script to the prod routing queue requesting 10 nodes for 24 hours, exceeding \"Time Max\" of 6 hrs of the small execution queue (which handles jobs with 10-24 nodes), then it may behave as if the job was never submitted.\n\nJob scripts are copied to temporary locations after qsub and any changes to the original script while the job is queued will not be reflected in the copied script. Furthermore, qalter requires -A <allocation name> when changing job properties. Currently, there is a request for a qalter-like command to trigger a re-copy of the original script to the temporary location.\n\nCompiling & Running Applications\n\nIf your job fails to start with an RPC launch message like below, please forward the complete messages to support@alcf.anl.gov.",

The context provides some known issues related to submitting jobs and compiling/runnning applications.\n\nOne possible reason for the job failure is that the parameters in the submission script do not meet the parameters of any execution queue. According to the context, if the user submits a script to the prod routing queue requesting 10 nodes for 24 hours, exceeding \"Time Max\" of 6 hrs of the small execution queue, then it may behave as if the job was never submitted.\n\nAnother possible reason is that the job script is copied to temporary locations after qsub and any changes to the original script while the job is queued will not be reflected in the copied script. This could cause issues with the job starting or running correctly.\n\n##begin_quote##\nIf your job fails to start with an RPC launch message like below, please forward the complete messages to support@alcf.anl.gov.\n##end_quote##\n\nBased on these possible reasons, we can conclude that the job failure is likely due to a mismatch between the submission script parameters and the execution queue parameters or changes made to the original script after qsub.\n\n<ANSWER>: The job fails to start with an RPC launch message because of a mismatch between the submission script parameters and the execution queue parameters or changes made to the original script after qsub.",

            "Running GPU-enabled Applications\n\nGPU-enabled applications will similarly run on the compute nodes using the above example script.\n- The environment variable MPICH_GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED=1 needs to be set if your application requires MPI-GPU support whereby the MPI library sends and receives data directly from GPU buffers. In this case, it will be important to have the craype-accel-nvidia80 module loaded both when compiling your application and during runtime to correctly link against a GPU Transport Layer (GTL) MPI library. Otherwise, you'll likely see GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED is requested, but GTL library is not linked errors during runtime.\n- If running on a specific GPU or subset of GPUs is desired, then the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable can be used. For example, if one only wanted an application to access the first two GPUs on a node, then setting CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 could be used.\n\nBinding MPI ranks to GPUs\n\nThe Cray MPI on Polaris does not currently support binding MPI ranks to GPUs. For applications that need this support, this instead can be handled by use of a small helper script that will appropriately set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES for each MPI rank. One example is available here where each MPI rank is similarly bound to a single GPU with round-robin assignment.\n\nA example set_affinity_gpu_polaris.sh script follows where GPUs are assigned round-robin to MPI ranks.\n\n```bash\n\n!/bin/bash -l\n\nnum_gpus=4\n\nneed to assign GPUs in reverse order due to topology",

            "TensorFlow Best Practices on Polaris\n\nSingle Node Performance\n\nWhen running TensorFlow applications, we have found the following practices to be generally, if not universally, useful and encourage you to try some of these techniques to boost performance of your own applications.\n\nUse Reduced Precision. Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with TensorFlow operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the tf.keras.mixed_precision Policy, as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  If you use a custom training loop (and not keras.Model.fit), you will also need to apply loss scaling.\n\nUse TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.  Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.

This guide details the use of containers on Polaris, including custom container creation, large-scale execution, and common pitfalls.\n\nApptainer Setup\n\nPolaris employs Apptainer (formerly known as Singularity) for container management. To set up Apptainer, run:\n\nbash\nmodule use /soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/install/modulefiles/Core\nmodule load apptainer\napptainer version #1.2.2\n\nThe Apptainer version on Polaris is 1.2.2. Detailed user documentation is available here\n\nBuilding from Docker or Argonne GitHub Container Registry\n\nContainers on Polaris can be built by writing Dockerfiles on a local machine and then publish the container to DockerHub, or by directly building them on ALCF compute node by writing an Apptainer recipe file. If you prefer to use existing containers, you can pull them from various registries like DockerHub and run them on Polaris.\n\nSince Docker requires root privileges, which users do not have on Polaris, existing Docker containers must be converted to Apptainer. To build a Docker-based container on Polaris, use the following as an example:",

Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with TensorFlow operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the tf.keras.mixed_precision Policy, as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  If you use a custom training loop (and not keras.Model.fit), you will also need to apply loss scaling.\n\nUse TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.  Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.  When possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention.",

For this reason, it is recommended to use start_method=\"spawn\" on Polaris when using the MpiExecLauncher as is shown in the example config above.  Alternatively, another solution is to use the GNUParallelLauncher which uses GNU Parallel to spawn processes.  GNU Parallel can be loaded in your environment with the command module load gnu-parallel.  Both of these approaches will circumvent the hang issue from using fork.\n\nUpdates\n\nFor parsl versions after July 2023, the address passed in the HighThroughputExecutor needs to be set to address = address_by_interface(\"bond0\").  With parsl versions prior to July 2023, it was recommended to use address = address_by_hostname() on Polaris, but with later versions this will not work on Polaris (or any other machine)."

Analyze the provided example job script, which appears to be a PBS job script.\n\nThe script specifies the following:\n\n* `PBS -l select=1:system=polaris`: This line requests a single node from the Polaris system.\n* `PBS -l place=scatter`: This line specifies that the job should be placed on the nodes in a scattered manner, which implies that each MPI rank will be bound to a specific host CPU.\n* `MPI example w/ 16 MPI ranks per node spread evenly across cores`: This line suggests that the job is intended to run with multiple MPI ranks, and that each rank will be bound to a specific core on the host CPU.\n\n3. Based on this analysis, I can conclude that the purpose of binding MPI ranks and OpenMP threads to the host CPU as intended in a job script on Polaris is to ensure that each MPI rank is executed on a specific host CPU, which is achieved by using the `place=scatter` option in the PBS job script.\n\n<ANSWER>: The purpose of binding MPI ranks and OpenMP threads to the host CPU as intended in a job script on Polaris is to ensure that each MPI rank is executed on a specific host CPU.",

A Balsam Site runs on a node with access to the job scheduler, where it can submit and monitor jobs. Overall job state is aggregated on the Balsam Server, making job data from all Sites accessible from any individual site (or the user's laptop), via the command-line interface or the Python API. To get information on how to use the command line tool, you can type balsam --help in your shell.\n\nFull documentation for Balsam is available online.\n\nBalsam requires Python 3.7+. To install Balsam on Polaris, first set up a virtual Python environment:\n\nshell\nmodule load conda\nconda activate base\npython -m venv env\nsource env/bin/activate\npip install --upgrade pip\npip install --pre balsam\n\nTo use Balsam, users need an account on the Balsam server.  Users can get an account by contacting the ALCF Help Desk.  Once a user has an account, they can login and make a new site.  A Balsam site is a project space for your workflow.

To use it from a compute node, please do:\n\nbash\nmodule load conda\nconda activate\n\nThen, you can load PyTorch in python as usual (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):\n\n```python\n\nimport torch\ntorch.version\n'1.12.0a0+git67ece03'\n\n```\n\nThis installation of PyTorch was built from source and the cuda libraries it uses are found via the CUDA_HOME environment variable (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):\n\nbash\n$ echo $CUDA_HOME\n/soft/datascience/cuda/cuda_11.5.2_495.29.05_linux\n\nIf you need to build applications that use this version of PyTorch and CUDA, we recommend using these cuda libraries to ensure compatibility.  We periodically update the PyTorch release, though updates will come in the form of new versions of the conda module.\n\nPyTorch is also available through nvidia containers that have been translated to Singularity containers.

            "Running GPU-enabled Applications\n\nGPU-enabled applications will similarly run on the compute nodes using the above example script.\n- The environment variable MPICH_GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED=1 needs to be set if your application requires MPI-GPU support whereby the MPI library sends and receives data directly from GPU buffers. In this case, it will be important to have the craype-accel-nvidia80 module loaded both when compiling your application and during runtime to correctly link against a GPU Transport Layer (GTL) MPI library. Otherwise, you'll likely see GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED is requested, but GTL library is not linked errors during runtime.\n- If running on a specific GPU or subset of GPUs is desired, then the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable can be used. For example, if one only wanted an application to access the first two GPUs on a node, then setting CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 could be used.\n\nBinding MPI ranks to GPUs\n\nThe Cray MPI on Polaris does not currently support binding MPI ranks to GPUs. For applications that need this support, this instead can be handled by use of a small helper script that will appropriately set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES for each MPI rank. One example is available here where each MPI rank is similarly bound to a single GPU with round-robin assignment.\n\nA example set_affinity_gpu_polaris.sh script follows where GPUs are assigned round-robin to MPI ranks.\n\n```bash\n\n!/bin/bash -l\n\nnum_gpus=4\n\nneed to assign GPUs in reverse order due to topology",

Do this by submitting an interactive single-node job, or running your build system in a batch job.\n\nHome File System\n\nIs it helpful to realize that there is a single HOME filesystem for users that can be accessed from the login and computes of each production resource at ALCF. Thus, users should be mindful of modifications to their environments (e.g. .bashrc) that may cause issues to arise due to differences between the systems.\n\nCray Programming Environment\n\nThe Cray Programming Environment (PE) uses three compiler wrappers for building software. These compiler wrappers should be used when building MPI-enabled applications.\n\ncc - C compiler\n\nCC - C++ compiler\n\nftn - Fortran compiler\n\nEach of these wrappers can select a specific vendor compiler based on the PrgEnv module loaded in the environment. The following are some helpful options to understand what the compiler wrapper is invoking.\n\n--craype-verbose : Print the command which is forwarded to the compiler invocation",

            "Example Programs and Makefiles for Polaris\n\nSeveral simple examples of building CPU and GPU-enabled codes on Polaris are available in the ALCF GettingStart repo for several programming models. If build your application is problematic for some reason (e.g. absence of a GPU), then users are encouraged to build and test applications directly on one of the Polaris compute nodes via an interactive job. The discussion below makes use of the NVHPC compilers in the default environment as illustrative examples. Similar examples for other compilers on Polaris are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo.\n\nCPU MPI+OpenMP Example\n\nOne of the first useful tasks with any new machine, scheduler, and job launcher is to ensure one is binding MPI ranks and OpenMP threads to the host cpu as intended. A simple HelloWorld MPI+OpenMP example is available here to get started with.\n\nThe application can be straightforwardly compiled using the Cray compiler wrappers.\nCC -fopenmp main.cpp -o hello_affinity\n\nThe executable hello_affinity can then be launched in a job script (or directly in shell of interactive job) using mpiexec as discussed here.\n\n```\n\n!/bin/sh\n\nPBS -l select=1:system=polaris\n\nPBS -l place=scatter\n\nPBS -l walltime=0:30:00\n\nPBS -l filesystems=home\n\nMPI example w/ 16 MPI ranks per node spread evenly across cores\n\nNNODES=wc -l < $PBS_NODEFILE\nNRANKS_PER_NODE=16\nNDEPTH=4\nNTHREADS=1",
            "Known Issues\n\nThis is a collection of known issues that have been encountered on Polaris. Documentation will be updated as issues are resolved. Users are encouraged to email support@alcf.anl.gov to report issues.\n\nSubmitting Jobs\n\nFor batch job submissions, if the parameters within your submission script do not meet the parameters of any of the execution queues (small, ..., backfill-large) you might not receive the \"Job submission\" error on the command line at all, and the job will never appear in history qstat -xu <username> (current bug in PBS). E.g. if a user submits a script to the prod routing queue requesting 10 nodes for 24 hours, exceeding \"Time Max\" of 6 hrs of the small execution queue (which handles jobs with 10-24 nodes), then it may behave as if the job was never submitted.\n\nJob scripts are copied to temporary locations after qsub and any changes to the original script while the job is queued will not be reflected in the copied script. Furthermore, qalter requires -A <allocation name> when changing job properties. Currently, there is a request for a qalter-like command to trigger a re-copy of the original script to the temporary location.\n\nCompiling & Running Applications\n\nIf your job fails to start with an RPC launch message like below, please forward the complete messages to support@alcf.anl.gov.",

According to the context, this module is in the default environment and adds -gpu to the compiler invocation along with additional include paths and libraries. This suggests that the module prepares the compilation environment for GPU-based programming.\n\nAdditionally, the context mentions that the module also adds GPU Transport Layer (GTL) libraries to the link-line. This implies that the GTL libraries are essential for supporting GPU-aware MPI applications.\n\n##begin_quote##\nIt is assumed the majority of applications to be built on Polaris will make use of the GPUs. As such, the craype-accel-nvidia80 module is in the default environment. This has the effect of the Cray compiler wrappers adding -gpu to the compiler invocation along with additional include paths and libraries.\n##end_quote##\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can conclude that the craype-accel-nvidia80 module supports GPU-aware MPI applications by:\n\n1. Preparing the compilation environment for GPU-based programming through the addition of -gpu and other necessary flags.\n2.

For instance, if only your head node needed public access your select statement might looks something like: -l select=1:pubnet=True+63.\n\nControlling Where Your Job Runs\n\nIf you wish to have your job run on specific nodes form your select like this: -l select=1:vnode=<node name1>+1:vnode=<node name2>... . Obviously, that gets tedious for large jobs.\n\nIf you want to control the location of a few nodes, for example 2 out of 64, but the rest don't matter, you can do something like this: -l select=1:vnode=<node name1>+1:vnode=<node name2>+62:system=foo\n\nEvery node has a PBS resource called tier0 with a rack identifier and tier1 with a dragonfly group identifieer.  If you want all your nodes grouped in a rack, you can add the group specifier -l select=8:system=foo,place=scatter:group=tier0.  If you wanted everything in the same dragonfly group, replace tier0 with tier1.  Note that you have to also explicitly specify the place when you use group.  If you wanted a specific rack or dragonfly group instead of any of them, you are back to the select: -l select 10:tier0=x3001-g0.\n\nNetwork: Rack and Dragonfly Group Mappings",

Developers can optimize bottlenecks to scale efficiently across any number or size of CPUs and GPUs on Polaris. For further optimizations to compute kernels developers should use Nsight Compute.\n\nThe NVIDIA Nsight Compute is an interactive kernel profiler for CUDA applications. It provides detailed performance metrics and API debugging via a user interface and command line tool.\n\nIn addition, the baseline feature of this tool allows users to compare results within the tool. NVIDIA Nsight Compute provides a customizable and data-driven user interface,  metric collection, and can be extended with analysis scripts for post-processing results.\n\nStep-by-step guide\n\nCommon part on Polaris\n\nBuild your application for Polaris, and then submit your job script to Polaris or start an interactive job mode on Polaris as follows:\n\n```\n$ qsub -I -l select=1 -l walltime=1:00:00 -l filesystems=home:eagle -q debug -A\n\n$ module li\n\nCurrently Loaded Modules:\n  1) nvhpc/23.9          5) cray-pmi/6.1.13      9) PrgEnv-nvhpc/8.5.0      13) darshan/3.4.4\n  2) craype/2.7.30       6) cray-pals/1.3.4     10) libfabric/1.15.2.0\n  3) cray-dsmml/0.2.2    7) cray-libpals/1.3.4  11) craype-network-ofi\n  4) cray-mpich/8.1.28   8) craype-x86-milan    12) perftools-base/23.12.0",
            "Compiling and Linking Overview on Polaris\n\nCompiling on Polaris Login and Compute Nodes\n\nIf your build system does not require GPUs for the build process, as is usually the case, compilation of GPU-accelerated codes is generally expected to work well on the Polaris login nodes. If your build system does require GPUs, you cannot yet compile on the Polaris login nodes, as they do not currently have GPUs installed. You may in this case compile your applications on the Polaris compute nodes. Do this by submitting an interactive single-node job, or running your build system in a batch job.\n\nHome File System\n\nIs it helpful to realize that there is a single HOME filesystem for users that can be accessed from the login and computes of each production resource at ALCF. Thus, users should be mindful of modifications to their environments (e.g. .bashrc) that may cause issues to arise due to differences between the systems.\n\nCray Programming Environment\n\nThe Cray Programming Environment (PE) uses three compiler wrappers for building software. These compiler wrappers should be used when building MPI-enabled applications.\n\ncc - C compiler\n\nCC - C++ compiler\n\nftn - Fortran compiler\n\nEach of these wrappers can select a specific vendor compiler based on the PrgEnv module loaded in the environment. The following are some helpful options to understand what the compiler wrapper is invoking.\n\n--craype-verbose : Print the command which is forwarded to the compiler invocation",

In this case, it will be important to have the craype-accel-nvidia80 module loaded both when compiling your application and during runtime to correctly link against a GPU Transport Layer (GTL) MPI library. Otherwise, you'll likely see GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED is requested, but GTL library is not linked errors during runtime.\n- If running on a specific GPU or subset of GPUs is desired, then the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable can be used. For example, if one only wanted an application to access the first two GPUs on a node, then setting CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 could be used.\n\nBinding MPI ranks to GPUs\n\nThe Cray MPI on Polaris does not currently support binding MPI ranks to GPUs. For applications that need this support, this instead can be handled by use of a small helper script that will appropriately set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES for each MPI rank. One example is available here where each MPI rank is similarly bound to a single GPU with round-robin assignment.\n\nA example set_affinity_gpu_polaris.sh script follows where GPUs are assigned round-robin to MPI ranks.\n\n```bash\n\n!/bin/bash -l\n\nnum_gpus=4\n\nneed to assign GPUs in reverse order due to topology",

If your build system does require GPUs, you cannot yet compile on the Polaris login nodes, as they do not currently have GPUs installed. You may in this case compile your applications on the Polaris compute nodes. Do this by submitting an interactive single-node job, or running your build system in a batch job.\n\nHome File System\n\nIs it helpful to realize that there is a single HOME filesystem for users that can be accessed from the login and computes of each production resource at ALCF. Thus, users should be mindful of modifications to their environments (e.g. .bashrc) that may cause issues to arise due to differences between the systems.\n\nCray Programming Environment\n\nThe Cray Programming Environment (PE) uses three compiler wrappers for building software.

            "Compiling and Linking Overview on Polaris\n\nCompiling on Polaris Login and Compute Nodes\n\nIf your build system does not require GPUs for the build process, as is usually the case, compilation of GPU-accelerated codes is generally expected to work well on the Polaris login nodes. If your build system does require GPUs, you cannot yet compile on the Polaris login nodes, as they do not currently have GPUs installed. You may in this case compile your applications on the Polaris compute nodes. Do this by submitting an interactive single-node job, or running your build system in a batch job.\n\nHome File System\n\nIs it helpful to realize that there is a single HOME filesystem for users that can be accessed from the login and computes of each production resource at ALCF. Thus, users should be mindful of modifications to their environments (e.g. .bashrc) that may cause issues to arise due to differences between the systems.\n\nCray Programming Environment\n\nThe Cray Programming Environment (PE) uses three compiler wrappers for building software. These compiler wrappers should be used when building MPI-enabled applications.\n\ncc - C compiler\n\nCC - C++ compiler\n\nftn - Fortran compiler\n\nEach of these wrappers can select a specific vendor compiler based on the PrgEnv module loaded in the environment. The following are some helpful options to understand what the compiler wrapper is invoking.\n\n--craype-verbose : Print the command which is forwarded to the compiler invocation",

            "TensorFlow Best Practices on Polaris\n\nSingle Node Performance\n\nWhen running TensorFlow applications, we have found the following practices to be generally, if not universally, useful and encourage you to try some of these techniques to boost performance of your own applications.\n\nUse Reduced Precision. Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with TensorFlow operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the tf.keras.mixed_precision Policy, as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  If you use a custom training loop (and not keras.Model.fit), you will also need to apply loss scaling.\n\nUse TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.  Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.  When possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention.",

Do this by submitting an interactive single-node job, or running your build system in a batch job.\n\nHome File System\n\nIs it helpful to realize that there is a single HOME filesystem for users that can be accessed from the login and computes of each production resource at ALCF. Thus, users should be mindful of modifications to their environments (e.g. .bashrc) that may cause issues to arise due to differences between the systems.\n\nCray Programming Environment\n\nThe Cray Programming Environment (PE) uses three compiler wrappers for building software. These compiler wrappers should be used when building MPI-enabled applications.\n\ncc - C compiler\n\nCC - C++ compiler\n\nftn - Fortran compiler\n\nEach of these wrappers can select a specific vendor compiler based on the PrgEnv module loaded in the environment.

It provides detailed performance metrics and API debugging via a user interface and command line tool.\n\nIn addition, the baseline feature of this tool allows users to compare results within the tool. NVIDIA Nsight Compute provides a customizable and data-driven user interface,  metric collection, and can be extended with analysis scripts for post-processing results.\n\nStep-by-step guide\n\nCommon part on Polaris\n\nBuild your application for Polaris, and then submit your job script to Polaris or start an interactive job mode on Polaris as follows:\n\n```\n$ qsub -I -l select=1 -l walltime=1:00:00 -l filesystems=home:eagle -q debug -A\n\n$ module li\n\nCurrently Loaded Modules:\n  1) nvhpc/23.9          5) cray-pmi/6.1.13      9) PrgEnv-nvhpc/8.5.0      13) darshan/3.4.4\n  2) craype/2.7.30       6) cray-pals/1.3.4     10) libfabric/1.15.2.0\n  3) cray-dsmml/0.2.2    7) cray-libpals/1.3.4  11) craype-network-ofi\n  4) cray-mpich/8.1.28   8) craype-x86-milan    12) perftools-base/23.12.0"

For instance, if only your head node needed public access your select statement might looks something like: -l select=1:pubnet=True+63.\n\nControlling Where Your Job Runs\n\nIf you wish to have your job run on specific nodes form your select like this: -l select=1:vnode=<node name1>+1:vnode=<node name2>... . Obviously, that gets tedious for large jobs.\n\nIf you want to control the location of a few nodes, for example 2 out of 64, but the rest don't matter, you can do something like this: -l select=1:vnode=<node name1>+1:vnode=<node name2>+62:system=foo\n\nEvery node has a PBS resource called tier0 with a rack identifier and tier1 with a dragonfly group identifieer.  If you want all your nodes grouped in a rack, you can add the group specifier -l select=8:system=foo,place=scatter:group=tier0.  If you wanted everything in the same dragonfly group, replace tier0 with tier1.  Note that you have to also explicitly specify the place when you use group.  If you wanted a specific rack or dragonfly group instead of any of them, you are back to the select: -l select 10:tier0=x3001-g0.\n\nNetwork: Rack and Dragonfly Group Mappings",

Determine the correct compiler wrapper to use: Since we want to compile an MPI application, I will choose one of the recommended compiler wrappers (cc, CC, or ftn).\n\n3. Compile the MPI application using the chosen compiler wrapper: The command would be in the format:\n```\n<compiler_wrapper> <source_file>.c -o <output_file>\n```\nReplace `<compiler_wrapper>` with the chosen compiler wrapper (e.g., cc), `<source_file>.c` with the name of your source file, and `<output_file>` with the desired output file name.\n\n4. Add any necessary flags or options: Depending on the specific requirements of your MPI application, you may need to add additional flags or options to the compiler command.

Many tools exist to address this, of which parsl is just one.  On this page, we'll highlight some of the key pieces of information about parsl that are relevant to Polaris.  Parsl is also extensively documented, has a dedicated Slack Channel, and a large community of users and developers beyond ALCF.  We encourage you to engage with the parsl community for support with parsl specific questions, and for Polaris-specific questions or problems, please contact support@alcf.anl.gov.\n\nGetting Parsl on Polaris\n\nYou can install parsl building off of the conda modules.  You have some flexibility in how you want to extend the conda module to include parsl, but here is an example way to do it:\n\n```python\n\nLoad the Conda Module (needed everytime you use parsl)\n\nmodule load conda\nconda activate\n\nCreate a virtual env that uses the conda env as the system packages.\n\nOnly do the next line on initial set up:\n\npython -m venv --system-site-packages /path/to/your/virtualenv\n\nLoad the virtual env (every time):\n\nsource /path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/activate\n\nInstall parsl (only once)\n\npip install parsl\n\n```\n\nUsing Parsl on Polaris",

            "PyTorch Best Practices on Polaris\n\nSingle Node Performance\n\nWhen running PyTorch applications, we have found the following practices to be generally, if not universally, useful and encourage you to try some of these techniques to boost performance of your own applications.\n\nUse Reduced Precision. Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with PyTorch operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the PyTorch Automatic Mixed Precision package (AMP), as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  In PyTorch, users generally need to manage casting and loss scaling manually,  though context managers and function decorators can provide easy tools to do this.\n\nPyTorch has a JIT module as well as backends to support op fusion, similar to TensorFlow's tf.function tools.  However, PyTorch JIT capabilities are newer and may not yield performance improvements.  Please see TorchScript for more information.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nPyTorch is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with PyTorch has been seen with both DDP and Horovod.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation or the Distributed Data Parallel documentation.  Some Polaris-specific details that may be helpful to you:",

First, make sure you have the necessary environment variables set up to run libEnsemble jobs. This typically involves setting the `LIBENSEMBLE_HOME` and `PATH` variables.\n2. Next, create a batch script that specifies the desired resources for your job. In this case, you want to specify a walltime of 15 minutes and allocate filesystems to home and grand.\n\n##begin_quote##\n     #PBS -l select=1:system=polaris\n     #PBS -l walltime=00:15:00\n     #PBS -l filesystems=home:grand\n##end_quote##\n\nThese lines should be included in your batch script. The `select` directive specifies the number of nodes and the system to use, while the `walltime` directive sets the maximum runtime for the job. The `filesystems` directive allocates specific filesystems to the job.\n\n3. Once you have created your batch script, you can submit it to libEnsemble using the `qsub` command. For example:\n\n```\nqsub -v LIBENSEMBLE_HOME=/path/to/libensemble my_batch_script.sh\n```\n\nThis will submit your batch script to libEnsemble and allocate the specified resources.\n\n<ANSWER>: To submit a job for libEnsemble with a specific walltime and filesystems allocation, create a batch script that specifies the desired resources and then use the `qsub` command to submit it.",

If your build system does require GPUs, you cannot yet compile on the Polaris login nodes, as they do not currently have GPUs installed. You may in this case compile your applications on the Polaris compute nodes. Do this by submitting an interactive single-node job, or running your build system in a batch job.\n\nHome File System\n\nIs it helpful to realize that there is a single HOME filesystem for users that can be accessed from the login and computes of each production resource at ALCF. Thus, users should be mindful of modifications to their environments (e.g. .bashrc) that may cause issues to arise due to differences between the systems.\n\nCray Programming Environment\n\nThe Cray Programming Environment (PE) uses three compiler wrappers for building software. These compiler wrappers should be used when building MPI-enabled applications.\n\ncc - C compiler\n\nCC - C++ compiler\n\nftn - Fortran compiler\n\nEach of these wrappers can select a specific vendor compiler based on the PrgEnv module loaded in the environment.

For this reason, it is recommended to use start_method=\"spawn\" on Polaris when using the MpiExecLauncher as is shown in the example config above.  Alternatively, another solution is to use the GNUParallelLauncher which uses GNU Parallel to spawn processes.  GNU Parallel can be loaded in your environment with the command module load gnu-parallel.  Both of these approaches will circumvent the hang issue from using fork.\n\nUpdates\n\nFor parsl versions after July 2023, the address passed in the HighThroughputExecutor needs to be set to address = address_by_interface(\"bond0\").

Checkpointing is a mechanism that allows Slurm to save the state of a job at certain points and then resume from those points if the job fails or is terminated.\n\n##begin_quote##\nrun_dir=run_dir,\n        checkpoint_mode = 'task_exit', \n        retries=2, \n        app_cache=True, \n)##end_quote##\n\nFrom this code snippet, we can see that `checkpoint_mode` is set to `'task_exit'`. This means that Slurm will save the state of a job when it reaches the end of its task (i.e., when it completes or fails). The job's state will be saved in the specified `run_dir`.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<ANSWER>: 'task_exit',",

The specification describes directives, runtime routines, and environment variables that allow an application developer to express parallelism (e.g. shared memory multiprocessing and device offloading). Many compiler vendors provide implementations of the OpenMP specification (https://www.openmp.org/specifications).\n\nSetting the environment to use OpenMP on Polaris\n\nMany of the programming environments available on Polaris have OpenMP support.\n\nmodule OpenMP CPU support? OpenMP GPU support? PrgEnv-nvhpc yes yes llvm yes yes PrgEnv-gnu yes no PrgEnv-cray yes yes*\n\nCurrently PrgEnv-cray is not recommended for OpenMP offload.\n\nBy default, the PrgEnv-nvhpc module is loaded. To switch to other modules, you can use module switch.\n\nUsing PrgEnv-nvhpc\n\nThis is loaded by default, so there's no need to load additional modules. You can confirm that it is loaded by running module list to check that PrgEnv-nvhpc is in the list.\n\nUsing LLVM\n\nTo use the LLVM module, load the following.\nmodule load mpiwrappers/cray-mpich-llvm\nmodule load cudatoolkit-standalone\n\nSee the the LLVM compiling page here for more information.\n\nUsing PrgEnv-gnu\n\nTo switch from PrgEnv-nvhpc to PrgEnv-gnu you can run:\n\nmodule switch PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-gnu",

The context appears to be a table showing various configurations for MIG (Multi-Instance Group) compute instances. Each row represents a different configuration, with columns indicating the number of GPUs (g), memory per GPU (gb), and number of CPUs (c).\n\n##begin_quote##\n0       7g.40gb    4c.7g.40gb\n0       7g.40gb    3c.7g.40gb\n1       7g.40gb    4c.7g.40gb\n1       7g.40gb    3c.7g.40gb\n2       2g.10gb    2g.10gb\n2       4g.20gb    2c.4g.20gb\n2       4g.20gb    2c.4g.20gb\n3       2g.10gb    2g.10gb\n3       4g.20gb    2c.4g.20gb\n3       4g.20gb    2c.4g.20gb\n##end_quote##\n\nFrom this context, it appears that MIG compute instances are a type of configuration for running multiple instances of a program or application on a single machine. Each instance is allocated a specific amount of GPU memory and CPU resources.\n\nBased on the table, an MIG compute instance can have varying numbers of GPUs (2-7), memory per GPU (10-40 GB), and CPUs (2-4). This suggests that MIG instances are designed to be flexible and adaptable to different workloads or applications.\n\nTherefore, my answer is:\n\n<ANSWER>: An MIG compute instance is a configuration for running multiple program instances on a single machine, with varying numbers of GPUs, memory per GPU, and CPUs.",

First, identify the MIG compute instance IDs that you want to use. In this context, the MIG compute instances are identified by their memory and core counts (e.g., 7g.40gb, 4c.7g.40gb, etc.).\n\n##begin_quote##\n0       7g.40gb    4c.7g.40gb\n0       7g.40gb    3c.7g.40gb\n1       7g.40gb    4c.7g.40gb\n1       7g.40gb    3c.7g.40gb\n2       2g.10gb    2g.10gb\n2       4g.20gb    2c.4g.20gb\n2       4g.20gb    2c.4g.20gb\n3       2g.10gb    2g.10gb\n3       4g.20gb    2c.4g.20gb\n3       4g.20gb    2c.4g.20gb\n##end_quote##\n\n2. Once you have identified the MIG compute instances, you can specify them using the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable. For example, if you want to use MIG compute instances with IDs 0 and 1, you would set the environment variable as follows:\n\n```\nCUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1\n```\n\n3. You can also specify a range of MIG compute instances by using a hyphen (-) between the start and end IDs. For example, to use MIG compute instances with IDs 2-3, you would set the environment variable as follows:\n\n```\nCUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2-3\n```\n\n4. Finally, you can specify multiple non-consecutive MIG compute instances by separating their IDs with commas (,).

        "cot_answer": "To answer this question, I will analyze the provided configuration file `mig_config.json` and the output of `nvidia-smi -L`.\n\nFirst, let's examine the `mig_config.json` file:\n```json\n{\n  \"group1\": {\n    \"gpus\": [0, 1],\n    \"mig_enabled\": true,\n    \"instances\": {\"7g.40gb\": [\"4c.7g.40gb\", \"3c.7g.40gb\"]}\n  },\n  \"group2\": {\n    \"gpus\": [2, 3],\n    \"mig_enabled\": true,\n    \"instances\": {\"4g.20gb\": [\"2c.4g.20gb\", \"2c.4g.20gb\"], \"2g.10gb\": [\"2g.10gb\"]}\n  }\n}\n```\nThis file defines two groups of GPUs, each with its own set of instances.\n\nNext, let's look at the output of `nvidia-smi -L`:\n```bash\nMIG-63aa18... (multiple lines)\nMIG-b86... (multiple lines)\n...\nMIG-4d5c9fb3... (multiple lines)\nMIG-bdfeeb2d... (multiple lines)\n...\n```\nThis output lists the MIG IDs of the available GPUs.\n\nNow, let's analyze the `for` loop that runs the `saxpy` command:\n```bash\nfor mig in $( nvidia-smi -L | grep -Po -e \"MIG[0-9a-f-]+\" ) ; do CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=${mig} ./saxpy & done 2>/dev/null\n```\nThis loop iterates over the MIG IDs listed by `nvidia-smi -L` and sets the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable to each MIG ID. It then runs the `saxpy` command with that environment variable set.\n\nFinally, let's look at the output of `nvidia-smi`:\n```bash\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Processes:                                                                   |\n|  GPU   GI   CI        PID   Type   Process name                  GPU Memory |\n|        ID   ID                                                   Usage       |\n|=============================================================================|\n|    0    0    0      17480      C    .saxpy                          84MiB |\n```\nThis output shows that the `saxpy` command is running on GPU 0 with MIG ID `MIG-...`.\n\nFrom this analysis, we can conclude that:\n\n* Each group of GPUs (group1 and group2) has its own set of instances.\n* The `mig_config.json` file defines the instances for each group.\n* The `nvidia-smi -L` output lists the MIG IDs of the available GPUs.\n* The `for` loop iterates over the MIG IDs and sets the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable to each MIG ID.\n\nTherefore, we can answer the question as follows:\n\n<ANSWER>: Each group of GPUs (group1 and group2) can create one instance per GPU.",

The columns appear to represent different threads or processes, with the first column indicating the thread ID.\n\n##begin_quote##\n|    0    0    0      17480      C   ./saxpy                          84MiB |\n|    0    0    1      17481      C   ./saxpy                          8MiB |\n|    1    0    0      17482      C   ./saxpy                          84MiB |\n##end_quote##\n\nNotice that the thread IDs (first column) are not sequential, but rather seem to be jumping around (e.g., from 0 to 1). This suggests that the execution is not strictly sequential.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, we can see that some threads are executing in a seemingly sequential manner. For example:\n\n##begin_quote##\n|    2    1    0      17484      C   ./saxpy                          83MiB |\n|    2    1    1      17485      C   ./saxpy                          83MiB |\n##end_quote##\n\nHere, threads with ID 2 are executing in a sequential manner, as the thread IDs are consecutive.\n\nGiven this mixed pattern of sequential and non-sequential execution, I would conclude that:\n\n<ANSWER>: Parallel Execution",

Obviously, that gets tedious for large jobs.\n\nIf you want to control the location of a few nodes, for example 2 out of 64, but the rest don't matter, you can do something like this: -l select=1:vnode=<node name1>+1:vnode=<node name2>+62:system=foo\n\nEvery node has a PBS resource called tier0 with a rack identifier and tier1 with a dragonfly group identifieer.  If you want all your nodes grouped in a rack, you can add the group specifier -l select=8:system=foo,place=scatter:group=tier0.  If you wanted everything in the same dragonfly group, replace tier0 with tier1.  Note that you have to also explicitly specify the place when you use group.  If you wanted a specific rack or dragonfly group instead of any of them, you are back to the select: -l select 10:tier0=x3001-g0.\n\nNetwork: Rack and Dragonfly Group Mappings",

            "Compiling and Linking Overview on Polaris\n\nCompiling on Polaris Login and Compute Nodes\n\nIf your build system does not require GPUs for the build process, as is usually the case, compilation of GPU-accelerated codes is generally expected to work well on the Polaris login nodes. If your build system does require GPUs, you cannot yet compile on the Polaris login nodes, as they do not currently have GPUs installed. You may in this case compile your applications on the Polaris compute nodes. Do this by submitting an interactive single-node job, or running your build system in a batch job.\n\nHome File System\n\nIs it helpful to realize that there is a single HOME filesystem for users that can be accessed from the login and computes of each production resource at ALCF. Thus, users should be mindful of modifications to their environments (e.g. .bashrc) that may cause issues to arise due to differences between the systems.\n\nCray Programming Environment\n\nThe Cray Programming Environment (PE) uses three compiler wrappers for building software. These compiler wrappers should be used when building MPI-enabled applications.\n\ncc - C compiler\n\nCC - C++ compiler\n\nftn - Fortran compiler\n\nEach of these wrappers can select a specific vendor compiler based on the PrgEnv module loaded in the environment. The following are some helpful options to understand what the compiler wrapper is invoking.\n\n--craype-verbose : Print the command which is forwarded to the compiler invocation",

Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with TensorFlow operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the tf.keras.mixed_precision Policy, as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  If you use a custom training loop (and not keras.Model.fit), you will also need to apply loss scaling.\n\nUse TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.  Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.  When possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention."

            "Running GPU-enabled Applications\n\nGPU-enabled applications will similarly run on the compute nodes using the above example script.\n- The environment variable MPICH_GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED=1 needs to be set if your application requires MPI-GPU support whereby the MPI library sends and receives data directly from GPU buffers. In this case, it will be important to have the craype-accel-nvidia80 module loaded both when compiling your application and during runtime to correctly link against a GPU Transport Layer (GTL) MPI library. Otherwise, you'll likely see GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED is requested, but GTL library is not linked errors during runtime.\n- If running on a specific GPU or subset of GPUs is desired, then the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable can be used. For example, if one only wanted an application to access the first two GPUs on a node, then setting CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 could be used.\n\nBinding MPI ranks to GPUs\n\nThe Cray MPI on Polaris does not currently support binding MPI ranks to GPUs. For applications that need this support, this instead can be handled by use of a small helper script that will appropriately set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES for each MPI rank. One example is available here where each MPI rank is similarly bound to a single GPU with round-robin assignment.\n\nA example set_affinity_gpu_polaris.sh script follows where GPUs are assigned round-robin to MPI ranks.\n\n```bash\n\n!/bin/bash -l\n\nnum_gpus=4\n\nneed to assign GPUs in reverse order due to topology",

To answer this, we need to understand what `TMPDIR` is used for and where it is currently set.\n\nAccording to the context, `TMPDIR` is set to `/local/scratch` in the `setup_env.sh` script. This suggests that the current setting is already recommending a local directory on each compute node.\n\nThe reason for this recommendation is explained in the context: CUDA.jl uses the nvcc compiler to compile GPU kernels, which creates object files in the TEMP filesystem. The default `TMPDIR` in a job on Polaris is set to a temp directory that only exists on the head node of a job. This means that if we don't set `TMPDIR` to a local directory on each compute node, the object files created by CUDA.jl will not be accessible from other nodes.\n\nTherefore, setting `TMPDIR` to a local directory on each compute node ensures that the object files are stored in a location that is accessible from all nodes, which is necessary for large-scale parallelism.\n\nFinal answer:\n<ANSWER>: It is recommended to set `TMPDIR` to a local directory on each compute node instead of its default location because it allows CUDA.jl to store object files in a location that is accessible from all nodes, which is necessary for large-scale parallelism.",

If your build system does require GPUs, you cannot yet compile on the Polaris login nodes, as they do not currently have GPUs installed. You may in this case compile your applications on the Polaris compute nodes. Do this by submitting an interactive single-node job, or running your build system in a batch job.\n\nHome File System\n\nIs it helpful to realize that there is a single HOME filesystem for users that can be accessed from the login and computes of each production resource at ALCF. Thus, users should be mindful of modifications to their environments (e.g. .bashrc) that may cause issues to arise due to differences between the systems.\n\nCray Programming Environment\n\nThe Cray Programming Environment (PE) uses three compiler wrappers for building software. These compiler wrappers should be used when building MPI-enabled applications.\n\ncc - C compiler\n\nCC - C++ compiler\n\nftn - Fortran compiler\n\nEach of these wrappers can select a specific vendor compiler based on the PrgEnv module loaded in the environment. The following are some helpful options to understand what the compiler wrapper is invoking.\n\n--craype-verbose : Print the command which is forwarded to the compiler invocation",

If your code is complex, or has dynamically sized tensors (tensors where the shape changes every iteration), XLA can be detrimental: the overhead for compiling functions can be large enough to mitigate performance improvements.

It also compares this method to cloning the environment or using `venv`, which are considered more flexible and transparent.\n\nTo determine if multiple environments can be used in one installation of Anaconda, I'll focus on the `bash` method mentioned in the context. The key sentence is: \"export PATH=\\\"$PYTHONUSERBASE/bin:$PATH\\\"\". This suggests that Anaconda is being installed as a user-level environment, which implies that it's possible to have multiple environments within this installation.\n\n##begin_quote##\nBe sure to remove this location from #!bash $PATH if you deactivate the base\nAnaconda environment or unload the module.\n##end_quote##\n\nThis quote reinforces my initial assumption. It suggests that there is a \"base\" Anaconda environment, which can be deactivated or unloaded, implying that other environments can coexist within the same installation.\n\nBased on this analysis, I conclude that yes, it is possible to use multiple environments in one installation of Anaconda when using the `bash` method.\n\n<ANSWER>: Yes",

            "Use XLA compilation on your code.  XLA is the Accelerated Linear Algebra library that is available in tensorFlow and critical in software like JAX.  XLA will compile a tf.Graph object, generated with tf.function or similar, and perform optimizations like operation-fusion.  XLA can give impressive performance boosts with almost no user changes except to set an environment variable TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2.  If your code is complex, or has dynamically sized tensors (tensors where the shape changes every iteration), XLA can be detrimental: the overhead for compiling functions can be large enough to mitigate performance improvements.  XLA is particularly powerful when combined with reduced precision, yielding speedups > 100% in some models.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nTensorFlow is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with tensorFlow has been seen with horovod in particular.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation.  Some polaris specific details that may be helpful to you:\n\nCPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.  In particular, we encourage users to try their scaling measurements with the following settings:\n\nSet the environment variable NCCL_COLLNET_ENABLE=1\n\nSet the environment varialbe NCCL_NET_GDR_LEVEL=PHB",

According to the context, JAX is a popular Python package for accelerated computing that is built on XLA and AutoGrad. It has acceleration tools such as vmap, jit, etc. that operate on functions.\n\nThe context also mentions that JAX is not as widely used in machine learning as TensorFlow and PyTorch for traditional models like computer vision and language models. However, it is gaining prominence quickly. The key point here is that JAX is powerful when a program needs non-traditional autodifferentiation or vectorization.\n\nThe context also provides information on how to install JAX on Polaris using the conda module. It mentions that users of JAX on Polaris are encouraged to read the user documentation in detail, particularly about pure-functional programming, no in-place operations, and common mistakes in writing functions for the @jit decorator.\n\nFinally, the context notes a bug on Polaris where an environment variable must be set to use JAX on GPUs. This is important because it means that without setting this environment variable, using JAX on GPUs will result in an error.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n<ANSWER>: JAX is used for non-traditional autodifferentiation or vectorization in machine learning, particularly when traditional models like computer vision and language models are not sufficient.",

It consists of a base stack (spack-pe-base)\nand PrgEnv-dependent stacks (currently spack-pe-gnu).\n\nspack-pe-base contains commonplace software compiled for CPU with the system\nGCC compilers. Accordingly, the software in spack-pe-base can be used\nregardless of programming environment.\n\nspack-pe-gnu is based on the E4S Project and\nprovides performant HPC libraries built with PrgEnv-gnu and the nvcc CUDA\ncompiler driver for GPU code. spack-pe-gnu is dependent on both\nspack-pe-base and PrgEnv-gnu.\n\nUsing software from the Spack PE\n\nThe base suite of software tools and libraries can be accessed by loading the\nspack-pe-base module. This adds a path to $MODULEPATH which contains\nnumerous modules.\n\nFor example, to load cmake starting from the default environment, a user\nshould run the following commands:\nmodule use /soft/modulefiles\nmodule load spack-pe-base\nmodule load cmake\n\nThe spack-pe-base module adds paths to the user's MODULEPATH; individual packages are subsequently loaded through the newly available modules. The full list of available packages can be viewed by running module avail or module --show-hidden avail for a complete listing.

For example, the -cuda flag instructs nvcc to compile .cu input files to .cu.cpp.ii output files which are to be separately compiled, whereas the same -cuda flag instructs nvc, nvc++, and nvfortran to enable CUDA C/C++ or CUDA Fortran code generation.

Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with TensorFlow operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the tf.keras.mixed_precision Policy, as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  If you use a custom training loop (and not keras.Model.fit), you will also need to apply loss scaling.\n\nUse TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.

Do this by submitting an interactive single-node job, or running your build system in a batch job.\n\nHome File System\n\nIs it helpful to realize that there is a single HOME filesystem for users that can be accessed from the login and computes of each production resource at ALCF. Thus, users should be mindful of modifications to their environments (e.g. .bashrc) that may cause issues to arise due to differences between the systems.\n\nCray Programming Environment\n\nThe Cray Programming Environment (PE) uses three compiler wrappers for building software.

Designed at MIT to tackle large-scale\npartial-differential equation simulation and distributed linear algebra, Julia\nfeatures a robust ecosystem of tools for\noptimization,\nstatistics, parallel programming, and data\nvisualization. Julia is actively developed by the Julia\nLabs team at MIT and in\nindustry, along with hundreds of domain-expert\nscientists and programmers worldwide.\n\nContributing\n\nThis guide is a first draft of the Julia documentation for Polaris. If you have any\nsuggestions or contributions, please open a pull request or contact us by\nopening a ticket at the ALCF Helpdesk.\n\nJulia Installation\n\nWe encourage users interested in using Julia on Polaris to install in their home or project directories at this time. Using the official Julia 1.9 binaries from the Julia\nwebpage is recommended.\nJuliaup provides a convenient way to\ninstall Julia and manage the various Julia versions. The default installation will install julia, juliaup, and other commands in a ${HOME}/.julia directory and update profile files like .bashrc to update PATH to include that directory. One can customize the installation to change these defaults.\n\nbash\nmodule load craype-accel-nvidia80\ncurl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh",

Developers can optimize bottlenecks to scale efficiently across any number or size of CPUs and GPUs on Polaris. For further optimizations to compute kernels developers should use Nsight Compute.\n\nThe NVIDIA Nsight Compute is an interactive kernel profiler for CUDA applications. It provides detailed performance metrics and API debugging via a user interface and command line tool.\n\nIn addition, the baseline feature of this tool allows users to compare results within the tool. NVIDIA Nsight Compute provides a customizable and data-driven user interface,  metric collection, and can be extended with analysis scripts for post-processing results.\n\nStep-by-step guide\n\nCommon part on Polaris\n\nBuild your application for Polaris, and then submit your job script to Polaris or start an interactive job mode on Polaris as follows:\n\n```\n$ qsub -I -l select=1 -l walltime=1:00:00 -l filesystems=home:eagle -q debug -A\n\n$ module li\n\nCurrently Loaded Modules:\n  1) nvhpc/23.9          5) cray-pmi/6.1.13      9) PrgEnv-nvhpc/8.5.0      13) darshan/3.4.4\n  2) craype/2.7.30       6) cray-pals/1.3.4     10) libfabric/1.15.2.0\n  3) cray-dsmml/0.2.2    7) cray-libpals/1.3.4  11) craype-network-ofi\n  4) cray-mpich/8.1.28   8) craype-x86-milan    12) perftools-base/23.12.0"

Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with TensorFlow operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the tf.keras.mixed_precision Policy, as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  If you use a custom training loop (and not keras.Model.fit), you will also need to apply loss scaling.\n\nUse TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.  Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.  When possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention.",

        "question": "What should you check if you encounter permission errors during a build?",
        "cot_answer": "To answer this question, I will provide step-by-step reasoning based on the given context.\n\n**Step 1: Check Quota and Delete Unnecessary Files**\nIf you encounter permission errors during a build, it's essential to check your quota and delete any unnecessary files. This is because high disk usage can lead to permission issues. ##begin_quote##Check your quota and delete any unnecessary files.##end_quote##\n\n**Step 2: Clean-up Apptainer Cache**\nAnother potential cause of permission errors is an outdated or corrupted apptainer cache. To resolve this, clean up the apptainer cache by running the following commands:\n```\nexport APPTAINER_TMPDIR=/tmp/apptainer-tmpdir\nmkdir $APPTAINER_TMPDIR\nexport APPTAINER_CACHEDIR=/tmp/apptainer-cachedir/\nmkdir $APPTAINER_CACHEDIR\n```\n**Step 3: Check Symlink**\nIt's also crucial to check if you're accessing a directory via a symlink. If `pwd` and `pwd -P` return different paths, it may indicate that you're on a directory accessed with a symlink. ##begin_quote##Make sure you are not on a directory accessed with a symlink, i.e. check if pwd and pwd -P returns the same path.##end_quote##\n\n**Step 4: Run Build in Home Directory**\nIf none of the above steps resolve the issue, try running the build in your home directory. This can help isolate any permission issues related to the current working directory.\n\n**Step 5: MPI Alignment (for Polaris)**\nFor builds on Polaris, ensure that the container's MPI aligns with the system MPI. Follow the additional steps outlined in the container registry documentation for MPI on Polaris.\n\n**Step 6: libmpi.so.40 Not Found (for OpenMPI)**\nIf you encounter a \"libmpi.so.40 not found\" error, it may indicate an OpenMPI dependency that is not currently supported on Polaris. To resolve this, ensure that the application has an MPICH implementation as well.\n\n**Step 7: Remove Cache Folders (for Conda)**\nFinally, if none of the above steps work, try removing `.conda`, `.cache`, and `.local` folders from your home directory and rebuild the container.\n\n**Final Answer**\n<ANSWER>: Check quota and delete unnecessary files, clean up apptainer cache, check symlink, run build in home directory, ensure MPI alignment (for Polaris), resolve libmpi.so.40 not found error (for OpenMPI), and remove cache folders (for Conda).",

This suggests that there might be some permission issues or differences in file system layout between the two scenarios.\n\n##begin_quote##\nMake sure you are not on a directory accessed with a symlink, i.e. check if `pwd` and `pwd -P` returns the same path.\n##end_quote##\n\nThis implies that we should check if the current working directory is being accessed through a symbolic link. If it's not, then the issue might be related to permissions or file system layout.\n\nOne possible solution could be to ensure that the build process has the necessary permissions and access rights to write files in the target directory. This could involve adjusting the ownership of the directory or its contents, or setting the correct permissions using `chmod` or `chown`.\n\nAnother possibility is that there's a difference in file system layout between the home directory and the directory accessed through the symlink. In this case, we might need to investigate further to determine what specific files or directories are causing the issue.\n\nFinal answer:\n<ANSWER>: Adjust permissions or file system layout to ensure consistent access rights across both scenarios.",

            "PyTorch Best Practices on Polaris\n\nSingle Node Performance\n\nWhen running PyTorch applications, we have found the following practices to be generally, if not universally, useful and encourage you to try some of these techniques to boost performance of your own applications.\n\nUse Reduced Precision. Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with PyTorch operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the PyTorch Automatic Mixed Precision package (AMP), as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  In PyTorch, users generally need to manage casting and loss scaling manually,  though context managers and function decorators can provide easy tools to do this.\n\nPyTorch has a JIT module as well as backends to support op fusion, similar to TensorFlow's tf.function tools.  However, PyTorch JIT capabilities are newer and may not yield performance improvements.  Please see TorchScript for more information.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nPyTorch is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with PyTorch has been seen with both DDP and Horovod.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation or the Distributed Data Parallel documentation.  Some Polaris-specific details that may be helpful to you:",

Furthermore, qalter requires -A <allocation name> when changing job properties.

            "Running GPU-enabled Applications\n\nGPU-enabled applications will similarly run on the compute nodes using the above example script.\n- The environment variable MPICH_GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED=1 needs to be set if your application requires MPI-GPU support whereby the MPI library sends and receives data directly from GPU buffers. In this case, it will be important to have the craype-accel-nvidia80 module loaded both when compiling your application and during runtime to correctly link against a GPU Transport Layer (GTL) MPI library. Otherwise, you'll likely see GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED is requested, but GTL library is not linked errors during runtime.\n- If running on a specific GPU or subset of GPUs is desired, then the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable can be used. For example, if one only wanted an application to access the first two GPUs on a node, then setting CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 could be used.\n\nBinding MPI ranks to GPUs\n\nThe Cray MPI on Polaris does not currently support binding MPI ranks to GPUs. For applications that need this support, this instead can be handled by use of a small helper script that will appropriately set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES for each MPI rank. One example is available here where each MPI rank is similarly bound to a single GPU with round-robin assignment.\n\nA example set_affinity_gpu_polaris.sh script follows where GPUs are assigned round-robin to MPI ranks.\n\n```bash\n\n!/bin/bash -l\n\nnum_gpus=4\n\nneed to assign GPUs in reverse order due to topology",

In this case, it will be important to have the craype-accel-nvidia80 module loaded both when compiling your application and during runtime to correctly link against a GPU Transport Layer (GTL) MPI library. Otherwise, you'll likely see GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED is requested, but GTL library is not linked errors during runtime.\n- If running on a specific GPU or subset of GPUs is desired, then the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable can be used. For example, if one only wanted an application to access the first two GPUs on a node, then setting CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 could be used.\n\nBinding MPI ranks to GPUs\n\nThe Cray MPI on Polaris does not currently support binding MPI ranks to GPUs. For applications that need this support, this instead can be handled by use of a small helper script that will appropriately set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES for each MPI rank. One example is available here where each MPI rank is similarly bound to a single GPU with round-robin assignment.\n\nA example set_affinity_gpu_polaris.sh script follows where GPUs are assigned round-robin to MPI ranks.\n\n```bash\n\n!/bin/bash -l\n\nnum_gpus=4\n\nneed to assign GPUs in reverse order due to topology"

        "question": "What is a submission script in high-performance computing?",
        "cot_answer": "<ANSWER>: A submission script is a shell script that defines the job requirements and settings for running a high-performance computing (HPC) application on a cluster. In this context, it appears to be used to run VASP (Vienna Ab-Initio Simulation Package) on the Polaris cluster.\n\nTo answer this question, I will provide step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The given example script is a submission script for running VASP on Polaris.\n2. It starts with shebang lines `#!/bin/sh` and `#!/bin/sh`, which specify the interpreter to use when executing the script.\n3. The script uses PBS (Portable Batch System) directives to define job requirements, such as the number of nodes (`-l select=1:system=polaris`), placement (`-l place=scatter`), walltime (`-l walltime=0:30:00`), and filesystems (`-l filesystems=home:grand:eagle`).\n4. The script also specifies a queue (`-q debug`) and an account name (`-A MYPROJECT`).\n5. It loads various modules using the `module load` command, which provides access to specific software packages.\n6. The script sets environment variables, such as `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, to include directories containing libraries required by VASP.\n7. It defines several variables related to node and rank information (`NNODES`, `NRANKS`, `NDEPTH`, `NTHREADS`, and `NGPUS`).\n8. Finally, the script runs VASP using `mpiexec` with specific options and arguments.\n\nIn summary, a submission script is a shell script that defines job requirements and settings for running an HPC application on a cluster. It typically includes PBS directives, module loading, environment variable setting, and command execution.\n\n<ANSWER>: A submission script in high-performance computing is a shell script that defines the job requirements and settings for running a high-performance computing (HPC) application on a cluster.",

E.g. if a user submits a script to the prod routing queue requesting 10 nodes for 24 hours, exceeding \"Time Max\" of 6 hrs of the small execution queue (which handles jobs with 10-24 nodes), then it may behave as if the job was never submitted.\n\nJob scripts are copied to temporary locations after qsub and any changes to the original script while the job is queued will not be reflected in the copied script. Furthermore, qalter requires -A <allocation name> when changing job properties.

This guide details the use of containers on Polaris, including custom container creation, large-scale execution, and common pitfalls.\n\nApptainer Setup\n\nPolaris employs Apptainer (formerly known as Singularity) for container management. To set up Apptainer, run:\n\nbash\nmodule use /soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/install/modulefiles/Core\nmodule load apptainer\napptainer version #1.2.2\n\nThe Apptainer version on Polaris is 1.2.2. Detailed user documentation is available here\n\nBuilding from Docker or Argonne GitHub Container Registry\n\nContainers on Polaris can be built by writing Dockerfiles on a local machine and then publish the container to DockerHub, or by directly building them on ALCF compute node by writing an Apptainer recipe file. If you prefer to use existing containers, you can pull them from various registries like DockerHub and run them on Polaris.\n\nSince Docker requires root privileges, which users do not have on Polaris, existing Docker containers must be converted to Apptainer. To build a Docker-based container on Polaris, use the following as an example:",

JAX is built on XLA (the same XLA TensorFlow uses) as well as AutoGrad, and additionally has acceleration tools that operate on functions such as vmap, jit, etc.  JAX is not as widespread in machine learning as TensorFlow and PyTorch for traditional models (Computer Vision, Language Models) though it is quickly gaining promienence.  JAX is very powerful when a program needs non-traditional autodifferentiation or vectorizatoin, such as: forward-mode AD, higher order derivatives, Jacobians, Hessians, or any combination of the above.  Users of JAX on Polaris are encouraged to read the user documentation in detail, particularly the details about pure-functional programming, no in-place operations, and the common mistakes in writing functions for the @jit decorator.\n\nJAX on Polaris\n\nJAX is installed on Polaris via the conda module, available with:\nbash\nmodule load conda; conda activate\n\nThen, you can load JAX in python as usual (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):\n\n```python\n\nimport jax\njax.version\n'0.3.15'\n\n```\n\nNotes on JAX 0.3.15\n\nOn Polaris, due to a bug, an environment variable must be set to use JAX on GPUs.

XLA will compile a tf.Graph object, generated with tf.function or similar, and perform optimizations like operation-fusion.  XLA can give impressive performance boosts with almost no user changes except to set an environment variable TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2.  If your code is complex, or has dynamically sized tensors (tensors where the shape changes every iteration), XLA can be detrimental: the overhead for compiling functions can be large enough to mitigate performance improvements.  XLA is particularly powerful when combined with reduced precision, yielding speedups > 100% in some models.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nTensorFlow is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with tensorFlow has been seen with horovod in particular.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation.

            "Polaris System Updates\n\n2024-04-22\n\nThe management software on Polaris has been upgraded to HPCM 1.10\nThe following version changes are in place with the upgrade to HPCM 1.10:\n\nHPE Cray Programming Environment (CPE) 23.12\n\nSlingShot version 2.1.2\n\nNVIDIA SDK 23.9\n\nNVIDIA driver version 535.154.05\n\nCUDA 12.2\n\nSUSE 15 SP5\n\nReleasing jobs\n\nJobs that were queued before the upgrade have been restored to the appropriate queues but are placed on user hold. \nJobs are not expected to complete successfully due to the changes made to the system and software environments resulting from the upgrade. \nWe recommend you review your jobs and either release the hold (qrls <jobid>) or delete it (qdel <jobid>) and resubmit as appropriate.\n\nUsers need to rebuild for the new PE environment and major OS upgrade. Existing binaries are unlikely to run successfully.\n\nWe have held all jobs submitted prior to the upgrade as a user hold. Users may release their existing jobs with qrls to run after they have rebuilt their binaries.\n\nPBS does cache the job execution script.  If a change to the script is required due to a path changing post rebuild, the job will have to be resubmitted.\n\nAll application binaries should be rebuilt prior to further job submissions.\n\nRe-building user codes\n\nMany user codes will need to be re-built and/or re-linked against the newer version of the programming environment (23.12) and Spack provided dependencies.\n\nChanges to the user software environment",

For example, the -cuda flag instructs nvcc to compile .cu input files to .cu.cpp.ii output files which are to be separately compiled, whereas the same -cuda flag instructs nvc, nvc++, and nvfortran to enable CUDA C/C++ or CUDA Fortran code generation. The resulting output file in each case is different (text vs. object) and one may see unrecognized format error when -cuda is incorrectly passed to nvcc.\n\nKnown Issues and Workarounds\n\nIf you are using nvcc to invoke nvc++ and compiling C++17 code, and are seeing the following warning and unable to compile C++17 constructs:\n\n```\npolaris-login-01(~)> nvcc --std=c++17 -ccbin nvc++ ~/smalltests/bool_constant.cpp\nnvcc warning : The -std=c++17 flag is not supported with the configured host compiler.

For example, the -cuda flag instructs nvcc to compile .cu input files to .cu.cpp.ii output files which are to be separately compiled, whereas the same -cuda flag instructs nvc, nvc++, and nvfortran to enable CUDA C/C++ or CUDA Fortran code generation. The resulting output file in each case is different (text vs. object) and one may see unrecognized format error when -cuda is incorrectly passed to nvcc.\n\nKnown Issues and Workarounds\n\nIf you are using nvcc to invoke nvc++ and compiling C++17 code, and are seeing the following warning and unable to compile C++17 constructs:\n\n```\npolaris-login-01(~)> nvcc --std=c++17 -ccbin nvc++ ~/smalltests/bool_constant.cpp\nnvcc warning : The -std=c++17 flag is not supported with the configured host compiler.

A Balsam Site runs on a node with access to the job scheduler, where it can submit and monitor jobs. Overall job state is aggregated on the Balsam Server, making job data from all Sites accessible from any individual site (or the user's laptop), via the command-line interface or the Python API. To get information on how to use the command line tool, you can type balsam --help in your shell.\n\nFull documentation for Balsam is available online.\n\nBalsam requires Python 3.7+. To install Balsam on Polaris, first set up a virtual Python environment:\n\nshell\nmodule load conda\nconda activate base\npython -m venv env\nsource env/bin/activate\npip install --upgrade pip\npip install --pre balsam\n\nTo use Balsam, users need an account on the Balsam server.  Users can get an account by contacting the ALCF Help Desk.  Once a user has an account, they can login and make a new site.  A Balsam site is a project space for your workflow. You will be prompted to select what machine (Polaris) you are working on when creating a new site:\n\nshell\nbalsam login\nbalsam site init -n new-site new-site\ncd new-site\nbalsam site start\n\nSee the Balsam documentation for full details.",

The Cray MPI wrappers will handle this automatically.\n\nNotes on Default Modules\n\ncraype-x86-rome: While the Polaris compute nodes currently have Milan CPUs, this module is loaded by default to avoid the craype-x86-milan module from adding a zen3 target not supported in the default nvhpc/21.9 compilers. The craype-x86-milan module is expected to be made default once a newer nvhpc version (e.g. 22.5) is made the default.\n\ncraype-accel-nvidia80: This module adds compiler flags to enable GPU acceleration for NVHPC compilers along with gpu-enabled MPI libraries as it is assumed that the majority of applications to be compiled on Polaris will target the GPUs for acceleration. Users building cpu-only applications may find it useful to unload this module to silence \"gpu code generation\" warnings.\n\nMixed C/C++ & Fortran Applications\n\nFor applications consisting of a mix of C/C++ and Fortran that also uses MPI, it is suggested that the programming environment chosen for Fortran be used to build the full application because of mpi.mod (and similar) incompatibilities.\n\nCompiling for GPUs",

The various compilers and libraries are present on the logins, so most users should be able to build their code.  However, if your build requires the physical presence of the GPU, you will need to build on a compute node.\n\nAll users share the same login nodes so please be courteous and respectful of your fellow users.

This enables developers to debug applications without the potential variations introduced by simulation and emulation environments.\n\nStep-by-step guide\n\nDebug Compilation\n\nNVCC, the NVIDIA CUDA compiler driver, provides a mechanism for generating the debugging information necessary for CUDA-GDB to work properly. The -g -G option pair must be passed to NVCC when an application is compiled for ease of debugging with CUDA-GDB; for example,\nnvcc -g -G foo.cu -o foo\nUsing this line to compile the CUDA application foo.cu\n* forces -O0 compilation, with the exception of very limited dead-code eliminations and register-spilling optimizations.\n* makes the compiler include debug information in the executable\n\nRunning CUDA-gdb on Polaris compute nodes\n\nStart an interactive job mode on Polaris as follows:\n\n```\n$ qsub -I -l select=1 -l walltime=1:00:00",

It is primarily designed for biochemical molecules like proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids that have a lot of complicated bonded interactions, but since GROMACS is extremely fast at calculating the nonbonded interactions (that usually dominate simulations) many groups are also using it for research on non-biological systems, e.g. polymers.\n\nUsing GROMACS at ALCF\n\nALCF offers assistance with building binaries and compiling instructions for GROMACS.

            "PyTorch Best Practices on Polaris\n\nSingle Node Performance\n\nWhen running PyTorch applications, we have found the following practices to be generally, if not universally, useful and encourage you to try some of these techniques to boost performance of your own applications.\n\nUse Reduced Precision. Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with PyTorch operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the PyTorch Automatic Mixed Precision package (AMP), as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  In PyTorch, users generally need to manage casting and loss scaling manually,  though context managers and function decorators can provide easy tools to do this.\n\nPyTorch has a JIT module as well as backends to support op fusion, similar to TensorFlow's tf.function tools.  However, PyTorch JIT capabilities are newer and may not yield performance improvements.  Please see TorchScript for more information.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nPyTorch is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with PyTorch has been seen with both DDP and Horovod.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation or the Distributed Data Parallel documentation.  Some Polaris-specific details that may be helpful to you:"

To use it from a compute node, please do:\n\nbash\nmodule load conda\nconda activate\n\nThen, you can load TensorFlow in python as usual (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):\n\n```python\n\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.version\n'2.9.1'\n\n```\n\nThis installation of TensorFlow was built from source and the CUDA libraries it uses are found via the CUDA_HOME environment variable (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):\n\nbash\n$ echo $CUDA_HOME\n/soft/datascience/cuda/cuda_11.5.2_495.29.05_linux\n\nIf you need to build applications that use this version of TensorFlow and CUDA, we recommend using these cuda libraries to ensure compatibility.

            "Compiling and Linking Overview on Polaris\n\nCompiling on Polaris Login and Compute Nodes\n\nIf your build system does not require GPUs for the build process, as is usually the case, compilation of GPU-accelerated codes is generally expected to work well on the Polaris login nodes. If your build system does require GPUs, you cannot yet compile on the Polaris login nodes, as they do not currently have GPUs installed. You may in this case compile your applications on the Polaris compute nodes. Do this by submitting an interactive single-node job, or running your build system in a batch job.\n\nHome File System\n\nIs it helpful to realize that there is a single HOME filesystem for users that can be accessed from the login and computes of each production resource at ALCF. Thus, users should be mindful of modifications to their environments (e.g. .bashrc) that may cause issues to arise due to differences between the systems.\n\nCray Programming Environment\n\nThe Cray Programming Environment (PE) uses three compiler wrappers for building software. These compiler wrappers should be used when building MPI-enabled applications.\n\ncc - C compiler\n\nCC - C++ compiler\n\nftn - Fortran compiler\n\nEach of these wrappers can select a specific vendor compiler based on the PrgEnv module loaded in the environment.

Obviously, that gets tedious for large jobs.\n\nIf you want to control the location of a few nodes, for example 2 out of 64, but the rest don't matter, you can do something like this: -l select=1:vnode=<node name1>+1:vnode=<node name2>+62:system=foo\n\nEvery node has a PBS resource called tier0 with a rack identifier and tier1 with a dragonfly group identifieer.  If you want all your nodes grouped in a rack, you can add the group specifier -l select=8:system=foo,place=scatter:group=tier0.  If you wanted everything in the same dragonfly group, replace tier0 with tier1.  Note that you have to also explicitly specify the place when you use group.  If you wanted a specific rack or dragonfly group instead of any of them, you are back to the select: -l select 10:tier0=x3001-g0.\n\nNetwork: Rack and Dragonfly Group Mappings",

In this case, it will be important to have the craype-accel-nvidia80 module loaded both when compiling your application and during runtime to correctly link against a GPU Transport Layer (GTL) MPI library. Otherwise, you'll likely see GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED is requested, but GTL library is not linked errors during runtime.\n- If running on a specific GPU or subset of GPUs is desired, then the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable can be used. For example, if one only wanted an application to access the first two GPUs on a node, then setting CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 could be used.\n\nBinding MPI ranks to GPUs\n\nThe Cray MPI on Polaris does not currently support binding MPI ranks to GPUs.

CUDA-GDB is an extension to GDB, the GNU Project debugger. The tool provides developers with a mechanism for debugging CUDA applications running on actual hardware. This enables developers to debug applications without the potential variations introduced by simulation and emulation environments.\n\nStep-by-step guide\n\nDebug Compilation\n\nNVCC, the NVIDIA CUDA compiler driver, provides a mechanism for generating the debugging information necessary for CUDA-GDB to work properly. The -g -G option pair must be passed to NVCC when an application is compiled for ease of debugging with CUDA-GDB; for example,\nnvcc -g -G foo.cu -o foo\nUsing this line to compile the CUDA application foo.cu\n* forces -O0 compilation, with the exception of very limited dead-code eliminations and register-spilling optimizations.\n* makes the compiler include debug information in the executable\n\nRunning CUDA-gdb on Polaris compute nodes\n\nStart an interactive job mode on Polaris as follows:\n\n```\n$ qsub -I -l select=1 -l walltime=1:00:00",

Start by submitting a job script to the queue manager using the `qsub` command:\n```\n$ qsub -I -l select=1 -l walltime=1:00:00\n```\nThis will allocate a single node for 1 hour and allow you to interactively run your job.\n\n##begin_quote##\nStart an interactive job mode on Polaris as follows:\n##end_quote##\n\n2. Once the job is allocated, you can start the CUDA-GDB debugger by running the following command:\n```\n$ cuda-gdb my_cuda_app\n```\nReplace `my_cuda_app` with the name of your CUDA application.\n\n3. You will then be dropped into an interactive GDB prompt where you can set breakpoints, step through code, and inspect variables using standard GDB commands.\n\n<ANSWER>: Start an interactive job mode on Polaris compute nodes using CUDA-GDB: $ qsub -I -l select=1 -l walltime=1:00:00; then run cuda-gdb my_cuda_app.",

In the example below, four instances of the application are simultaneously running on a single node. In the first instance, the application is spawning MPI ranks 0-7 on CPUs 24-31 and using GPU 0.

Identify the purpose of CUDA Stream debugging: The purpose of CUDA Stream debugging is to debug and optimize the performance of GPU kernels.\n\nBased on the context, it appears that the program is running a kernel called \"triad_kernel\" which is performing some computation involving arrays `a`, `b`, and `c`. The debugger is stopped at line 203 of the kernel code, where an assignment operation is being performed.\n\nThe output shows various performance metrics for different operations (copy, multiply, add, triad, dot) along with their respective times.

This guide details the use of containers on Polaris, including custom container creation, large-scale execution, and common pitfalls.\n\nApptainer Setup\n\nPolaris employs Apptainer (formerly known as Singularity) for container management.

Detailed user documentation is available here\n\nBuilding from Docker or Argonne GitHub Container Registry\n\nContainers on Polaris can be built by writing Dockerfiles on a local machine and then publish the container to DockerHub, or by directly building them on ALCF compute node by writing an Apptainer recipe file. If you prefer to use existing containers, you can pull them from various registries like DockerHub and run them on Polaris.\n\nSince Docker requires root privileges, which users do not have on Polaris, existing Docker containers must be converted to Apptainer.

Developers can optimize bottlenecks to scale efficiently across any number or size of CPUs and GPUs on Polaris. For further optimizations to compute kernels developers should use Nsight Compute.\n\nThe NVIDIA Nsight Compute is an interactive kernel profiler for CUDA applications. It provides detailed performance metrics and API debugging via a user interface and command line tool.\n\nIn addition, the baseline feature of this tool allows users to compare results within the tool. NVIDIA Nsight Compute provides a customizable and data-driven user interface,  metric collection, and can be extended with analysis scripts for post-processing results.\n\nStep-by-step guide\n\nCommon part on Polaris\n\nBuild your application for Polaris, and then submit your job script to Polaris or start an interactive job mode on Polaris as follows:\n\n```\n$ qsub -I -l select=1 -l walltime=1:00:00 -l filesystems=home:eagle -q debug -A\n\n$ module li\n\nCurrently Loaded Modules:\n  1) nvhpc/23.9          5) cray-pmi/6.1.13      9) PrgEnv-nvhpc/8.5.0      13) darshan/3.4.4\n  2) craype/2.7.30       6) cray-pals/1.3.4     10) libfabric/1.15.2.0\n  3) cray-dsmml/0.2.2    7) cray-libpals/1.3.4  11) craype-network-ofi\n  4) cray-mpich/8.1.28   8) craype-x86-milan    12) perftools-base/23.12.0",

This enables developers to debug applications without the potential variations introduced by simulation and emulation environments.\n\nStep-by-step guide\n\nDebug Compilation\n\nNVCC, the NVIDIA CUDA compiler driver, provides a mechanism for generating the debugging information necessary for CUDA-GDB to work properly. The -g -G option pair must be passed to NVCC when an application is compiled for ease of debugging with CUDA-GDB; for example,\nnvcc -g -G foo.cu -o foo\nUsing this line to compile the CUDA application foo.cu\n* forces -O0 compilation, with the exception of very limited dead-code eliminations and register-spilling optimizations.\n* makes the compiler include debug information in the executable\n\nRunning CUDA-gdb on Polaris compute nodes\n\nStart an interactive job mode on Polaris as follows:\n\n```\n$ qsub -I -l select=1 -l walltime=1:00:00"

E.g. if a user submits a script to the prod routing queue requesting 10 nodes for 24 hours, exceeding \"Time Max\" of 6 hrs of the small execution queue (which handles jobs with 10-24 nodes), then it may behave as if the job was never submitted.\n\nJob scripts are copied to temporary locations after qsub and any changes to the original script while the job is queued will not be reflected in the copied script. Furthermore, qalter requires -A <allocation name> when changing job properties. Currently, there is a request for a qalter-like command to trigger a re-copy of the original script to the temporary location.\n\nCompiling & Running Applications\n\nIf your job fails to start with an RPC launch message like below, please forward the complete messages to support@alcf.anl.gov.",

If build your application is problematic for some reason (e.g. absence of a GPU), then users are encouraged to build and test applications directly on one of the Polaris compute nodes via an interactive job. The discussion below makes use of the NVHPC compilers in the default environment as illustrative examples. Similar examples for other compilers on Polaris are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo.\n\nCPU MPI+OpenMP Example\n\nOne of the first useful tasks with any new machine, scheduler, and job launcher is to ensure one is binding MPI ranks and OpenMP threads to the host cpu as intended. A simple HelloWorld MPI+OpenMP example is available here to get started with.\n\nThe application can be straightforwardly compiled using the Cray compiler wrappers.\nCC -fopenmp main.cpp -o hello_affinity\n\nThe executable hello_affinity can then be launched in a job script (or directly in shell of interactive job) using mpiexec as discussed here.\n\n```\n\n!/bin/sh\n\nPBS -l select=1:system=polaris\n\nPBS -l place=scatter\n\nPBS -l walltime=0:30:00\n\nPBS -l filesystems=home\n\nMPI example w/ 16 MPI ranks per node spread evenly across cores\n\nNNODES=wc -l < $PBS_NODEFILE\nNRANKS_PER_NODE=16\nNDEPTH=4\nNTHREADS=1",

In particular, we encourage users to try their scaling measurements with the following settings:\n\nSet the environment variable NCCL_COLLNET_ENABLE=1\n\nSet the environment varialbe NCCL_NET_GDR_LEVEL=PHB\n\nManually set the CPU affinity via mpiexec, such as with --cpu-bind verbose,list:0,8,16,24\n\nHorovod and DDP work best when you limit the visible devices to only one GPU.  Note that if you import mpi4py or horovod, and then do something like os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = hvd.local_rank(), it may not actually work!  You must set the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable prior to doing MPI.COMM_WORLD.init(), which is done in horovod.init() as well as implicitly in from mpi4py import MPI.   On Polaris specifically, you can use the environment variable PMI_LOCAL_RANK (as well as PMI_LOCAL_SIZE) to learn information about the node-local MPI ranks.\n\nDeepSpeed\n\nDeepSpeed is also available and usable on Polaris.  For more information, please see the DeepSpeed documentation directly.\n\nPyTorch DataLoader and multi-node Horovod\n\nPlease note there is a bug that causes a hang when using PyTorch's multithreaded data loaders with distributed training across multiple nodes.

            "Use XLA compilation on your code.  XLA is the Accelerated Linear Algebra library that is available in tensorFlow and critical in software like JAX.  XLA will compile a tf.Graph object, generated with tf.function or similar, and perform optimizations like operation-fusion.  XLA can give impressive performance boosts with almost no user changes except to set an environment variable TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2.  If your code is complex, or has dynamically sized tensors (tensors where the shape changes every iteration), XLA can be detrimental: the overhead for compiling functions can be large enough to mitigate performance improvements.  XLA is particularly powerful when combined with reduced precision, yielding speedups > 100% in some models.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nTensorFlow is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with tensorFlow has been seen with horovod in particular.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation.  Some polaris specific details that may be helpful to you:\n\nCPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.  In particular, we encourage users to try their scaling measurements with the following settings:\n\nSet the environment variable NCCL_COLLNET_ENABLE=1\n\nSet the environment varialbe NCCL_NET_GDR_LEVEL=PHB",

            "TensorFlow Best Practices on Polaris\n\nSingle Node Performance\n\nWhen running TensorFlow applications, we have found the following practices to be generally, if not universally, useful and encourage you to try some of these techniques to boost performance of your own applications.\n\nUse Reduced Precision. Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with TensorFlow operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the tf.keras.mixed_precision Policy, as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  If you use a custom training loop (and not keras.Model.fit), you will also need to apply loss scaling.\n\nUse TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.  Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.  When possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention.",

This enables developers to debug applications without the potential variations introduced by simulation and emulation environments.\n\nStep-by-step guide\n\nDebug Compilation\n\nNVCC, the NVIDIA CUDA compiler driver, provides a mechanism for generating the debugging information necessary for CUDA-GDB to work properly. The -g -G option pair must be passed to NVCC when an application is compiled for ease of debugging with CUDA-GDB; for example,\nnvcc -g -G foo.cu -o foo\nUsing this line to compile the CUDA application foo.cu\n* forces -O0 compilation, with the exception of very limited dead-code eliminations and register-spilling optimizations.\n* makes the compiler include debug information in the executable\n\nRunning CUDA-gdb on Polaris compute nodes\n\nStart an interactive job mode on Polaris as follows:\n\n```\n$ qsub -I -l select=1 -l walltime=1:00:00",

If your build system does require GPUs, you cannot yet compile on the Polaris login nodes, as they do not currently have GPUs installed. You may in this case compile your applications on the Polaris compute nodes. Do this by submitting an interactive single-node job, or running your build system in a batch job.\n\nHome File System\n\nIs it helpful to realize that there is a single HOME filesystem for users that can be accessed from the login and computes of each production resource at ALCF. Thus, users should be mindful of modifications to their environments (e.g. .bashrc) that may cause issues to arise due to differences between the systems.\n\nCray Programming Environment\n\nThe Cray Programming Environment (PE) uses three compiler wrappers for building software.

Accordingly, the software in spack-pe-base can be used\nregardless of programming environment.\n\nspack-pe-gnu is based on the E4S Project and\nprovides performant HPC libraries built with PrgEnv-gnu and the nvcc CUDA\ncompiler driver for GPU code. spack-pe-gnu is dependent on both\nspack-pe-base and PrgEnv-gnu.\n\nUsing software from the Spack PE\n\nThe base suite of software tools and libraries can be accessed by loading the\nspack-pe-base module. This adds a path to $MODULEPATH which contains\nnumerous modules.\n\nFor example, to load cmake starting from the default environment, a user\nshould run the following commands:\nmodule use /soft/modulefiles\nmodule load spack-pe-base\nmodule load cmake\n\nThe spack-pe-base module adds paths to the user's MODULEPATH; individual packages are subsequently loaded through the newly available modules. The full list of available packages can be viewed by running module avail or module --show-hidden avail for a complete listing. Packages are loaded in the same way from spack-pe-gnu.\n\nInspecting packages",

Developers can optimize bottlenecks to scale efficiently across any number or size of CPUs and GPUs on Polaris. For further optimizations to compute kernels developers should use Nsight Compute.\n\nThe NVIDIA Nsight Compute is an interactive kernel profiler for CUDA applications. It provides detailed performance metrics and API debugging via a user interface and command line tool.\n\nIn addition, the baseline feature of this tool allows users to compare results within the tool. NVIDIA Nsight Compute provides a customizable and data-driven user interface,  metric collection, and can be extended with analysis scripts for post-processing results.\n\nStep-by-step guide\n\nCommon part on Polaris\n\nBuild your application for Polaris, and then submit your job script to Polaris or start an interactive job mode on Polaris as follows:\n\n```\n$ qsub -I -l select=1 -l walltime=1:00:00 -l filesystems=home:eagle -q debug -A\n\n$ module li\n\nCurrently Loaded Modules:\n  1) nvhpc/23.9          5) cray-pmi/6.1.13      9) PrgEnv-nvhpc/8.5.0      13) darshan/3.4.4\n  2) craype/2.7.30       6) cray-pals/1.3.4     10) libfabric/1.15.2.0\n  3) cray-dsmml/0.2.2    7) cray-libpals/1.3.4  11) craype-network-ofi\n  4) cray-mpich/8.1.28   8) craype-x86-milan    12) perftools-base/23.12.0",

E.g. if a user submits a script to the prod routing queue requesting 10 nodes for 24 hours, exceeding \"Time Max\" of 6 hrs of the small execution queue (which handles jobs with 10-24 nodes), then it may behave as if the job was never submitted.\n\nJob scripts are copied to temporary locations after qsub and any changes to the original script while the job is queued will not be reflected in the copied script. Furthermore, qalter requires -A <allocation name> when changing job properties.

In the context, we have particles.000* and rbc.000/bad_rbc.000, which are polygonal meshes that make up Red Blood Cells (RBCs). We want to visually distinguish between these two types of RBCs.\n\n##begin_quote##\nLet's hide the particles.000* by toggling them off, by clicking on the Eye icon next to it in the Pipeline Browser.\nLet's also switch to the Display tab in the Object Inspector, with Glyph1 selected, and change the Color by value to GlyphVector. Since the GlyphVector value is based on the velocity.\n##end_quote##\n\nWe can see that we're already using a color map for velocity, which is represented as Blue to Red Rainbow preset. To differentiate between the RBCs, we can apply the same color map to the glyph size of the rbc.000 and bad_rbc.000 data sets.\n\nBy setting different color maps for velocity and glyph size, we're creating a visual distinction between the two types of RBCs, making it easier to understand the simulation's output.\n\n<ANSWER>: The purpose is to differentiate between the particles.000* and rbc.000/bad_rbc.000 data sets by using distinct color maps for velocity and glyph size.",

These functions can portably submit external executables at any scale.\n\nSystem details are detected, and dynamic resource management is provided.

            "Running Multiple MPI Applications on a node\n\nMultiple applications can be run simultaneously on a node by launching several mpiexec commands and backgrounding them. For performance, it will likely be necessary to ensure that each application runs on a distinct set of CPU resources and/or targets specific GPUs. One can provide a list of CPUs using the --cpu-bind option, which when combined with CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES provides a user with specifying exactly which CPU and GPU resources to run each application on. In the example below, four instances of the application are simultaneously running on a single node. In the first instance, the application is spawning MPI ranks 0-7 on CPUs 24-31 and using GPU 0. This mapping is based on output from the nvidia-smi topo -m command and pairs CPUs with the closest GPU.\n\n```bash\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:24:25:26:27:28:29:30:31 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:16:17:18:19:20:21:22:23 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:8:9:10:11:12:13:14:15 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=3\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:0:1:2:3:4:5:6:7 ./hello_affinity &\n\nwait\n```\n\nCompute Node Access to the Internet\n\nCurrently, the only access the internet is via a proxy.

Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with PyTorch operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the PyTorch Automatic Mixed Precision package (AMP), as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  In PyTorch, users generally need to manage casting and loss scaling manually,  though context managers and function decorators can provide easy tools to do this.\n\nPyTorch has a JIT module as well as backends to support op fusion, similar to TensorFlow's tf.function tools.  However, PyTorch JIT capabilities are newer and may not yield performance improvements.  Please see TorchScript for more information.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nPyTorch is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with PyTorch has been seen with both DDP and Horovod.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation or the Distributed Data Parallel documentation.  Some Polaris-specific details that may be helpful to you:",

If build your application is problematic for some reason (e.g. absence of a GPU), then users are encouraged to build and test applications directly on one of the Polaris compute nodes via an interactive job.

            "TensorFlow Best Practices on Polaris\n\nSingle Node Performance\n\nWhen running TensorFlow applications, we have found the following practices to be generally, if not universally, useful and encourage you to try some of these techniques to boost performance of your own applications.\n\nUse Reduced Precision. Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with TensorFlow operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the tf.keras.mixed_precision Policy, as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  If you use a custom training loop (and not keras.Model.fit), you will also need to apply loss scaling.\n\nUse TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.  Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.  When possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention.",

            "Use XLA compilation on your code.  XLA is the Accelerated Linear Algebra library that is available in tensorFlow and critical in software like JAX.  XLA will compile a tf.Graph object, generated with tf.function or similar, and perform optimizations like operation-fusion.  XLA can give impressive performance boosts with almost no user changes except to set an environment variable TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2.  If your code is complex, or has dynamically sized tensors (tensors where the shape changes every iteration), XLA can be detrimental: the overhead for compiling functions can be large enough to mitigate performance improvements.  XLA is particularly powerful when combined with reduced precision, yielding speedups > 100% in some models.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nTensorFlow is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with tensorFlow has been seen with horovod in particular.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation.  Some polaris specific details that may be helpful to you:\n\nCPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.  In particular, we encourage users to try their scaling measurements with the following settings:\n\nSet the environment variable NCCL_COLLNET_ENABLE=1\n\nSet the environment varialbe NCCL_NET_GDR_LEVEL=PHB",

In this case, it will be important to have the craype-accel-nvidia80 module loaded both when compiling your application and during runtime to correctly link against a GPU Transport Layer (GTL) MPI library. Otherwise, you'll likely see GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED is requested, but GTL library is not linked errors during runtime.\n- If running on a specific GPU or subset of GPUs is desired, then the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable can be used. For example, if one only wanted an application to access the first two GPUs on a node, then setting CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 could be used.\n\nBinding MPI ranks to GPUs\n\nThe Cray MPI on Polaris does not currently support binding MPI ranks to GPUs. For applications that need this support, this instead can be handled by use of a small helper script that will appropriately set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES for each MPI rank. One example is available here where each MPI rank is similarly bound to a single GPU with round-robin assignment.\n\nA example set_affinity_gpu_polaris.sh script follows where GPUs are assigned round-robin to MPI ranks.\n\n```bash\n\n!/bin/bash -l\n\nnum_gpus=4\n\nneed to assign GPUs in reverse order due to topology",

The only relevant sentence is:\n\n```\nExample (using GPU-aware MPI)\n```\n\nThis suggests that MPI is being used in this context, specifically with GPU-aware MPI, which implies that it is being used to perform computations on a cluster of nodes with NVIDIA GPUs.\n\nFinally, I will analyze the example code provided, which shows the use of MPI commands such as `mpicxx` and `mpiexec`.

            "Use XLA compilation on your code.  XLA is the Accelerated Linear Algebra library that is available in tensorFlow and critical in software like JAX.  XLA will compile a tf.Graph object, generated with tf.function or similar, and perform optimizations like operation-fusion.  XLA can give impressive performance boosts with almost no user changes except to set an environment variable TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2.  If your code is complex, or has dynamically sized tensors (tensors where the shape changes every iteration), XLA can be detrimental: the overhead for compiling functions can be large enough to mitigate performance improvements.  XLA is particularly powerful when combined with reduced precision, yielding speedups > 100% in some models.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nTensorFlow is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with tensorFlow has been seen with horovod in particular.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation.

        "question": "Which libraries are required to compile and run this program?",
        "cot_answer": "To answer this question, I will break down the required libraries step by step.\n\n1. The program uses `delete[]` to free memory allocated using `new[]`. This suggests that the program is using C++'s standard library for dynamic memory allocation.\n2. The program also uses `sycl::free()` to free SYCL buffers. This requires the SYCL library, which is part of the OpenCL framework.\n3. The program mentions `C_cblas` and `C_host_onemkl`, which are likely C++ classes or objects that use the BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) and MKL (Math Kernel Library) libraries, respectively.\n\nBased on these observations, I can conclude that the required libraries are:\n\n* C++ standard library (`libstdc++.so` or equivalent)\n* SYCL library (`libsycl.so` or equivalent)\n* BLAS library (`libblas.so` or equivalent)\n* MKL library (`libmkl.so` or equivalent)\n\nTo compile and run this program, you would need to link against these libraries.

This is because the `sycl::free` and `delete[]` statements are used to manage memory on the device, which requires the kernel to be compiled for a specific target backend.\n\nThe presence of this option also implies that the code will use the CUDA runtime to execute the SYCL kernels on the NVIDIA GPU.\n\n##begin_quote##\nCompile and Run\nThe user would need to provide paths the math-libraris as shown below.

Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with TensorFlow operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the tf.keras.mixed_precision Policy, as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  If you use a custom training loop (and not keras.Model.fit), you will also need to apply loss scaling.\n\nUse TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.  Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.  When possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention."

In this case, it will be important to have the craype-accel-nvidia80 module loaded both when compiling your application and during runtime to correctly link against a GPU Transport Layer (GTL) MPI library. Otherwise, you'll likely see GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED is requested, but GTL library is not linked errors during runtime.\n- If running on a specific GPU or subset of GPUs is desired, then the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable can be used. For example, if one only wanted an application to access the first two GPUs on a node, then setting CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 could be used.\n\nBinding MPI ranks to GPUs\n\nThe Cray MPI on Polaris does not currently support binding MPI ranks to GPUs. For applications that need this support, this instead can be handled by use of a small helper script that will appropriately set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES for each MPI rank. One example is available here where each MPI rank is similarly bound to a single GPU with round-robin assignment.\n\nA example set_affinity_gpu_polaris.sh script follows where GPUs are assigned round-robin to MPI ranks.\n\n```bash\n\n!/bin/bash -l\n\nnum_gpus=4\n\nneed to assign GPUs in reverse order due to topology",

Users building cpu-only applications may find it useful to unload this module to silence \"gpu code generation\" warnings.\n\nMixed C/C++ & Fortran Applications\n\nFor applications consisting of a mix of C/C++ and Fortran that also uses MPI, it is suggested that the programming environment chosen for Fortran be used to build the full application because of mpi.mod (and similar) incompatibilities.\n\nCompiling for GPUs",

If this is sufficient for your needs, excellent.  If not, another alternative is to use the newer package mpi4jax.\n\nmpi4Jax is a relatively new project and requires setting some environment variables for good performance and usability:\n- Set MPI4JAX_USE_CUDA_MPI=1 to use CUDA-Aware MPI, supported in the conda module, to do operations directly from the GPU.\n- Set MPICH_GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED=1 to use CUDA-Aware MPI.\n\nThe following code, based off of a test script from the mpi4jax repository, can help you verify you are using mpi4jax properly:\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom mpi4py import MPI\nimport jax\nimport jax.numpy as jnp\nimport mpi4jax\n\ncomm = MPI.COMM_WORLD\nrank = comm.Get_rank()\nlocal_rank = int(os.environ[\"PMI_LOCAL_RANK\"])\n\navailable_devices = jax.devices(\"gpu\")\nif len(available_devices) <= local_rank:\n    raise Exception(\"Could not find enough GPUs\")\n\ntarget_device = available_devices[local_rank]\n\n@jax.jit\ndef foo(arr):\n   arr = arr + rank\n   arr_sum, _ = mpi4jax.allreduce(arr, op=MPI.SUM, comm=comm)\n   return arr_sum",

        "question": "How many processes are required to run this program?",
        "cot_answer": "To answer this question, we need to analyze the OpenMP code provided in the context. The key line is `write(,) \"Number of devices:\", omp_get_num_devices()`. This line prints the number of devices available for parallel processing.\n\nThe reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. The program uses OpenMP directives to create a target region.\n2. Inside this target region, there's an if-else statement that checks whether the current device is the initial device or not.\n3. If it's not the initial device, `flag` is set to 1; otherwise, it's set to 0.\n4. The program then prints a message depending on the value of `flag`.\n\nNow, let's analyze the output:\n\n* When running with `mpiexec -n 1 ./c_test`, we see that the number of devices is 4 and the message printed is \"Hello world from accelerator\".\n* Similarly, when running with `mpiexec -n 1 ./f_test`, we also get 4 devices and the same message.\n\nFrom this analysis, we can conclude that the program requires **4 processes** to run. This is because OpenMP creates a team of threads, and each thread represents a process. In this case, there are 4 processes (devices) participating in parallel processing.\n\n<ANSWER>: 4",
