We encourage you to engage with the parsl community for support with parsl specific questions, and for Polaris-specific questions or problems, please contact support@alcf.anl.gov.\n\nGetting Parsl on Polaris\n\nYou can install parsl building off of the conda modules.  You have some flexibility in how you want to extend the conda module to include parsl, but here is an example way to do it:\n\n```python\n\nLoad the Conda Module (needed everytime you use parsl)\n\nmodule load conda\nconda activate\n\nCreate a virtual env that uses the conda env as the system packages.\n\nOnly do the next line on initial set up:\n\npython -m venv --system-site-packages /path/to/your/virtualenv\n\nLoad the virtual env (every time):\n\nsource /path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/activate\n\nInstall parsl (only once)\n\npip install parsl\n\n```\n\nUsing Parsl on Polaris\n\nParsl has a variety of possible configuration settings.  As an example, we provide the configuration below that will run one task per GPU:\n\n```python\nfrom parsl.config import Config\n\nPBSPro is the right provider for Polaris:\n\nfrom parsl.providers import PBSProProvider\n\nThe high throughput executor is for scaling to HPC systems:\n\nfrom parsl.executors import HighThroughputExecutor\n\nYou can use the MPI launcher, but may want the Gnu Parallel launcher, see below\n\nfrom parsl.launchers import MpiExecLauncher, GnuParallelLauncher\n\naddress_by_interface is needed for the HighThroughputExecutor:",

CUDA-GDB is an extension to GDB, the GNU Project debugger. The tool provides developers with a mechanism for debugging CUDA applications running on actual hardware. This enables developers to debug applications without the potential variations introduced by simulation and emulation environments.\n\nStep-by-step guide\n\nDebug Compilation\n\nNVCC, the NVIDIA CUDA compiler driver, provides a mechanism for generating the debugging information necessary for CUDA-GDB to work properly. The -g -G option pair must be passed to NVCC when an application is compiled for ease of debugging with CUDA-GDB; for example,\nnvcc -g -G foo.cu -o foo\nUsing this line to compile the CUDA application foo.cu\n* forces -O0 compilation, with the exception of very limited dead-code eliminations and register-spilling optimizations.\n* makes the compiler include debug information in the executable\n\nRunning CUDA-gdb on Polaris compute nodes\n\nStart an interactive job mode on Polaris as follows:\n\n```\n$ qsub -I -l select=1 -l walltime=1:00:00\n\n$ cuda-gdb --version\nNVIDIA (R) CUDA Debugger\n11.4 release\nPortions Copyright (C) 2007-2021 NVIDIA Corporation\nGNU gdb (GDB) 10.1\nCopyright (C) 2020 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nLicense GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html\nThis is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.\nThere is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.\n\n$ cuda-gdb foo\n```\n\nA quick example with a stream benchmark on a Polaris compute node\n\n```\njkwack@polaris-login-02:~> qsub -I -l select=1 -l walltime=1:00:00\nqsub: waiting for job 308834.polaris-pbs-01.hsn.cm.polaris.alcf.anl.gov to start\nqsub: job 308834.polaris-pbs-01.hsn.cm.polaris.alcf.anl.gov ready",

                "Compiling and Linking Overview on Polaris\n\nCompiling on Polaris Login and Compute Nodes\n\nIf your build system does not require GPUs for the build process, as is usually the case, compilation of GPU-accelerated codes is generally expected to work well on the Polaris login nodes. If your build system does require GPUs, you cannot yet compile on the Polaris login nodes, as they do not currently have GPUs installed. You may in this case compile your applications on the Polaris compute nodes. Do this by submitting an interactive single-node job, or running your build system in a batch job.\n\nHome File System\n\nIs it helpful to realize that there is a single HOME filesystem for users that can be accessed from the login and computes of each production resource at ALCF. Thus, users should be mindful of modifications to their environments (e.g. .bashrc) that may cause issues to arise due to differences between the systems.\n\nCray Programming Environment\n\nThe Cray Programming Environment (PE) uses three compiler wrappers for building software. These compiler wrappers should be used when building MPI-enabled applications.\n\ncc - C compiler\n\nCC - C++ compiler\n\nftn - Fortran compiler\n\nEach of these wrappers can select a specific vendor compiler based on the PrgEnv module loaded in the environment. The following are some helpful options to understand what the compiler wrapper is invoking.\n\n--craype-verbose : Print the command which is forwarded to the compiler invocation\n\n--cray-print-opts=libs : Print library information\n\n--cray-print-opts=cflags : Print include information\n\nThe output from these commands may be useful in build scripts where a compiler other than that invoked by a compiler wrapper is desired. Defining some variables as such may prove useful in those situations.\nCRAY_CFLAGS=$(cc --cray-print-opts=cflags)\nCRAY_LIB=$(cc --cray-print-opts=libs)\nFurther documentation and options are available via man cc and similar.\n\nCompilers provided by Cray Programming Environments",

The GNU compilers are available via another programming environment. The following sequence of module commands can be used to switch to the GNU programming environment (gcc, g++, gfortran) and also have NVIDIA compilers available in your path.\n\nmodule swap PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-gnu\nmodule load nvhpc-mixed\n\nThe compilers invoked by the Cray MPI wrappers are listed for each programming environment in the following table.\n\nmodule C C++ Fortran MPI Compiler Wrapper cc CC ftn PrgEnv-nvhpc nvc nvc++ nvfortran PrgEnv-gnu gcc g++ gfortran\n\nNote, while gcc and g++ may be available in the default environment, the PrgEnv-gnu module is needed to provide gfortran.\n\nAdditional Compilers Provided by ALCF\n\nThe ALCF additionally provides compilers to enable the OpenMP and SYCL programming models for GPUs viaLLVM as documented here\n\nAdditional documentation for using compilers is available on the respective programming model pages: OpenMP and SYCL.\n\nLinking\n\nDynamic linking of libraries is currently the default on Polaris. The Cray MPI wrappers will handle this automatically.\n\nNotes on Default Modules\n\ncraype-x86-rome: While the Polaris compute nodes currently have Milan CPUs, this module is loaded by default to avoid the craype-x86-milan module from adding a zen3 target not supported in the default nvhpc/21.9 compilers. The craype-x86-milan module is expected to be made default once a newer nvhpc version (e.g. 22.5) is made the default.\n\ncraype-accel-nvidia80: This module adds compiler flags to enable GPU acceleration for NVHPC compilers along with gpu-enabled MPI libraries as it is assumed that the majority of applications to be compiled on Polaris will target the GPUs for acceleration. Users building cpu-only applications may find it useful to unload this module to silence \"gpu code generation\" warnings.\n\nMixed C/C++ & Fortran Applications",

Users are encouraged to email support@alcf.anl.gov to report issues.\n\nSubmitting Jobs\n\nFor batch job submissions, if the parameters within your submission script do not meet the parameters of any of the execution queues (small, ..., backfill-large) you might not receive the \"Job submission\" error on the command line at all, and the job will never appear in history qstat -xu <username> (current bug in PBS). E.g. if a user submits a script to the prod routing queue requesting 10 nodes for 24 hours, exceeding \"Time Max\" of 6 hrs of the small execution queue (which handles jobs with 10-24 nodes), then it may behave as if the job was never submitted.\n\nJob scripts are copied to temporary locations after qsub and any changes to the original script while the job is queued will not be reflected in the copied script. Furthermore, qalter requires -A <allocation name> when changing job properties. Currently, there is a request for a qalter-like command to trigger a re-copy of the original script to the temporary location.\n\nCompiling & Running Applications\n\nIf your job fails to start with an RPC launch message like below, please forward the complete messages to support@alcf.anl.gov.\n\nbash\n   launch failed on x3104c0s1b0n0: Couldn't forward RPC launch(ab751d77-e80a-4c54-b1c2-4e881f7e8c90) to child x3104c0s31b0n0.hsn.cm.polaris.alcf.anl.gov: Resource temporarily unavailable",

                "OpenMP\n\nOverview\n\nThe OpenMP API is an open standard for parallel programming. The specification document can be found here: https://www.openmp.org. The specification describes directives, runtime routines, and environment variables that allow an application developer to express parallelism (e.g. shared memory multiprocessing and device offloading). Many compiler vendors provide implementations of the OpenMP specification (https://www.openmp.org/specifications).\n\nSetting the environment to use OpenMP on Polaris\n\nMany of the programming environments available on Polaris have OpenMP support.\n\nmodule OpenMP CPU support? OpenMP GPU support? PrgEnv-nvhpc yes yes llvm yes yes PrgEnv-gnu yes no PrgEnv-cray yes yes*\n\nCurrently PrgEnv-cray is not recommended for OpenMP offload.\n\nBy default, the PrgEnv-nvhpc module is loaded. To switch to other modules, you can use module switch.\n\nUsing PrgEnv-nvhpc\n\nThis is loaded by default, so there's no need to load additional modules. You can confirm that it is loaded by running module list to check that PrgEnv-nvhpc is in the list.\n\nUsing LLVM\n\nTo use the LLVM module, load the following.\nmodule load mpiwrappers/cray-mpich-llvm\nmodule load cudatoolkit-standalone\n\nSee the the LLVM compiling page here for more information.\n\nUsing PrgEnv-gnu\n\nTo switch from PrgEnv-nvhpc to PrgEnv-gnu you can run:\n\nmodule switch PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-gnu\n\nThe gcc/gfortran on Polaris was not built with GPU support. To use OpenMP on the CPU, you need to unload craype-accel-nvidia80:\n\nmodule unload craype-accel-nvidia80\n\nUsing PrgEnv-cray\n\nTo switch from PrgEnv-nvhpc to PrgEnv-cray you can run:\n\nmodule switch PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-cray\n\nTo use OpenMP on the CPU only, also unload craype-accel-nvidia80:\n\nmodule unload craype-accel-nvidia80\n\nTo use OpenMP on the GPU, load cudatoolkit-standalone, although this is not recommended at the moment.\nmodule load cudatoolkit-standalone\n\nBuilding on Polaris",

The latter shows hidden modules which are\ninstalled as dependencies of the un-hidden modules.\n\nIn addition to the base stack, a suite of higher-level libraries are installed\nin the spack-pe-gnu module. These are built with and are dependent on\nPrgEnv-gnu. A PrgEnv-nvidia-compatible stack will be available in the\nfuture.\n\nNote that not all software is installed through Spack; many applications and\nlibraries are installed as standalone packages in /soft.

The reason for this is that the demand queue takes priority over the preemptable queue, which means that jobs in the preemptable queue may be killed without warning if there are jobs in the demand queue.\n\nFinal Answer:\n<ANSWER>: Yes, it is possible to preempt jobs in the preemptable queue, and it happens when jobs are submitted to the demand queue."

It consists of a base stack (spack-pe-base)\nand PrgEnv-dependent stacks (currently spack-pe-gnu).\n\nspack-pe-base contains commonplace software compiled for CPU with the system\nGCC compilers. Accordingly, the software in spack-pe-base can be used\nregardless of programming environment.\n\nspack-pe-gnu is based on the E4S Project and\nprovides performant HPC libraries built with PrgEnv-gnu and the nvcc CUDA\ncompiler driver for GPU code. spack-pe-gnu is dependent on both\nspack-pe-base and PrgEnv-gnu.\n\nUsing software from the Spack PE\n\nThe base suite of software tools and libraries can be accessed by loading the\nspack-pe-base module. This adds a path to $MODULEPATH which contains\nnumerous modules.\n\nFor example, to load cmake starting from the default environment, a user\nshould run the following commands:\nmodule use /soft/modulefiles\nmodule load spack-pe-base\nmodule load cmake\n\nThe spack-pe-base module adds paths to the user's MODULEPATH; individual packages are subsequently loaded through the newly available modules. The full list of available packages can be viewed by running module avail or module --show-hidden avail for a complete listing. Packages are loaded in the same way from spack-pe-gnu.\n\nInspecting packages\n\nWhen a module in the Spack PE is loaded, several environment variables are\nupdated to integrate the package into the user's environment. Additionally, the\nPACKAGE_ROOT variable is set to the path to the installation prefix of the\npackage. For example, after loading cmake as above:\n\n$ echo $CMAKE_ROOT\n/soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/install/linux-sles15-x86_64/gcc-12.3.0/cmake-3.27.7-a435jtzvweeos2es6enirbxdjdqhqgdp/\n$ ls -a $CMAKE_ROOT\n.  ..  bin  doc  share  .spack",

Determine the number of GPUs per node and the total number of nodes: `num_gpus` and `ntotrank` respectively.\n2. Calculate the GPU index for each MPI rank using the formula: `$((num_gpus - 1 - PMI_LOCAL_RANK % num_gpus))`. This ensures that each rank gets a unique GPU assignment.\n3. Set the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable to the calculated GPU index: `export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=$gpu`.\n4. Verify the GPU assignment for each rank by printing out the rank, local rank, and assigned GPU.\n\nThe script provided in the context does exactly this:\n```bash\ngpu=$((${num_gpus} - 1 - ${PMI_LOCAL_RANK} % ${num_gpus}))\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=$gpu\necho “RANK= ${PMI_RANK} LOCAL_RANK= ${PMI_LOCAL_RANK} gpu= ${gpu}”\nexec \"$@\"\n```\nThis script can be placed just before the executable in the `mpiexec` command.\n\n<ANSWER>: Use a script like the one provided to assign GPUs for MPI applications on Polaris."

Determine the node numbers within the rack: Since there are 14 nodes per rack, we need to find out which nodes we want to specify. For example, if we want nodes 1 and 13, we would use the corresponding node names in our PBS job submission command.\n\n3.

In general, the way to do this is via the PyTorch Automatic Mixed Precision package (AMP), as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  In PyTorch, users generally need to manage casting and loss scaling manually,  though context managers and function decorators can provide easy tools to do this.\n\nPyTorch has a JIT module as well as backends to support op fusion, similar to TensorFlow's tf.function tools.  However, PyTorch JIT capabilities are newer and may not yield performance improvements.  Please see TorchScript for more information.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nPyTorch is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with PyTorch has been seen with both DDP and Horovod.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation or the Distributed Data Parallel documentation.  Some Polaris-specific details that may be helpful to you:\n\nCPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.  In particular, we encourage users to try their scaling measurements with the following settings:\n\nSet the environment variable NCCL_COLLNET_ENABLE=1\n\nSet the environment varialbe NCCL_NET_GDR_LEVEL=PHB\n\nManually set the CPU affinity via mpiexec, such as with --cpu-bind verbose,list:0,8,16,24",

For questions, contact us at support@alcf.anl.gov.\n\nBuilding Gromacs\n\nDownload latest source code: http://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/2022.1/download.html\n\ntar -xzf gromacs-2022.1.tar.gz\n\nmodule swap PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-gnu\n\nmodule load cudatoolkit-standalone/11.2.2\n\nmodule load gcc/10.3.0\n\nmodule load cmake\n\ncd gromacs-2022.1\n\nmkdir build\n\ncmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=cc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=CC \\\n      -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -DGMX_BUILD_OWN_FFTW=ON \\\n      -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path-to/gromacs-2022.1/build \\\n      -DGMX_MPI=ON -DGMX_OPENMP=ON -DGMX_GPU=CUDA \\\n      -DCUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR=/soft/compilers/cudatoolkit/cuda-11.2.2\n\nmake –j 8\n\nmake install\n\nThe installed binary is build/bin/gmx_mpi.\n\nRunning Gromacs on Polaris\n\nPrebuilt Gromacs binaries can be found in the directory /soft/applications/Gromacs/gromacs-2022.1.\n\nA sample pbs script follows that will run GROMACS on two nodes, using 4 MPI ranks per node, and each rank with four OpenMP threads. The PME kernel owns one MPI rank and one GPU per node, while the nonbonded kernel uses 3 MPI ranks and 3 GPUs per node.\n\n```\n\n!/bin/sh\n\nPBS -l select=2:system=polaris\n\nPBS -l place=scatter\n\nPBS -l walltime=0:30:00\n\nPBS -q debug\n\nPBS -A PROJECT\n\nPBS -l filesystems=home:grand:eagle\n\ncd ${PBS_O_WORKDIR}",

                "Use Reduced Precision. Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with PyTorch operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the PyTorch Automatic Mixed Precision package (AMP), as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  In PyTorch, users generally need to manage casting and loss scaling manually,  though context managers and function decorators can provide easy tools to do this.\n\nPyTorch has a JIT module as well as backends to support op fusion, similar to TensorFlow's tf.function tools.  However, PyTorch JIT capabilities are newer and may not yield performance improvements.  Please see TorchScript for more information.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nPyTorch is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with PyTorch has been seen with both DDP and Horovod.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation or the Distributed Data Parallel documentation.  Some Polaris-specific details that may be helpful to you:\n\nCPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.  In particular, we encourage users to try their scaling measurements with the following settings:\n\nSet the environment variable NCCL_COLLNET_ENABLE=1\n\nSet the environment varialbe NCCL_NET_GDR_LEVEL=PHB\n\nManually set the CPU affinity via mpiexec, such as with --cpu-bind verbose,list:0,8,16,24",

All\nALCF-managed software is accessible to users via modules.\n\nThe base suite of software tools and libraries can be accessed by loading the\nspack-pe-base module. This adds a path to $MODULEPATH which contains\nnumerous modules.\n\nFor example, to load cmake starting from the default environment, a user\nshould run the following commands:\nmodule use /soft/modulefiles\nmodule load spack-pe-base\nmodule load cmake\nOther modules in spack-pe-base can be browsed by running module avail or\nmodule --show-hidden avail. The latter shows hidden modules which are\ninstalled as dependencies of the un-hidden modules.\n\nIn addition to the base stack, a suite of higher-level libraries are installed\nin the spack-pe-gnu module. These are built with and are dependent on\nPrgEnv-gnu. A PrgEnv-nvidia-compatible stack will be available in the\nfuture.\n\nNote that not all software is installed through Spack; many applications and\nlibraries are installed as standalone packages in /soft.

Variational Monte Carlo (VMC), diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) and a number of other advanced QMC algorithms are implemented. Orbital space auxiliary field QMC (AFQMC) has recently been added. By directly solving the Schrodinger equation, QMC methods offer greater accuracy than methods such as density functional theory, but at a trade-off of much greater computational expense.\n\nPrebuilt executables are provided at /soft/applications/qmcpack.\nThe directory of each installation also includes a job submission script example qmcpack-polaris.job.\nUpdate build recipe is provided on GitHub.",

Obviously, that gets tedious for large jobs.\n\nIf you want to control the location of a few nodes, for example 2 out of 64, but the rest don't matter, you can do something like this: -l select=1:vnode=<node name1>+1:vnode=<node name2>+62:system=foo\n\nEvery node has a PBS resource called tier0 with a rack identifier and tier1 with a dragonfly group identifieer.  If you want all your nodes grouped in a rack, you can add the group specifier -l select=8:system=foo,place=scatter:group=tier0.  If you wanted everything in the same dragonfly group, replace tier0 with tier1.  Note that you have to also explicitly specify the place when you use group.  If you wanted a specific rack or dragonfly group instead of any of them, you are back to the select: -l select 10:tier0=x3001-g0.\n\nNetwork: Rack and Dragonfly Group Mappings\n\nRacks contain (7) 6U chassis; each chassis has 2 nodes for 14 nodes per rack\n\nThe hostnames are of the form xRRPPc0sUUb[0|1]n0 where:\nRR is the row {30, 31, 32}\nPP is the position in the row {30 goes 1-16, 31 and 32 go 1-12}\nc is chassis and is always 0\ns stands for slot, but in this case is the RU in the rack and values are {1,7,13,19,25,31,37}\nb is BMC controller and is 0 or 1 (each node has its own BMC)\nn is node, but is always 0 since there is only one node per BMC\n\nSo, 16+12+12 = 40 racks * 14 nodes per rack = 560 nodes.\n\nNote that in production group 9 (the last 4 racks) will be the designated on-demand racks\n\nThe management racks are x3000 and X3100 and are dragonfly group 10\n\nThe TDS rack is x3200 and is dragonfly group 11",

For example, the -cuda flag instructs nvcc to compile .cu input files to .cu.cpp.ii output files which are to be separately compiled, whereas the same -cuda flag instructs nvc, nvc++, and nvfortran to enable CUDA C/C++ or CUDA Fortran code generation. The resulting output file in each case is different (text vs. object) and one may see unrecognized format error when -cuda is incorrectly passed to nvcc.\n\nKnown Issues and Workarounds\n\nIf you are using nvcc to invoke nvc++ and compiling C++17 code, and are seeing the following warning and unable to compile C++17 constructs:\n\n```\npolaris-login-01(~)> nvcc --std=c++17 -ccbin nvc++ ~/smalltests/bool_constant.cpp\nnvcc warning : The -std=c++17 flag is not supported with the configured host compiler.

It is primarily designed for biochemical molecules like proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids that have a lot of complicated bonded interactions, but since GROMACS is extremely fast at calculating the nonbonded interactions (that usually dominate simulations) many groups are also using it for research on non-biological systems, e.g. polymers.\n\nUsing GROMACS at ALCF\n\nALCF offers assistance with building binaries and compiling instructions for GROMACS.

Existing binaries are unlikely to run successfully.\n\nWe have held all jobs submitted prior to the upgrade as a user hold. Users may release their existing jobs with qrls to run after they have rebuilt their binaries.\n\nPBS does cache the job execution script.  If a change to the script is required due to a path changing post rebuild, the job will have to be resubmitted.\n\nAll application binaries should be rebuilt prior to further job submissions.\n\nRe-building user codes\n\nMany user codes will need to be re-built and/or re-linked against the newer version of the programming environment (23.12) and Spack provided dependencies.\n\nChanges to the user software environment\n\nIn addition to the system upgrades, several changes have been made to the user\nsoftware environment which may impact user workflows.\n\nOlder PE versions removed\n\nOlder versions of the Cray PE (older than 23.12) are deprecated as they are incompatible with the\nupgraded system stack and are no longer available for use.\n\nDatascience Anaconda Module Updates",

For this reason, it is recommended to use start_method=\"spawn\" on Polaris when using the MpiExecLauncher as is shown in the example config above.  Alternatively, another solution is to use the GNUParallelLauncher which uses GNU Parallel to spawn processes.  GNU Parallel can be loaded in your environment with the command module load gnu-parallel.  Both of these approaches will circumvent the hang issue from using fork.\n\nUpdates\n\nFor parsl versions after July 2023, the address passed in the HighThroughputExecutor needs to be set to address = address_by_interface(\"bond0\").  With parsl versions prior to July 2023, it was recommended to use address = address_by_hostname() on Polaris, but with later versions this will not work on Polaris (or any other machine).",

Select the \"triad_kernel\" from the list of available streams.\n3. Click on the \"Run Benchmark\" button to start the benchmarking process.\n\nOnce the benchmark is running, Nsight Compute will collect and analyze data related to the stream's performance, such as memory usage, CPU utilization, and GPU activity.\n\n4. After the benchmark has completed, review the results in the GUI to gain insights into the stream's performance characteristics.\n\nBased on these steps, I conclude that the stream benchmark with Nsight Compute for triad_kernel works by running a benchmarking process through the GUI, which collects and analyzes data related to the stream's performance.\n\n<ANSWER>: The stream benchmark with Nsight Compute for triad_kernel works by running a benchmarking process through the GUI, collecting and analyzing data related to the stream's performance."

                "Spack PE\n\nSpack is an HPC-oriented package manager which ALCF uses to install software for\nthe user environment.\n\nALCF's Spack PE is a Spack-managed software stack which provides various build\ntools, utilities, and libraries. It consists of a base stack (spack-pe-base)\nand PrgEnv-dependent stacks (currently spack-pe-gnu).\n\nspack-pe-base contains commonplace software compiled for CPU with the system\nGCC compilers. Accordingly, the software in spack-pe-base can be used\nregardless of programming environment.\n\nspack-pe-gnu is based on the E4S Project and\nprovides performant HPC libraries built with PrgEnv-gnu and the nvcc CUDA\ncompiler driver for GPU code. spack-pe-gnu is dependent on both\nspack-pe-base and PrgEnv-gnu.\n\nUsing software from the Spack PE\n\nThe base suite of software tools and libraries can be accessed by loading the\nspack-pe-base module. This adds a path to $MODULEPATH which contains\nnumerous modules.\n\nFor example, to load cmake starting from the default environment, a user\nshould run the following commands:\nmodule use /soft/modulefiles\nmodule load spack-pe-base\nmodule load cmake\n\nThe spack-pe-base module adds paths to the user's MODULEPATH; individual packages are subsequently loaded through the newly available modules. The full list of available packages can be viewed by running module avail or module --show-hidden avail for a complete listing. Packages are loaded in the same way from spack-pe-gnu.\n\nInspecting packages\n\nWhen a module in the Spack PE is loaded, several environment variables are\nupdated to integrate the package into the user's environment. Additionally, the\nPACKAGE_ROOT variable is set to the path to the installation prefix of the\npackage. For example, after loading cmake as above:\n\n$ echo $CMAKE_ROOT\n/soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/install/linux-sles15-x86_64/gcc-12.3.0/cmake-3.27.7-a435jtzvweeos2es6enirbxdjdqhqgdp/\n$ ls -a $CMAKE_ROOT\n.  ..  bin  doc  share  .spack",

For this reason, it is recommended to use start_method=\"spawn\" on Polaris when using the MpiExecLauncher as is shown in the example config above.  Alternatively, another solution is to use the GNUParallelLauncher which uses GNU Parallel to spawn processes.  GNU Parallel can be loaded in your environment with the command module load gnu-parallel.  Both of these approaches will circumvent the hang issue from using fork.\n\nUpdates\n\nFor parsl versions after July 2023, the address passed in the HighThroughputExecutor needs to be set to address = address_by_interface(\"bond0\").  With parsl versions prior to July 2023, it was recommended to use address = address_by_hostname() on Polaris, but with later versions this will not work on Polaris (or any other machine).",

In this case, it will be important to have the craype-accel-nvidia80 module loaded both when compiling your application and during runtime to correctly link against a GPU Transport Layer (GTL) MPI library. Otherwise, you'll likely see GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED is requested, but GTL library is not linked errors during runtime.\n- If running on a specific GPU or subset of GPUs is desired, then the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable can be used. For example, if one only wanted an application to access the first two GPUs on a node, then setting CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 could be used.\n\nBinding MPI ranks to GPUs\n\nThe Cray MPI on Polaris does not currently support binding MPI ranks to GPUs. For applications that need this support, this instead can be handled by use of a small helper script that will appropriately set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES for each MPI rank. One example is available here where each MPI rank is similarly bound to a single GPU with round-robin assignment.\n\nA example set_affinity_gpu_polaris.sh script follows where GPUs are assigned round-robin to MPI ranks.\n\n```bash\n\n!/bin/bash -l\n\nnum_gpus=4\n\nneed to assign GPUs in reverse order due to topology\n\nSee Polaris Device Affinity Information:\n\nhttps://www.alcf.anl.gov/support/user-guides/polaris/hardware-overview/machine-overview/index.html",

You have some flexibility in how you want to extend the conda module to include parsl, but here is an example way to do it:\n\n```python\n\nLoad the Conda Module (needed everytime you use parsl)\n\nmodule load conda\nconda activate\n\nCreate a virtual env that uses the conda env as the system packages.\n\nOnly do the next line on initial set up:\n\npython -m venv --system-site-packages /path/to/your/virtualenv\n\nLoad the virtual env (every time):\n\nsource /path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/activate\n\nInstall parsl (only once)\n\npip install parsl\n\n```\n\nUsing Parsl on Polaris\n\nParsl has a variety of possible configuration settings.  As an example, we provide the configuration below that will run one task per GPU:\n\n```python\nfrom parsl.config import Config\n\nPBSPro is the right provider for Polaris:\n\nfrom parsl.providers import PBSProProvider\n\nThe high throughput executor is for scaling to HPC systems:\n\nfrom parsl.executors import HighThroughputExecutor\n\nYou can use the MPI launcher, but may want the Gnu Parallel launcher, see below\n\nfrom parsl.launchers import MpiExecLauncher, GnuParallelLauncher\n\naddress_by_interface is needed for the HighThroughputExecutor:",

        "cot_answer": "To determine a system's performance using benchmarking techniques like triad and dot operations, we can analyze the provided context.\n\nThe context shows profiling results for different kernel functions: Copy, Mul, Add, Triad, and Dot. These results provide information about the time taken by each function to complete a certain number of passes (18 in this case).\n\nTo answer the question, let's focus on the importance of benchmarking techniques like triad and dot operations.\n\n##begin_quote##\n==PROF== Profiling \"triad_kernel\": 0%....50%....100% - 18 passes\n==PROF== Profiling \"triad_kernel\": 0%....50%....100% - 18 passes\n...\n==PROF== Report: /home/jkwack/BabelStream/build_polaris/JKreport-ncu_detailed-triad_kernel-BableStream.ncu-rep\n##end_quote##\n\nFrom the context, we can see that the Triad kernel function takes approximately 0.6 seconds to complete one pass (Min = 0.60654 sec, Max = 0.62352 sec, Average = 0.6 1106 sec). This information is crucial in determining the system's performance.\n\nThe dot operation, on the other hand, takes significantly less time to complete a single pass, with an average time of approximately 0.00065 seconds (850376.762 MBytes/sec).\n\nThese benchmarking results provide valuable insights into the system's performance characteristics, such as:\n\n1. **Triad kernel function**: The Triad kernel function is relatively slow compared to other operations, indicating that it might be a bottleneck in the system.\n2. **Dot operation**: The dot operation is much faster than the Triad kernel function, suggesting that it can handle more tasks concurrently without significant performance degradation.\n\nIn conclusion, benchmarking techniques like triad and dot operations are essential in determining a system's performance. By analyzing these results, we can identify potential bottlenecks (e.g., the Triad kernel function) and optimize the system for better performance.\n\n<ANSWER>: The importance of benchmarking techniques like triad and dot operations lies in their ability to provide valuable insights into a system's performance characteristics, allowing for optimization and improvement."

XLA will compile a tf.Graph object, generated with tf.function or similar, and perform optimizations like operation-fusion.  XLA can give impressive performance boosts with almost no user changes except to set an environment variable TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2.  If your code is complex, or has dynamically sized tensors (tensors where the shape changes every iteration), XLA can be detrimental: the overhead for compiling functions can be large enough to mitigate performance improvements.  XLA is particularly powerful when combined with reduced precision, yielding speedups > 100% in some models.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nTensorFlow is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with tensorFlow has been seen with horovod in particular.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation.  Some polaris specific details that may be helpful to you:\n\nCPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.  In particular, we encourage users to try their scaling measurements with the following settings:\n\nSet the environment variable NCCL_COLLNET_ENABLE=1",

Several simple examples for testing the software environment on Polaris for different programming models are available in the ALCF GettingStart repo.\n\nNote, users are encouraged to use PrgEnv-nvhpc instead of PrgEnv-nvidia as the latter will soon be deprecated in Cray's PE.

The Cray MPI wrappers will handle this automatically.\n\nNotes on Default Modules\n\ncraype-x86-rome: While the Polaris compute nodes currently have Milan CPUs, this module is loaded by default to avoid the craype-x86-milan module from adding a zen3 target not supported in the default nvhpc/21.9 compilers. The craype-x86-milan module is expected to be made default once a newer nvhpc version (e.g. 22.5) is made the default.\n\ncraype-accel-nvidia80: This module adds compiler flags to enable GPU acceleration for NVHPC compilers along with gpu-enabled MPI libraries as it is assumed that the majority of applications to be compiled on Polaris will target the GPUs for acceleration. Users building cpu-only applications may find it useful to unload this module to silence \"gpu code generation\" warnings.\n\nMixed C/C++ & Fortran Applications",

It consists of a base stack (spack-pe-base)\nand PrgEnv-dependent stacks (currently spack-pe-gnu).\n\nspack-pe-base contains commonplace software compiled for CPU with the system\nGCC compilers. Accordingly, the software in spack-pe-base can be used\nregardless of programming environment.\n\nspack-pe-gnu is based on the E4S Project and\nprovides performant HPC libraries built with PrgEnv-gnu and the nvcc CUDA\ncompiler driver for GPU code. spack-pe-gnu is dependent on both\nspack-pe-base and PrgEnv-gnu.\n\nUsing software from the Spack PE\n\nThe base suite of software tools and libraries can be accessed by loading the\nspack-pe-base module. This adds a path to $MODULEPATH which contains\nnumerous modules.\n\nFor example, to load cmake starting from the default environment, a user\nshould run the following commands:\nmodule use /soft/modulefiles\nmodule load spack-pe-base\nmodule load cmake\n\nThe spack-pe-base module adds paths to the user's MODULEPATH; individual packages are subsequently loaded through the newly available modules. The full list of available packages can be viewed by running module avail or module --show-hidden avail for a complete listing. Packages are loaded in the same way from spack-pe-gnu.\n\nInspecting packages\n\nWhen a module in the Spack PE is loaded, several environment variables are\nupdated to integrate the package into the user's environment. Additionally, the\nPACKAGE_ROOT variable is set to the path to the installation prefix of the\npackage. For example, after loading cmake as above:\n\n$ echo $CMAKE_ROOT\n/soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/install/linux-sles15-x86_64/gcc-12.3.0/cmake-3.27.7-a435jtzvweeos2es6enirbxdjdqhqgdp/\n$ ls -a $CMAKE_ROOT\n.  ..  bin  doc  share  .spack",

                "Example Programs and Makefiles for Polaris\n\nSeveral simple examples of building CPU and GPU-enabled codes on Polaris are available in the ALCF GettingStart repo for several programming models. If build your application is problematic for some reason (e.g. absence of a GPU), then users are encouraged to build and test applications directly on one of the Polaris compute nodes via an interactive job. The discussion below makes use of the NVHPC compilers in the default environment as illustrative examples. Similar examples for other compilers on Polaris are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo.\n\nCPU MPI+OpenMP Example\n\nOne of the first useful tasks with any new machine, scheduler, and job launcher is to ensure one is binding MPI ranks and OpenMP threads to the host cpu as intended. A simple HelloWorld MPI+OpenMP example is available here to get started with.\n\nThe application can be straightforwardly compiled using the Cray compiler wrappers.\nCC -fopenmp main.cpp -o hello_affinity\n\nThe executable hello_affinity can then be launched in a job script (or directly in shell of interactive job) using mpiexec as discussed here.\n\n```\n\n!/bin/sh\n\nPBS -l select=1:system=polaris\n\nPBS -l place=scatter\n\nPBS -l walltime=0:30:00\n\nPBS -l filesystems=home\n\nMPI example w/ 16 MPI ranks per node spread evenly across cores\n\nNNODES=wc -l < $PBS_NODEFILE\nNRANKS_PER_NODE=16\nNDEPTH=4\nNTHREADS=1\n\nNTOTRANKS=$(( NNODES * NRANKS_PER_NODE ))\necho \"NUM_OF_NODES= ${NNODES} TOTAL_NUM_RANKS= ${NTOTRANKS} RANKS_PER_NODE= ${NRANKS_PER_NODE} THREADS_PER_RANK= ${NTHREADS}\"\n\nmpiexec -n ${NTOTRANKS} --ppn ${NRANKS_PER_NODE} --depth=${NDEPTH} --cpu-bind depth ./hello_affinity\n```\n\nCUDA\n\nSeveral variants of C/C++ and Fortran CUDA examples are available here that include MPI and multi-gpu examples.\n\nOne can use the Cray compiler wrappers to compile GPU-enabled applications as well. This example of simple vector addition uses the NVIDIA compilers.\n\nCC -g -O3 -std=c++0x -cuda main.cpp -o vecadd",

The binding of MPI ranks to GPUs is discussed in more detail here.\n\nGPU OpenCL\n\nA simple OpenCL example is available here.

This is discussed in more detail here: ##begin_quote##The binding of MPI ranks to GPUs is discussed in more detail here.##end_quote##\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, you need to determine how many GPUs are available on your system.\n2. Next, you can use a small helper script to set `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` for each MPI rank. This script will assign each GPU to an MPI rank in a round-robin fashion.\n\nFor example, if you have 4 GPUs and 4 MPI ranks, the script would assign GPU 0 to MPI rank 0, GPU 1 to MPI rank 1, and so on.\n\n3. Finally, you can use `mpiexec` to run your application with the helper script. For example:\n\n```\n$ mpiexec -n 4 ./vecadd\nof devices= 4\nRank 0 running on GPU 0!\nRank 1 running on GPU 1!\nRank 2 running on GPU 2!\nRank 3 running on GPU 3!\nResult is CORRECT!! :)\n```\n\n<ANSWER>: Use a small helper script to set `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` for each MPI rank, and then use `mpiexec` to run your application."

It consists of a base stack (spack-pe-base)\nand PrgEnv-dependent stacks (currently spack-pe-gnu).\n\nspack-pe-base contains commonplace software compiled for CPU with the system\nGCC compilers. Accordingly, the software in spack-pe-base can be used\nregardless of programming environment.\n\nspack-pe-gnu is based on the E4S Project and\nprovides performant HPC libraries built with PrgEnv-gnu and the nvcc CUDA\ncompiler driver for GPU code. spack-pe-gnu is dependent on both\nspack-pe-base and PrgEnv-gnu.\n\nUsing software from the Spack PE\n\nThe base suite of software tools and libraries can be accessed by loading the\nspack-pe-base module. This adds a path to $MODULEPATH which contains\nnumerous modules.\n\nFor example, to load cmake starting from the default environment, a user\nshould run the following commands:\nmodule use /soft/modulefiles\nmodule load spack-pe-base\nmodule load cmake\n\nThe spack-pe-base module adds paths to the user's MODULEPATH; individual packages are subsequently loaded through the newly available modules. The full list of available packages can be viewed by running module avail or module --show-hidden avail for a complete listing. Packages are loaded in the same way from spack-pe-gnu.\n\nInspecting packages\n\nWhen a module in the Spack PE is loaded, several environment variables are\nupdated to integrate the package into the user's environment. Additionally, the\nPACKAGE_ROOT variable is set to the path to the installation prefix of the\npackage. For example, after loading cmake as above:\n\n$ echo $CMAKE_ROOT\n/soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/install/linux-sles15-x86_64/gcc-12.3.0/cmake-3.27.7-a435jtzvweeos2es6enirbxdjdqhqgdp/\n$ ls -a $CMAKE_ROOT\n.  ..  bin  doc  share  .spack",

Its main applications are electronic structure calculations of molecular, quasi-2D and solid-state systems. Variational Monte Carlo (VMC), diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) and a number of other advanced QMC algorithms are implemented. Orbital space auxiliary field QMC (AFQMC) has recently been added. By directly solving the Schrodinger equation, QMC methods offer greater accuracy than methods such as density functional theory, but at a trade-off of much greater computational expense.\n\nPrebuilt executables are provided at /soft/applications/qmcpack.\nThe directory of each installation also includes a job submission script example qmcpack-polaris.job.\nUpdate build recipe is provided on GitHub.",

For performance, it will likely be necessary to ensure that each application runs on a distinct set of CPU resources and/or targets specific GPUs. One can provide a list of CPUs using the --cpu-bind option, which when combined with CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES provides a user with specifying exactly which CPU and GPU resources to run each application on. In the example below, four instances of the application are simultaneously running on a single node. In the first instance, the application is spawning MPI ranks 0-7 on CPUs 24-31 and using GPU 0. This mapping is based on output from the nvidia-smi topo -m command and pairs CPUs with the closest GPU.\n\n```bash\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:24:25:26:27:28:29:30:31 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:16:17:18:19:20:21:22:23 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:8:9:10:11:12:13:14:15 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=3\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:0:1:2:3:4:5:6:7 ./hello_affinity &\n\nwait\n```\n\nCompute Node Access to the Internet\n\nCurrently, the only access the internet is via a proxy.

                "Use TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.  Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.  When possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention.\n\nUse XLA compilation on your code.  XLA is the Accelerated Linear Algebra library that is available in tensorFlow and critical in software like JAX.  XLA will compile a tf.Graph object, generated with tf.function or similar, and perform optimizations like operation-fusion.  XLA can give impressive performance boosts with almost no user changes except to set an environment variable TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2.  If your code is complex, or has dynamically sized tensors (tensors where the shape changes every iteration), XLA can be detrimental: the overhead for compiling functions can be large enough to mitigate performance improvements.  XLA is particularly powerful when combined with reduced precision, yielding speedups > 100% in some models.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nTensorFlow is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with tensorFlow has been seen with horovod in particular.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation.

Several simple examples for testing the software environment on Polaris for different programming models are available in the ALCF GettingStart repo.\n\nNote, users are encouraged to use PrgEnv-nvhpc instead of PrgEnv-nvidia as the latter will soon be deprecated in Cray's PE.

It is written in an exceptionally clean style that makes it one of the more popular codes for users to extend and it currently has dozens of user-developed extensions.\n\nFor details about the code and its usage, see the LAMMPS home page. This page provides information specific to running on Polaris at the ALCF.\n\nUsing LAMMPS at ALCF\n\nALCF provides assistance with build instructions, compiling executables, submitting jobs, and providing prebuilt binaries (upon request). A collection of Makefiles and submission scripts are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo here. For questions, contact us at support@alcf.anl.gov.\n\nHow to Obtain the Code\n\nLAMMPS is an open-source code, which can be downloaded from the LAMMPS website.\n\nBuilding on Polaris\n\nAfter LAMMPS has been downloaded and unpacked on an ALCF filesystem, users should see a directory whose name is of the form lammps-<version>. One should then see the Makefile lammps-<version>/src/MAKE/MACHINES/Makefile.polaris in recent versions that can be used as a starting point for compilation on Polaris. Copies of Makefiles for building with the GPU/KOKKOS package using CUDA for GPU support with the GNU/NVHPC compiler are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo here. For older versions of LAMMPS, you may need to take an existing Makefile (e.g. Makefile.mpi) for your specific version of LAMMPS and edit the top portion appropratiately to create a new Makefile.polaris.\n\nKOKKOS package and GNU compilers\n\nThe following modules are useful for this particular build. Note, the cmake module is not required if using the GNU Makefile procedure to build LAMMPS. The initial module restore is just setting the default environment as the starting point. Users may find it useful to copy these module commands into a small helper script to assist with compiling and running LAMMPS (e.g. setup_lammps_gnu.sh).",

If your build system does require GPUs, you cannot yet compile on the Polaris login nodes, as they do not currently have GPUs installed. You may in this case compile your applications on the Polaris compute nodes. Do this by submitting an interactive single-node job, or running your build system in a batch job.\n\nHome File System\n\nIs it helpful to realize that there is a single HOME filesystem for users that can be accessed from the login and computes of each production resource at ALCF. Thus, users should be mindful of modifications to their environments (e.g. .bashrc) that may cause issues to arise due to differences between the systems.\n\nCray Programming Environment\n\nThe Cray Programming Environment (PE) uses three compiler wrappers for building software.

                "Use TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.  Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.  When possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention.\n\nUse XLA compilation on your code.  XLA is the Accelerated Linear Algebra library that is available in tensorFlow and critical in software like JAX.  XLA will compile a tf.Graph object, generated with tf.function or similar, and perform optimizations like operation-fusion.  XLA can give impressive performance boosts with almost no user changes except to set an environment variable TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2.  If your code is complex, or has dynamically sized tensors (tensors where the shape changes every iteration), XLA can be detrimental: the overhead for compiling functions can be large enough to mitigate performance improvements.  XLA is particularly powerful when combined with reduced precision, yielding speedups > 100% in some models.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nTensorFlow is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with tensorFlow has been seen with horovod in particular.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation.  Some polaris specific details that may be helpful to you:\n\nCPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.  In particular, we encourage users to try their scaling measurements with the following settings:\n\nSet the environment variable NCCL_COLLNET_ENABLE=1",

It highlights that the `-cuda` flag has different effects on the output file when used with these three compilers.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the specific effect of the `-cuda` flag**\nAccording to the context, when using `nvc`, `nvc++`, or `nvfortran`, the `-cuda` flag enables CUDA C/C++ or CUDA Fortran code generation. This is in contrast to nvcc, where the same flag instructs it to compile `.cu` input files to `.cu.cpp.ii` output files.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the resulting output file**\nThe context states that the resulting output file for `nvc`, `nvc++`, or `nvfortran` with the `-cuda` flag is different from the one produced by nvcc. Specifically, the output file will be an object file (not text).\n\n**Step 4: Provide the final answer**\nBased on my reasoning above, I conclude that:\n\n<ANSWER>: The -cuda flag affects the output file when used with nvc, nvc++, or nvfortran by enabling CUDA C/C++ or CUDA Fortran code generation and producing an object file as the output."

If your build system does require GPUs, you cannot yet compile on the Polaris login nodes, as they do not currently have GPUs installed. You may in this case compile your applications on the Polaris compute nodes. Do this by submitting an interactive single-node job, or running your build system in a batch job.\n\nHome File System\n\nIs it helpful to realize that there is a single HOME filesystem for users that can be accessed from the login and computes of each production resource at ALCF. Thus, users should be mindful of modifications to their environments (e.g. .bashrc) that may cause issues to arise due to differences between the systems.\n\nCray Programming Environment\n\nThe Cray Programming Environment (PE) uses three compiler wrappers for building software. These compiler wrappers should be used when building MPI-enabled applications.\n\ncc - C compiler\n\nCC - C++ compiler\n\nftn - Fortran compiler\n\nEach of these wrappers can select a specific vendor compiler based on the PrgEnv module loaded in the environment. The following are some helpful options to understand what the compiler wrapper is invoking.\n\n--craype-verbose : Print the command which is forwarded to the compiler invocation\n\n--cray-print-opts=libs : Print library information\n\n--cray-print-opts=cflags : Print include information\n\nThe output from these commands may be useful in build scripts where a compiler other than that invoked by a compiler wrapper is desired. Defining some variables as such may prove useful in those situations.\nCRAY_CFLAGS=$(cc --cray-print-opts=cflags)\nCRAY_LIB=$(cc --cray-print-opts=libs)\nFurther documentation and options are available via man cc and similar.\n\nCompilers provided by Cray Programming Environments",

To use it from a compute node, please do:\n\nbash\nmodule load conda\nconda activate\n\nThen, you can load PyTorch in python as usual (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):\n\n```python\n\nimport torch\ntorch.version\n'1.12.0a0+git67ece03'\n\n```\n\nThis installation of PyTorch was built from source and the cuda libraries it uses are found via the CUDA_HOME environment variable (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):\n\nbash\n$ echo $CUDA_HOME\n/soft/datascience/cuda/cuda_11.5.2_495.29.05_linux\n\nIf you need to build applications that use this version of PyTorch and CUDA, we recommend using these cuda libraries to ensure compatibility.  We periodically update the PyTorch release, though updates will come in the form of new versions of the conda module.\n\nPyTorch is also available through nvidia containers that have been translated to Singularity containers.  For more information about containers, please see the containers documentation page.\n\nPyTorch Best Practices on Polaris\n\nSingle Node Performance\n\nWhen running PyTorch applications, we have found the following practices to be generally, if not universally, useful and encourage you to try some of these techniques to boost performance of your own applications.",

However, some of the RBCs are marked by the simulation that generated them as healthy (rbc.000) and some of them are marked as diseased (bad_rbc.000).\n\nUnhide the rbc.000 and bad_rbc.000 data sets by clicking the Eye icon next to each of them to make them visible\n\n13. Using Color to Differentiate Data\n\nTo enable us to distinguish these two types of data from one other, we can vary their representations.\n\nOne way to do this is by setting the color of the two data sets to different colors. Repeat this process for each of rbc.000 and bad_rbc.000, picking different colors.\n\nSelect one of the rbc data sets in the Pipeline Browser\n\nGo to the Displaytab in the Object Inspector\n\nIn the Color by:dropdown select Solid Color\n\nClick on the Set Solid Color... button\n\nSelect a color from the Select Colordialog that appears",

For this reason, it is recommended to use start_method=\"spawn\" on Polaris when using the MpiExecLauncher as is shown in the example config above.  Alternatively, another solution is to use the GNUParallelLauncher which uses GNU Parallel to spawn processes.  GNU Parallel can be loaded in your environment with the command module load gnu-parallel.  Both of these approaches will circumvent the hang issue from using fork.\n\nUpdates\n\nFor parsl versions after July 2023, the address passed in the HighThroughputExecutor needs to be set to address = address_by_interface(\"bond0\").  With parsl versions prior to July 2023, it was recommended to use address = address_by_hostname() on Polaris, but with later versions this will not work on Polaris (or any other machine).",

This guide details the use of containers on Polaris, including custom container creation, large-scale execution, and common pitfalls.\n\nApptainer Setup\n\nPolaris employs Apptainer (formerly known as Singularity) for container management. To set up Apptainer, run:\n\nbash\nmodule use /soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/install/modulefiles/Core\nmodule load apptainer\napptainer version #1.2.2\n\nThe Apptainer version on Polaris is 1.2.2. Detailed user documentation is available here\n\nBuilding from Docker or Argonne GitHub Container Registry\n\nContainers on Polaris can be built by writing Dockerfiles on a local machine and then publish the container to DockerHub, or by directly building them on ALCF compute node by writing an Apptainer recipe file. If you prefer to use existing containers, you can pull them from various registries like DockerHub and run them on Polaris.\n\nSince Docker requires root privileges, which users do not have on Polaris, existing Docker containers must be converted to Apptainer.

Existing binaries are unlikely to run successfully.\n\nWe have held all jobs submitted prior to the upgrade as a user hold. Users may release their existing jobs with qrls to run after they have rebuilt their binaries.\n\nPBS does cache the job execution script.  If a change to the script is required due to a path changing post rebuild, the job will have to be resubmitted.\n\nAll application binaries should be rebuilt prior to further job submissions.\n\nRe-building user codes\n\nMany user codes will need to be re-built and/or re-linked against the newer version of the programming environment (23.12) and Spack provided dependencies.\n\nChanges to the user software environment\n\nIn addition to the system upgrades, several changes have been made to the user\nsoftware environment which may impact user workflows.\n\nOlder PE versions removed\n\nOlder versions of the Cray PE (older than 23.12) are deprecated as they are incompatible with the\nupgraded system stack and are no longer available for use.\n\nDatascience Anaconda Module Updates",

                "TensorFlow on Polaris\n\nTensorFlow is a popular, open-source deep learning framework developed and released by Google.  The TensorFlow home page has more information about TensorFlow, which you can refer to.  For trouble shooting on Polaris, please contact support@alcf.anl.gov.\n\nInstallation on Polaris\n\nTensorFlow is already pre-installed on Polaris, available in the conda module.  To use it from a compute node, please do:\n\nbash\nmodule load conda\nconda activate\n\nThen, you can load TensorFlow in python as usual (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):\n\n```python\n\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.version\n'2.9.1'\n\n```\n\nThis installation of TensorFlow was built from source and the CUDA libraries it uses are found via the CUDA_HOME environment variable (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):\n\nbash\n$ echo $CUDA_HOME\n/soft/datascience/cuda/cuda_11.5.2_495.29.05_linux\n\nIf you need to build applications that use this version of TensorFlow and CUDA, we recommend using these cuda libraries to ensure compatibility.  We periodically update the TensorFlow release, though updates will come in the form of new versions of the conda module.\n\nTensorFlow is also available through NVIDIA containers that have been translated to Singularity containers.  For more information about containers, please see the Containers documentation page.\n\nTensorFlow Best Practices on Polaris\n\nSingle Node Performance\n\nWhen running TensorFlow applications, we have found the following practices to be generally, if not universally, useful and encourage you to try some of these techniques to boost performance of your own applications.\n\nUse Reduced Precision. Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with TensorFlow operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the tf.keras.mixed_precision Policy, as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  If you use a custom training loop (and not keras.Model.fit), you will also need to apply loss scaling.",

Therefore, this Julia depot folder should be located on a\nfast filesystem of your choice (grand, eagle). The Julia depot directory is\nset via the environment variable JULIA_DEPOT_PATH.

For on-node debugging purposes the default artifact is sufficient. However, for large-scale computations, it is important to use the Cray MPICH installed on Polaris.

In this case, it will be important to have the craype-accel-nvidia80 module loaded both when compiling your application and during runtime to correctly link against a GPU Transport Layer (GTL) MPI library. Otherwise, you'll likely see GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED is requested, but GTL library is not linked errors during runtime.\n- If running on a specific GPU or subset of GPUs is desired, then the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable can be used. For example, if one only wanted an application to access the first two GPUs on a node, then setting CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 could be used.\n\nBinding MPI ranks to GPUs\n\nThe Cray MPI on Polaris does not currently support binding MPI ranks to GPUs. For applications that need this support, this instead can be handled by use of a small helper script that will appropriately set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES for each MPI rank.

It is written in an exceptionally clean style that makes it one of the more popular codes for users to extend and it currently has dozens of user-developed extensions.\n\nFor details about the code and its usage, see the LAMMPS home page. This page provides information specific to running on Polaris at the ALCF.\n\nUsing LAMMPS at ALCF\n\nALCF provides assistance with build instructions, compiling executables, submitting jobs, and providing prebuilt binaries (upon request). A collection of Makefiles and submission scripts are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo here. For questions, contact us at support@alcf.anl.gov.\n\nHow to Obtain the Code\n\nLAMMPS is an open-source code, which can be downloaded from the LAMMPS website.\n\nBuilding on Polaris\n\nAfter LAMMPS has been downloaded and unpacked on an ALCF filesystem, users should see a directory whose name is of the form lammps-<version>. One should then see the Makefile lammps-<version>/src/MAKE/MACHINES/Makefile.polaris in recent versions that can be used as a starting point for compilation on Polaris. Copies of Makefiles for building with the GPU/KOKKOS package using CUDA for GPU support with the GNU/NVHPC compiler are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo here. For older versions of LAMMPS, you may need to take an existing Makefile (e.g. Makefile.mpi) for your specific version of LAMMPS and edit the top portion appropratiately to create a new Makefile.polaris.\n\nKOKKOS package and GNU compilers\n\nThe following modules are useful for this particular build. Note, the cmake module is not required if using the GNU Makefile procedure to build LAMMPS. The initial module restore is just setting the default environment as the starting point. Users may find it useful to copy these module commands into a small helper script to assist with compiling and running LAMMPS (e.g. setup_lammps_gnu.sh).",

In this case, it will be important to have the craype-accel-nvidia80 module loaded both when compiling your application and during runtime to correctly link against a GPU Transport Layer (GTL) MPI library. Otherwise, you'll likely see GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED is requested, but GTL library is not linked errors during runtime.\n- If running on a specific GPU or subset of GPUs is desired, then the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable can be used. For example, if one only wanted an application to access the first two GPUs on a node, then setting CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 could be used.\n\nBinding MPI ranks to GPUs\n\nThe Cray MPI on Polaris does not currently support binding MPI ranks to GPUs. For applications that need this support, this instead can be handled by use of a small helper script that will appropriately set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES for each MPI rank. One example is available here where each MPI rank is similarly bound to a single GPU with round-robin assignment.\n\nA example set_affinity_gpu_polaris.sh script follows where GPUs are assigned round-robin to MPI ranks.\n\n```bash\n\n!/bin/bash -l\n\nnum_gpus=4\n\nneed to assign GPUs in reverse order due to topology\n\nSee Polaris Device Affinity Information:\n\nhttps://www.alcf.anl.gov/support/user-guides/polaris/hardware-overview/machine-overview/index.html",

This mapping is based on output from the nvidia-smi topo -m command and pairs CPUs with the closest GPU.\n\n```bash\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:24:25:26:27:28:29:30:31 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:16:17:18:19:20:21:22:23 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:8:9:10:11:12:13:14:15 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=3\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:0:1:2:3:4:5:6:7 ./hello_affinity &\n\nwait\n```\n\nCompute Node Access to the Internet\n\nCurrently, the only access the internet is via a proxy.  Here are the proxy environment variables for Polaris:\n\nbash\nexport http_proxy=\"http://proxy.alcf.anl.gov:3128\"\nexport https_proxy=\"http://proxy.alcf.anl.gov:3128\"\nexport ftp_proxy=\"http://proxy.alcf.anl.gov:3128\"\n\nIn the future, though we don't have a timeline on this because it depends on future features in slingshot and internal software development, we intend to have public IP addresses be a schedulable resource.  For instance, if only your head node needed public access your select statement might looks something like: -l select=1:pubnet=True+63.\n\nControlling Where Your Job Runs",

Many tools exist to address this, of which parsl is just one.  On this page, we'll highlight some of the key pieces of information about parsl that are relevant to Polaris.  Parsl is also extensively documented, has a dedicated Slack Channel, and a large community of users and developers beyond ALCF.  We encourage you to engage with the parsl community for support with parsl specific questions, and for Polaris-specific questions or problems, please contact support@alcf.anl.gov.\n\nGetting Parsl on Polaris\n\nYou can install parsl building off of the conda modules.  You have some flexibility in how you want to extend the conda module to include parsl, but here is an example way to do it:\n\n```python\n\nLoad the Conda Module (needed everytime you use parsl)\n\nmodule load conda\nconda activate\n\nCreate a virtual env that uses the conda env as the system packages.\n\nOnly do the next line on initial set up:\n\npython -m venv --system-site-packages /path/to/your/virtualenv\n\nLoad the virtual env (every time):\n\nsource /path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/activate\n\nInstall parsl (only once)\n\npip install parsl\n\n```\n\nUsing Parsl on Polaris\n\nParsl has a variety of possible configuration settings.  As an example, we provide the configuration below that will run one task per GPU:\n\n```python\nfrom parsl.config import Config\n\nPBSPro is the right provider for Polaris:\n\nfrom parsl.providers import PBSProProvider\n\nThe high throughput executor is for scaling to HPC systems:\n\nfrom parsl.executors import HighThroughputExecutor\n\nYou can use the MPI launcher, but may want the Gnu Parallel launcher, see below\n\nfrom parsl.launchers import MpiExecLauncher, GnuParallelLauncher\n\naddress_by_interface is needed for the HighThroughputExecutor:",
        "question": "How can I use the Gnu Parallel launcher with Parsl on Polaris?",
        "cot_answer": "To use the Gnu Parallel launcher with Parsl on Polaris, follow these steps:\n\n1. Load the Conda module and activate it: `module load conda` followed by `conda activate`.\n2. Create a virtual environment that uses the Conda env as the system packages: `python -m venv --system-site-packages /path/to/your/virtualenv`. Only do this once during initial setup.\n3. Load the virtual environment every time you use Parsl: `source /path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/activate`.\n4. Install Parsl using pip: `pip install parsl`.\n\nTo configure Parsl to use the Gnu Parallel launcher, follow these steps:\n\n1. Import the necessary modules from Parsl:\n```\nfrom parsl.config import Config\nfrom parsl.providers import PBSProProvider\nfrom parsl.executors import HighThroughputExecutor\nfrom parsl.launchers import GnuParallelLauncher\n```\n2. Set up the configuration for Parsl:\n```\nconfig = Config()\nprovider = PBSProProvider()\nexec_config = {'max_workers': 1000}  # adjust this to your needs\nhtex = HighThroughputExecutor(default_provider=provider, exec_config=exec_config)\n```\n3. Use the Gnu Parallel launcher with Parsl:\n```\nfrom parsl.launchers import GnuParallelLauncher\n\n# Create a task that uses the Gnu Parallel launcher\ntask = htex.launcher(GnuParallelLauncher(), cmd='your_command')\n\n# Run the task\nresult = task.result()\n```\n\nFinal answer: <ANSWER>: Use the Gnu Parallel launcher with Parsl on Polaris by following steps 1-4 to set up Parsl, and then configure Parsl using the necessary modules and configuration settings."

If build your application is problematic for some reason (e.g. absence of a GPU), then users are encouraged to build and test applications directly on one of the Polaris compute nodes via an interactive job. The discussion below makes use of the NVHPC compilers in the default environment as illustrative examples. Similar examples for other compilers on Polaris are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo.\n\nCPU MPI+OpenMP Example\n\nOne of the first useful tasks with any new machine, scheduler, and job launcher is to ensure one is binding MPI ranks and OpenMP threads to the host cpu as intended.

The environment variable NVIDIA_PATH is defined for the PrgEnv-nvhpc programming environment. \nCC -o vecadd -g -O3 -std=c++0x  -I${NVIDIA_PATH}/cuda/include main.o -L${NVIDIA_PATH}/cuda/lib64 -lOpenCL\n\nThis simple example can be run on a Polaris compute node as follows.\n```\n$ ./vecadd\nRunning on GPU!\nUsing single-precision\n\nResult is CORRECT!! :)\n```\n\nGPU OpenMP\n\nA simple MPI-parallel OpenMP example is available here. Compilation proceeds similar to the above examples except for use of the -mp=gpu compiler flag to indicated compilation of OpenMP code for GPUs.\n\nCC -g -O3 -std=c++0x -mp=gpu -gpu=cc80,cuda11.0 -c main.cpp -o vecadd\n\nSimilar to the OpenACC example above, this code binds MPI ranks to GPUs in a round-robin fashion. \n```\n$ mpiexec -n 4 ./vecadd\n\nof devices= 4\n\nRank 0 running on GPU 0!\nRank 1 running on GPU 1!\nRank 2 running on GPU 2!\nRank 3 running on GPU 3!\n\nResult is CORRECT!! :)\n```",

The version you download must match the server version installed on Polaris. Use this page\n\nDownload the Polaris host profile for VisIt (you may need to right-click and choose \"Save link as...\" or \"Save target as...\")\n\nCopy this file to a file called ~/.visit/hosts/host_anl_polaris.xml on Mac or Linux. [ We need to also specify this path for for Windows]\n\nNote: VisIt allows the user to download host profiles for ANL, but all these settings are outdated. We are working with the VisIt developers to update the ANL host list.\n\nAdditional information for using VisIt in client/server mode here\n\nRunning VisIt\n\nStart up VisIt on your local machine\n\nClick File -> Open File and choose \"ANL Polaris\" from the \"Host\" dropdown\n\nYou'll be prompted for your password; enter your ALCF authenticator app response\n\nWhen you open a selected file, it will launch a job on Polaris\nYou will need to specify the \"Bank\" (Project) to use when VisIt submits jobs to the queue on Polaris. Specify a project in the Options box.\nIf your environment doesn't get sourced correctly with non-interactive SSH, you can set the default project to use under Options -> Host profiles\n\nAdditional Information\n\nAdditional Information\n\nVisIt user manual\n\nVisIt wiki",

The `nodes_per_block` parameter is part of the `PBSProProvider` configuration in the given context.\n2. According to the documentation for the `PBSProProvider`, this parameter controls the number of compute nodes allocated for each block.\n3. In PBS Pro, a block refers to a group of tasks that are executed together as a single unit.\n4. When `nodes_per_block` is set to a specific value, it determines how many nodes will be allocated for each block in the job.\n5. This means that if you have multiple blocks in your job (e.g., due to parallelism or array jobs), PBS Pro will allocate the specified number of nodes for each block.\n\n##begin_quote##\n                    nodes_per_block=user_opts[\"nodes_per_block\"],\n##end_quote##\n\n6. Therefore, the `nodes_per_block` parameter affects job execution by controlling the number of nodes allocated for each block in the job, which can impact factors such as job performance, memory usage, and resource utilization.\n\nFinal Answer:\n<ANSWER>: The `nodes_per_block` parameter controls the number of compute nodes allocated for each block in PBS Pro, affecting job execution by impacting factors such as job performance, memory usage, and resource utilization."

        "question": "Can you explain the role of the `PBSProProvider` in the high-throughput computing setup?",
        "cot_answer": "To answer this question, I will provide step-by-step reasoning on how to explain the role of `PBSProProvider` in the high-throughput computing setup.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the context**\nThe context is a configuration for a high-throughput computing setup using PBS Pro as the job scheduler. The configuration includes various settings and options for the PBS Pro provider, which is represented by the `PBSProProvider` class.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the role of `PBSProProvider`**\nThe `PBSProProvider` class is responsible for managing the interaction between the high-throughput computing setup and the PBS Pro job scheduler. Its primary role is to launch jobs on a cluster using PBS Pro, which allows for efficient management of compute resources.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the configuration options**\nThe configuration options provided in the context give us insight into how `PBSProProvider` works. For example, the `launcher` option specifies the command-line tool used to launch jobs (in this case, MPIExecLauncher). The `account`, `queue`, and `select_options` options specify the PBS Pro job submission settings.\n\n**Step 4: Summarize the role of `PBSProProvider`**\nBased on the analysis above, we can conclude that the `PBSProProvider` plays a crucial role in managing the interaction between the high-throughput computing setup and the PBS Pro job scheduler. It launches jobs on a cluster using PBS Pro, allowing for efficient management of compute resources.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n<ANSWER>: The `PBSProProvider` is responsible for launching jobs on a cluster using PBS Pro, allowing for efficient management of compute resources in high-throughput computing setups."

For this reason, it is recommended to use start_method=\"spawn\" on Polaris when using the MpiExecLauncher as is shown in the example config above.  Alternatively, another solution is to use the GNUParallelLauncher which uses GNU Parallel to spawn processes.  GNU Parallel can be loaded in your environment with the command module load gnu-parallel.  Both of these approaches will circumvent the hang issue from using fork.\n\nUpdates\n\nFor parsl versions after July 2023, the address passed in the HighThroughputExecutor needs to be set to address = address_by_interface(\"bond0\").  With parsl versions prior to July 2023, it was recommended to use address = address_by_hostname() on Polaris, but with later versions this will not work on Polaris (or any other machine).",

                "Parsl on Polaris\n\nParsl is a flexible and scalable parallel programming library for Python.\n\n-- Parsl Documentation\n\nFor many applications, managing an ensemble of jobs into a workflow is a critical step that can easily become a performance bottleneck.  Many tools exist to address this, of which parsl is just one.  On this page, we'll highlight some of the key pieces of information about parsl that are relevant to Polaris.  Parsl is also extensively documented, has a dedicated Slack Channel, and a large community of users and developers beyond ALCF.  We encourage you to engage with the parsl community for support with parsl specific questions, and for Polaris-specific questions or problems, please contact support@alcf.anl.gov.\n\nGetting Parsl on Polaris\n\nYou can install parsl building off of the conda modules.  You have some flexibility in how you want to extend the conda module to include parsl, but here is an example way to do it:\n\n```python\n\nLoad the Conda Module (needed everytime you use parsl)\n\nmodule load conda\nconda activate\n\nCreate a virtual env that uses the conda env as the system packages.\n\nOnly do the next line on initial set up:\n\npython -m venv --system-site-packages /path/to/your/virtualenv\n\nLoad the virtual env (every time):\n\nsource /path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/activate\n\nInstall parsl (only once)\n\npip install parsl\n\n```\n\nUsing Parsl on Polaris\n\nParsl has a variety of possible configuration settings.  As an example, we provide the configuration below that will run one task per GPU:\n\n```python\nfrom parsl.config import Config\n\nPBSPro is the right provider for Polaris:\n\nfrom parsl.providers import PBSProProvider\n\nThe high throughput executor is for scaling to HPC systems:\n\nfrom parsl.executors import HighThroughputExecutor\n\nYou can use the MPI launcher, but may want the Gnu Parallel launcher, see below\n\nfrom parsl.launchers import MpiExecLauncher, GnuParallelLauncher\n\naddress_by_interface is needed for the HighThroughputExecutor:",

Users are encouraged to email support@alcf.anl.gov to report issues.\n\nSubmitting Jobs\n\nFor batch job submissions, if the parameters within your submission script do not meet the parameters of any of the execution queues (small, ..., backfill-large) you might not receive the \"Job submission\" error on the command line at all, and the job will never appear in history qstat -xu <username> (current bug in PBS). E.g. if a user submits a script to the prod routing queue requesting 10 nodes for 24 hours, exceeding \"Time Max\" of 6 hrs of the small execution queue (which handles jobs with 10-24 nodes), then it may behave as if the job was never submitted.\n\nJob scripts are copied to temporary locations after qsub and any changes to the original script while the job is queued will not be reflected in the copied script. Furthermore, qalter requires -A <allocation name> when changing job properties. Currently, there is a request for a qalter-like command to trigger a re-copy of the original script to the temporary location.\n\nCompiling & Running Applications\n\nIf your job fails to start with an RPC launch message like below, please forward the complete messages to support@alcf.anl.gov.\n\nbash\n   launch failed on x3104c0s1b0n0: Couldn't forward RPC launch(ab751d77-e80a-4c54-b1c2-4e881f7e8c90) to child x3104c0s31b0n0.hsn.cm.polaris.alcf.anl.gov: Resource temporarily unavailable",

                "Running Multiple MPI Applications on a node\n\nMultiple applications can be run simultaneously on a node by launching several mpiexec commands and backgrounding them. For performance, it will likely be necessary to ensure that each application runs on a distinct set of CPU resources and/or targets specific GPUs. One can provide a list of CPUs using the --cpu-bind option, which when combined with CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES provides a user with specifying exactly which CPU and GPU resources to run each application on. In the example below, four instances of the application are simultaneously running on a single node. In the first instance, the application is spawning MPI ranks 0-7 on CPUs 24-31 and using GPU 0. This mapping is based on output from the nvidia-smi topo -m command and pairs CPUs with the closest GPU.\n\n```bash\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:24:25:26:27:28:29:30:31 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:16:17:18:19:20:21:22:23 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:8:9:10:11:12:13:14:15 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=3\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:0:1:2:3:4:5:6:7 ./hello_affinity &\n\nwait\n```\n\nCompute Node Access to the Internet\n\nCurrently, the only access the internet is via a proxy.  Here are the proxy environment variables for Polaris:\n\nbash\nexport http_proxy=\"http://proxy.alcf.anl.gov:3128\"\nexport https_proxy=\"http://proxy.alcf.anl.gov:3128\"\nexport ftp_proxy=\"http://proxy.alcf.anl.gov:3128\"\n\nIn the future, though we don't have a timeline on this because it depends on future features in slingshot and internal software development, we intend to have public IP addresses be a schedulable resource.  For instance, if only your head node needed public access your select statement might looks something like: -l select=1:pubnet=True+63.\n\nControlling Where Your Job Runs",

For this reason, it is recommended to use start_method=\"spawn\" on Polaris when using the MpiExecLauncher as is shown in the example config above.  Alternatively, another solution is to use the GNUParallelLauncher which uses GNU Parallel to spawn processes.  GNU Parallel can be loaded in your environment with the command module load gnu-parallel.  Both of these approaches will circumvent the hang issue from using fork.\n\nUpdates\n\nFor parsl versions after July 2023, the address passed in the HighThroughputExecutor needs to be set to address = address_by_interface(\"bond0\").

Analyze the output of `nvidia-smi` to determine the purpose of MIG in NVIDIA's CUDA architecture.\n\nFrom the output, it is clear that each instance of saxpy is running on its own GPU, which is a characteristic of MIG. This suggests that the purpose of MIG is to provide multiple instances of GPUs with different memory configurations, allowing for more efficient use of resources and improved performance in certain applications.\n\n<ANSWER>: The purpose of MIG (Multi-Instance GPU) in NVIDIA's CUDA architecture is to provide multiple instances of GPUs with different memory configurations, allowing for more efficient use of resources and improved performance in certain applications."

The specification describes directives, runtime routines, and environment variables that allow an application developer to express parallelism (e.g. shared memory multiprocessing and device offloading). Many compiler vendors provide implementations of the OpenMP specification (https://www.openmp.org/specifications).\n\nSetting the environment to use OpenMP on Polaris\n\nMany of the programming environments available on Polaris have OpenMP support.\n\nmodule OpenMP CPU support? OpenMP GPU support? PrgEnv-nvhpc yes yes llvm yes yes PrgEnv-gnu yes no PrgEnv-cray yes yes*\n\nCurrently PrgEnv-cray is not recommended for OpenMP offload.\n\nBy default, the PrgEnv-nvhpc module is loaded. To switch to other modules, you can use module switch.\n\nUsing PrgEnv-nvhpc\n\nThis is loaded by default, so there's no need to load additional modules. You can confirm that it is loaded by running module list to check that PrgEnv-nvhpc is in the list.\n\nUsing LLVM\n\nTo use the LLVM module, load the following.\nmodule load mpiwrappers/cray-mpich-llvm\nmodule load cudatoolkit-standalone\n\nSee the the LLVM compiling page here for more information.\n\nUsing PrgEnv-gnu\n\nTo switch from PrgEnv-nvhpc to PrgEnv-gnu you can run:\n\nmodule switch PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-gnu\n\nThe gcc/gfortran on Polaris was not built with GPU support. To use OpenMP on the CPU, you need to unload craype-accel-nvidia80:\n\nmodule unload craype-accel-nvidia80\n\nUsing PrgEnv-cray\n\nTo switch from PrgEnv-nvhpc to PrgEnv-cray you can run:\n\nmodule switch PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-cray\n\nTo use OpenMP on the CPU only, also unload craype-accel-nvidia80:\n\nmodule unload craype-accel-nvidia80\n\nTo use OpenMP on the GPU, load cudatoolkit-standalone, although this is not recommended at the moment.\nmodule load cudatoolkit-standalone\n\nBuilding on Polaris",

If build your application is problematic for some reason (e.g. absence of a GPU), then users are encouraged to build and test applications directly on one of the Polaris compute nodes via an interactive job. The discussion below makes use of the NVHPC compilers in the default environment as illustrative examples. Similar examples for other compilers on Polaris are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo.\n\nCPU MPI+OpenMP Example\n\nOne of the first useful tasks with any new machine, scheduler, and job launcher is to ensure one is binding MPI ranks and OpenMP threads to the host cpu as intended. A simple HelloWorld MPI+OpenMP example is available here to get started with.\n\nThe application can be straightforwardly compiled using the Cray compiler wrappers.\nCC -fopenmp main.cpp -o hello_affinity\n\nThe executable hello_affinity can then be launched in a job script (or directly in shell of interactive job) using mpiexec as discussed here.\n\n```\n\n!/bin/sh\n\nPBS -l select=1:system=polaris\n\nPBS -l place=scatter\n\nPBS -l walltime=0:30:00\n\nPBS -l filesystems=home\n\nMPI example w/ 16 MPI ranks per node spread evenly across cores\n\nNNODES=wc -l < $PBS_NODEFILE\nNRANKS_PER_NODE=16\nNDEPTH=4\nNTHREADS=1\n\nNTOTRANKS=$(( NNODES * NRANKS_PER_NODE ))\necho \"NUM_OF_NODES= ${NNODES} TOTAL_NUM_RANKS= ${NTOTRANKS} RANKS_PER_NODE= ${NRANKS_PER_NODE} THREADS_PER_RANK= ${NTHREADS}\"\n\nmpiexec -n ${NTOTRANKS} --ppn ${NRANKS_PER_NODE} --depth=${NDEPTH} --cpu-bind depth ./hello_affinity\n```\n\nCUDA\n\nSeveral variants of C/C++ and Fortran CUDA examples are available here that include MPI and multi-gpu examples.\n\nOne can use the Cray compiler wrappers to compile GPU-enabled applications as well.

First, let's get a list of all MIG instances using the command `nvidia-smi -L | grep -Po -e \"MIG[0-9a-f-]+\"`. This will give us a list of MIG instance IDs.\n2. Next, we can iterate over this list and set the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable for each instance.\n\nHere's the code snippet:\n```bash\nfor mig in $( nvidia-smi -L | grep -Po -e \"MIG[0-9a-f-]+\" ) ; do CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=${mig} ./saxpy & done 2>/dev/null\n```\nThis will set the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable to each MIG instance ID and run the `./saxpy` command.\n\n3. Finally, we can verify that the correct MIG instances are being used by running the `nvidia-smi` command again:\n```bash\nnvidia-smi | tail -n 16\n```\nThis will show us the processes running on each GPU and which MIG instance is being used for each process.\n\nFinal answer: <ANSWER>: You can specify which MIG instance to use with the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable by iterating over the list of MIG instances and setting the environment variable for each instance."

Note that if you import mpi4py or horovod, and then do something like os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = hvd.local_rank(), it may not actually work!  You must set the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable prior to doing MPI.COMM_WORLD.init(), which is done in horovod.init() as well as implicitly in from mpi4py import MPI.   On Polaris specifically, you can use the environment variable PMI_LOCAL_RANK (as well as PMI_LOCAL_SIZE) to learn information about the node-local MPI ranks.\n\nDeepSpeed\n\nDeepSpeed is also available and usable on Polaris.

Its main applications are electronic structure calculations of molecular, quasi-2D and solid-state systems. Variational Monte Carlo (VMC), diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) and a number of other advanced QMC algorithms are implemented. Orbital space auxiliary field QMC (AFQMC) has recently been added. By directly solving the Schrodinger equation, QMC methods offer greater accuracy than methods such as density functional theory, but at a trade-off of much greater computational expense.\n\nPrebuilt executables are provided at /soft/applications/qmcpack.\nThe directory of each installation also includes a job submission script example qmcpack-polaris.job.\nUpdate build recipe is provided on GitHub.",

                "Use TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.  Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.  When possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention.\n\nUse XLA compilation on your code.  XLA is the Accelerated Linear Algebra library that is available in tensorFlow and critical in software like JAX.  XLA will compile a tf.Graph object, generated with tf.function or similar, and perform optimizations like operation-fusion.  XLA can give impressive performance boosts with almost no user changes except to set an environment variable TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2.  If your code is complex, or has dynamically sized tensors (tensors where the shape changes every iteration), XLA can be detrimental: the overhead for compiling functions can be large enough to mitigate performance improvements.  XLA is particularly powerful when combined with reduced precision, yielding speedups > 100% in some models.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nTensorFlow is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with tensorFlow has been seen with horovod in particular.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation.

Columns 2, 3, and 4 contain numerical values: `2`, `5`, `0`, `17486`, `17487`, `17488`, and `17489`.\n3. Column 1 contains integers: `2`, `3`, `3`, and `3`. These likely represent some kind of identifier or index.\n4. The fifth column appears to contain strings, possibly file paths or directory names: `.saxpy` (repeated multiple times).\n5. The sixth column contains a large number: `83,13MiB`. This is likely a measurement of disk space or memory usage.\n\nGiven these observations, each line of the output shows a unique combination of values for columns 2, 3, and 4, along with some additional information in columns 5 and 6."

                "Use TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.  Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.  When possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention.\n\nUse XLA compilation on your code.  XLA is the Accelerated Linear Algebra library that is available in tensorFlow and critical in software like JAX.  XLA will compile a tf.Graph object, generated with tf.function or similar, and perform optimizations like operation-fusion.  XLA can give impressive performance boosts with almost no user changes except to set an environment variable TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2.  If your code is complex, or has dynamically sized tensors (tensors where the shape changes every iteration), XLA can be detrimental: the overhead for compiling functions can be large enough to mitigate performance improvements.  XLA is particularly powerful when combined with reduced precision, yielding speedups > 100% in some models.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nTensorFlow is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with tensorFlow has been seen with horovod in particular.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation.  Some polaris specific details that may be helpful to you:\n\nCPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.  In particular, we encourage users to try their scaling measurements with the following settings:\n\nSet the environment variable NCCL_COLLNET_ENABLE=1",

                "OpenMP\n\nOverview\n\nThe OpenMP API is an open standard for parallel programming. The specification document can be found here: https://www.openmp.org. The specification describes directives, runtime routines, and environment variables that allow an application developer to express parallelism (e.g. shared memory multiprocessing and device offloading). Many compiler vendors provide implementations of the OpenMP specification (https://www.openmp.org/specifications).\n\nSetting the environment to use OpenMP on Polaris\n\nMany of the programming environments available on Polaris have OpenMP support.\n\nmodule OpenMP CPU support? OpenMP GPU support? PrgEnv-nvhpc yes yes llvm yes yes PrgEnv-gnu yes no PrgEnv-cray yes yes*\n\nCurrently PrgEnv-cray is not recommended for OpenMP offload.\n\nBy default, the PrgEnv-nvhpc module is loaded. To switch to other modules, you can use module switch.\n\nUsing PrgEnv-nvhpc\n\nThis is loaded by default, so there's no need to load additional modules. You can confirm that it is loaded by running module list to check that PrgEnv-nvhpc is in the list.\n\nUsing LLVM\n\nTo use the LLVM module, load the following.\nmodule load mpiwrappers/cray-mpich-llvm\nmodule load cudatoolkit-standalone\n\nSee the the LLVM compiling page here for more information.\n\nUsing PrgEnv-gnu\n\nTo switch from PrgEnv-nvhpc to PrgEnv-gnu you can run:\n\nmodule switch PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-gnu\n\nThe gcc/gfortran on Polaris was not built with GPU support. To use OpenMP on the CPU, you need to unload craype-accel-nvidia80:\n\nmodule unload craype-accel-nvidia80\n\nUsing PrgEnv-cray\n\nTo switch from PrgEnv-nvhpc to PrgEnv-cray you can run:\n\nmodule switch PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-cray\n\nTo use OpenMP on the CPU only, also unload craype-accel-nvidia80:\n\nmodule unload craype-accel-nvidia80\n\nTo use OpenMP on the GPU, load cudatoolkit-standalone, although this is not recommended at the moment.\nmodule load cudatoolkit-standalone\n\nBuilding on Polaris",

                "Spack PE\n\nSpack is an HPC-oriented package manager which ALCF uses to install software for\nthe user environment.\n\nALCF's Spack PE is a Spack-managed software stack which provides various build\ntools, utilities, and libraries. It consists of a base stack (spack-pe-base)\nand PrgEnv-dependent stacks (currently spack-pe-gnu).\n\nspack-pe-base contains commonplace software compiled for CPU with the system\nGCC compilers. Accordingly, the software in spack-pe-base can be used\nregardless of programming environment.\n\nspack-pe-gnu is based on the E4S Project and\nprovides performant HPC libraries built with PrgEnv-gnu and the nvcc CUDA\ncompiler driver for GPU code. spack-pe-gnu is dependent on both\nspack-pe-base and PrgEnv-gnu.\n\nUsing software from the Spack PE\n\nThe base suite of software tools and libraries can be accessed by loading the\nspack-pe-base module. This adds a path to $MODULEPATH which contains\nnumerous modules.\n\nFor example, to load cmake starting from the default environment, a user\nshould run the following commands:\nmodule use /soft/modulefiles\nmodule load spack-pe-base\nmodule load cmake\n\nThe spack-pe-base module adds paths to the user's MODULEPATH; individual packages are subsequently loaded through the newly available modules. The full list of available packages can be viewed by running module avail or module --show-hidden avail for a complete listing. Packages are loaded in the same way from spack-pe-gnu.\n\nInspecting packages\n\nWhen a module in the Spack PE is loaded, several environment variables are\nupdated to integrate the package into the user's environment. Additionally, the\nPACKAGE_ROOT variable is set to the path to the installation prefix of the\npackage. For example, after loading cmake as above:\n\n$ echo $CMAKE_ROOT\n/soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/install/linux-sles15-x86_64/gcc-12.3.0/cmake-3.27.7-a435jtzvweeos2es6enirbxdjdqhqgdp/\n$ ls -a $CMAKE_ROOT\n.  ..  bin  doc  share  .spack",

                "Mixed C/C++ & Fortran Applications\n\nFor applications consisting of a mix of C/C++ and Fortran that also uses MPI, it is suggested that the programming environment chosen for Fortran be used to build the full application because of mpi.mod (and similar) incompatibilities.\n\nCompiling for GPUs\n\nIt is assumed the majority of applications to be built on Polaris will make use of the GPUs. As such, the craype-accel-nvidia80 module is in the default environment. This has the effect of the Cray compiler wrappers adding -gpu to the compiler invocation along with additional include paths and libraries. Additional compilers flags may be needed depending on the compiler and GPU programming model used (e.g. -cuda, -acc, or -mp=gpu).\n\nThis module also adds GPU Transport Layer (GTL) libraries to the link-line to support GPU-aware MPI applications.\n\nMan Pages\n\nFor additional information on the Cray wrappers, please refer to the man pages.\nman cc\nman CC\nman ftn",

It is written in an exceptionally clean style that makes it one of the more popular codes for users to extend and it currently has dozens of user-developed extensions.\n\nFor details about the code and its usage, see the LAMMPS home page. This page provides information specific to running on Polaris at the ALCF.\n\nUsing LAMMPS at ALCF\n\nALCF provides assistance with build instructions, compiling executables, submitting jobs, and providing prebuilt binaries (upon request). A collection of Makefiles and submission scripts are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo here. For questions, contact us at support@alcf.anl.gov.\n\nHow to Obtain the Code\n\nLAMMPS is an open-source code, which can be downloaded from the LAMMPS website.\n\nBuilding on Polaris\n\nAfter LAMMPS has been downloaded and unpacked on an ALCF filesystem, users should see a directory whose name is of the form lammps-<version>. One should then see the Makefile lammps-<version>/src/MAKE/MACHINES/Makefile.polaris in recent versions that can be used as a starting point for compilation on Polaris. Copies of Makefiles for building with the GPU/KOKKOS package using CUDA for GPU support with the GNU/NVHPC compiler are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo here. For older versions of LAMMPS, you may need to take an existing Makefile (e.g. Makefile.mpi) for your specific version of LAMMPS and edit the top portion appropratiately to create a new Makefile.polaris.\n\nKOKKOS package and GNU compilers\n\nThe following modules are useful for this particular build. Note, the cmake module is not required if using the GNU Makefile procedure to build LAMMPS. The initial module restore is just setting the default environment as the starting point. Users may find it useful to copy these module commands into a small helper script to assist with compiling and running LAMMPS (e.g. setup_lammps_gnu.sh).",

This guide details the use of containers on Polaris, including custom container creation, large-scale execution, and common pitfalls.\n\nApptainer Setup\n\nPolaris employs Apptainer (formerly known as Singularity) for container management. To set up Apptainer, run:\n\nbash\nmodule use /soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/install/modulefiles/Core\nmodule load apptainer\napptainer version #1.2.2\n\nThe Apptainer version on Polaris is 1.2.2. Detailed user documentation is available here\n\nBuilding from Docker or Argonne GitHub Container Registry\n\nContainers on Polaris can be built by writing Dockerfiles on a local machine and then publish the container to DockerHub, or by directly building them on ALCF compute node by writing an Apptainer recipe file. If you prefer to use existing containers, you can pull them from various registries like DockerHub and run them on Polaris.\n\nSince Docker requires root privileges, which users do not have on Polaris, existing Docker containers must be converted to Apptainer. To build a Docker-based container on Polaris, use the following as an example:",

We need to find out which one controls the default CUDA runtime.\n\n2. Look for a command that sets the default CUDA runtime version.\n\nIn the context, I found the following command:\n```\n$ julia --project -e \"using CUDA; CUDA.set_runtime_version!(local_toolkit=true)\"\n```\nThis command uses the `CUDA` package and sets the default CUDA runtime version using the `set_runtime_version!` function. This suggests that the `CUDA` package is responsible for controlling the default CUDA runtime.\n\n3. Verify that the `CUDA` package controls the default CUDA runtime by checking its version information.\n\nFrom the context, we can see that the command:\n```\n$ julia --project -e \"using CUDA; CUDA.versioninfo()\"\n```\ndisplays the version information of the `CUDA` package, including the CUDA runtime version.

In this case, it will be important to have the craype-accel-nvidia80 module loaded both when compiling your application and during runtime to correctly link against a GPU Transport Layer (GTL) MPI library. Otherwise, you'll likely see GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED is requested, but GTL library is not linked errors during runtime.\n- If running on a specific GPU or subset of GPUs is desired, then the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable can be used. For example, if one only wanted an application to access the first two GPUs on a node, then setting CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 could be used.\n\nBinding MPI ranks to GPUs\n\nThe Cray MPI on Polaris does not currently support binding MPI ranks to GPUs. For applications that need this support, this instead can be handled by use of a small helper script that will appropriately set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES for each MPI rank. One example is available here where each MPI rank is similarly bound to a single GPU with round-robin assignment.\n\nA example set_affinity_gpu_polaris.sh script follows where GPUs are assigned round-robin to MPI ranks.\n\n```bash\n\n!/bin/bash -l\n\nnum_gpus=4\n\nneed to assign GPUs in reverse order due to topology\n\nSee Polaris Device Affinity Information:\n\nhttps://www.alcf.anl.gov/support/user-guides/polaris/hardware-overview/machine-overview/index.html",

For this reason, it is recommended to use start_method=\"spawn\" on Polaris when using the MpiExecLauncher as is shown in the example config above.  Alternatively, another solution is to use the GNUParallelLauncher which uses GNU Parallel to spawn processes.  GNU Parallel can be loaded in your environment with the command module load gnu-parallel.  Both of these approaches will circumvent the hang issue from using fork.\n\nUpdates\n\nFor parsl versions after July 2023, the address passed in the HighThroughputExecutor needs to be set to address = address_by_interface(\"bond0\").  With parsl versions prior to July 2023, it was recommended to use address = address_by_hostname() on Polaris, but with later versions this will not work on Polaris (or any other machine).",

This guide details the use of containers on Polaris, including custom container creation, large-scale execution, and common pitfalls.\n\nApptainer Setup\n\nPolaris employs Apptainer (formerly known as Singularity) for container management. To set up Apptainer, run:\n\nbash\nmodule use /soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/install/modulefiles/Core\nmodule load apptainer\napptainer version #1.2.2\n\nThe Apptainer version on Polaris is 1.2.2. Detailed user documentation is available here\n\nBuilding from Docker or Argonne GitHub Container Registry\n\nContainers on Polaris can be built by writing Dockerfiles on a local machine and then publish the container to DockerHub, or by directly building them on ALCF compute node by writing an Apptainer recipe file. If you prefer to use existing containers, you can pull them from various registries like DockerHub and run them on Polaris.\n\nSince Docker requires root privileges, which users do not have on Polaris, existing Docker containers must be converted to Apptainer. To build a Docker-based container on Polaris, use the following as an example:",

                "OpenMP\n\nOverview\n\nThe OpenMP API is an open standard for parallel programming. The specification document can be found here: https://www.openmp.org. The specification describes directives, runtime routines, and environment variables that allow an application developer to express parallelism (e.g. shared memory multiprocessing and device offloading). Many compiler vendors provide implementations of the OpenMP specification (https://www.openmp.org/specifications).\n\nSetting the environment to use OpenMP on Polaris\n\nMany of the programming environments available on Polaris have OpenMP support.\n\nmodule OpenMP CPU support? OpenMP GPU support? PrgEnv-nvhpc yes yes llvm yes yes PrgEnv-gnu yes no PrgEnv-cray yes yes*\n\nCurrently PrgEnv-cray is not recommended for OpenMP offload.\n\nBy default, the PrgEnv-nvhpc module is loaded. To switch to other modules, you can use module switch.\n\nUsing PrgEnv-nvhpc\n\nThis is loaded by default, so there's no need to load additional modules. You can confirm that it is loaded by running module list to check that PrgEnv-nvhpc is in the list.\n\nUsing LLVM\n\nTo use the LLVM module, load the following.\nmodule load mpiwrappers/cray-mpich-llvm\nmodule load cudatoolkit-standalone\n\nSee the the LLVM compiling page here for more information.\n\nUsing PrgEnv-gnu\n\nTo switch from PrgEnv-nvhpc to PrgEnv-gnu you can run:\n\nmodule switch PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-gnu\n\nThe gcc/gfortran on Polaris was not built with GPU support. To use OpenMP on the CPU, you need to unload craype-accel-nvidia80:\n\nmodule unload craype-accel-nvidia80\n\nUsing PrgEnv-cray\n\nTo switch from PrgEnv-nvhpc to PrgEnv-cray you can run:\n\nmodule switch PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-cray\n\nTo use OpenMP on the CPU only, also unload craype-accel-nvidia80:\n\nmodule unload craype-accel-nvidia80\n\nTo use OpenMP on the GPU, load cudatoolkit-standalone, although this is not recommended at the moment.\nmodule load cudatoolkit-standalone\n\nBuilding on Polaris",

        "cot_answer": "To answer this question, I will provide step-by-step reasoning on how to determine the purpose of the MPI kernel in this code snippet.\n\n1. First, let's identify what an MPI (Message Passing Interface) kernel is. An MPI kernel is a function that is executed by multiple processes or threads concurrently, and it is used for parallel computing.\n2. In the given code snippet, we can see that there are several functions defined: `pi_kernel`, `approximate_pi_gpu`, and `main`. The `pi_kernel` function appears to be an MPI kernel, as it takes in parameters such as `x`, `y`, `d`, and `n`, which suggests that it is designed for parallel computing.\n3. The purpose of the `pi_kernel` function can be determined by examining its code. The function seems to be calculating the value of pi using a Monte Carlo method, where random points are generated within a square and then checked to see if they fall within a circle inscribed in that square. If a point falls within the circle, it is counted as being inside the circle.\n4. The `pi_kernel` function appears to be designed for parallel computing because it uses CUDA (a parallel computing platform) and MPI (Message Passing Interface). This suggests that the function is intended to be executed by multiple processes or threads concurrently.\n\nBased on this analysis, I conclude that the purpose of the MPI kernel in this code snippet is to calculate the value of pi using a Monte Carlo method in parallel."

To use it from a compute node, please do:\n\nbash\nmodule load conda\nconda activate\n\nThen, you can load TensorFlow in python as usual (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):\n\n```python\n\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.version\n'2.9.1'\n\n```\n\nThis installation of TensorFlow was built from source and the CUDA libraries it uses are found via the CUDA_HOME environment variable (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):\n\nbash\n$ echo $CUDA_HOME\n/soft/datascience/cuda/cuda_11.5.2_495.29.05_linux\n\nIf you need to build applications that use this version of TensorFlow and CUDA, we recommend using these cuda libraries to ensure compatibility.  We periodically update the TensorFlow release, though updates will come in the form of new versions of the conda module.\n\nTensorFlow is also available through NVIDIA containers that have been translated to Singularity containers.  For more information about containers, please see the Containers documentation page.\n\nTensorFlow Best Practices on Polaris\n\nSingle Node Performance\n\nWhen running TensorFlow applications, we have found the following practices to be generally, if not universally, useful and encourage you to try some of these techniques to boost performance of your own applications.\n\nUse Reduced Precision. Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with TensorFlow operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the tf.keras.mixed_precision Policy, as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.

NVIDIA Nsight Compute provides a customizable and data-driven user interface,  metric collection, and can be extended with analysis scripts for post-processing results.\n\nStep-by-step guide\n\nCommon part on Polaris\n\nBuild your application for Polaris, and then submit your job script to Polaris or start an interactive job mode on Polaris as follows:\n\n```\n$ qsub -I -l select=1 -l walltime=1:00:00 -l filesystems=home:eagle -q debug -A\n\n$ module li\n\nCurrently Loaded Modules:\n  1) nvhpc/23.9          5) cray-pmi/6.1.13      9) PrgEnv-nvhpc/8.5.0      13) darshan/3.4.4\n  2) craype/2.7.30       6) cray-pals/1.3.4     10) libfabric/1.15.2.0\n  3) cray-dsmml/0.2.2    7) cray-libpals/1.3.4  11) craype-network-ofi\n  4) cray-mpich/8.1.28   8) craype-x86-milan    12) perftools-base/23.12.0\n\n$ nsys --version\nNVIDIA Nsight Systems version 2023.3.1.92-233133147223v0\n\n$ ncu --version\nNVIDIA (R) Nsight Compute Command Line Profiler\nCopyright (c) 2018-2023 NVIDIA Corporation\nVersion 2023.2.1.0 (build 33050884) (public-release)\nNVIDIA Nsight Systems version 2022.4.2.1-df9881f\n```\n\nNsight Systems\n\nRun your application with Nsight Systems as follows:\n\n$ nsys profile -o {output_filename} --stats=true ./{your_application}",

                "Compiling and Linking Overview on Polaris\n\nCompiling on Polaris Login and Compute Nodes\n\nIf your build system does not require GPUs for the build process, as is usually the case, compilation of GPU-accelerated codes is generally expected to work well on the Polaris login nodes. If your build system does require GPUs, you cannot yet compile on the Polaris login nodes, as they do not currently have GPUs installed. You may in this case compile your applications on the Polaris compute nodes. Do this by submitting an interactive single-node job, or running your build system in a batch job.\n\nHome File System\n\nIs it helpful to realize that there is a single HOME filesystem for users that can be accessed from the login and computes of each production resource at ALCF. Thus, users should be mindful of modifications to their environments (e.g. .bashrc) that may cause issues to arise due to differences between the systems.\n\nCray Programming Environment\n\nThe Cray Programming Environment (PE) uses three compiler wrappers for building software. These compiler wrappers should be used when building MPI-enabled applications.\n\ncc - C compiler\n\nCC - C++ compiler\n\nftn - Fortran compiler\n\nEach of these wrappers can select a specific vendor compiler based on the PrgEnv module loaded in the environment. The following are some helpful options to understand what the compiler wrapper is invoking.\n\n--craype-verbose : Print the command which is forwarded to the compiler invocation\n\n--cray-print-opts=libs : Print library information\n\n--cray-print-opts=cflags : Print include information\n\nThe output from these commands may be useful in build scripts where a compiler other than that invoked by a compiler wrapper is desired. Defining some variables as such may prove useful in those situations.\nCRAY_CFLAGS=$(cc --cray-print-opts=cflags)\nCRAY_LIB=$(cc --cray-print-opts=libs)\nFurther documentation and options are available via man cc and similar.\n\nCompilers provided by Cray Programming Environments",

                "Compiling and Linking Overview on Polaris\n\nCompiling on Polaris Login and Compute Nodes\n\nIf your build system does not require GPUs for the build process, as is usually the case, compilation of GPU-accelerated codes is generally expected to work well on the Polaris login nodes. If your build system does require GPUs, you cannot yet compile on the Polaris login nodes, as they do not currently have GPUs installed. You may in this case compile your applications on the Polaris compute nodes. Do this by submitting an interactive single-node job, or running your build system in a batch job.\n\nHome File System\n\nIs it helpful to realize that there is a single HOME filesystem for users that can be accessed from the login and computes of each production resource at ALCF. Thus, users should be mindful of modifications to their environments (e.g. .bashrc) that may cause issues to arise due to differences between the systems.\n\nCray Programming Environment\n\nThe Cray Programming Environment (PE) uses three compiler wrappers for building software. These compiler wrappers should be used when building MPI-enabled applications.\n\ncc - C compiler\n\nCC - C++ compiler\n\nftn - Fortran compiler\n\nEach of these wrappers can select a specific vendor compiler based on the PrgEnv module loaded in the environment. The following are some helpful options to understand what the compiler wrapper is invoking.\n\n--craype-verbose : Print the command which is forwarded to the compiler invocation\n\n--cray-print-opts=libs : Print library information\n\n--cray-print-opts=cflags : Print include information\n\nThe output from these commands may be useful in build scripts where a compiler other than that invoked by a compiler wrapper is desired. Defining some variables as such may prove useful in those situations.\nCRAY_CFLAGS=$(cc --cray-print-opts=cflags)\nCRAY_LIB=$(cc --cray-print-opts=libs)\nFurther documentation and options are available via man cc and similar.\n\nCompilers provided by Cray Programming Environments",

It consists of a base stack (spack-pe-base)\nand PrgEnv-dependent stacks (currently spack-pe-gnu).\n\nspack-pe-base contains commonplace software compiled for CPU with the system\nGCC compilers. Accordingly, the software in spack-pe-base can be used\nregardless of programming environment.\n\nspack-pe-gnu is based on the E4S Project and\nprovides performant HPC libraries built with PrgEnv-gnu and the nvcc CUDA\ncompiler driver for GPU code. spack-pe-gnu is dependent on both\nspack-pe-base and PrgEnv-gnu.\n\nUsing software from the Spack PE\n\nThe base suite of software tools and libraries can be accessed by loading the\nspack-pe-base module. This adds a path to $MODULEPATH which contains\nnumerous modules.\n\nFor example, to load cmake starting from the default environment, a user\nshould run the following commands:\nmodule use /soft/modulefiles\nmodule load spack-pe-base\nmodule load cmake\n\nThe spack-pe-base module adds paths to the user's MODULEPATH; individual packages are subsequently loaded through the newly available modules. The full list of available packages can be viewed by running module avail or module --show-hidden avail for a complete listing. Packages are loaded in the same way from spack-pe-gnu.\n\nInspecting packages\n\nWhen a module in the Spack PE is loaded, several environment variables are\nupdated to integrate the package into the user's environment. Additionally, the\nPACKAGE_ROOT variable is set to the path to the installation prefix of the\npackage. For example, after loading cmake as above:\n\n$ echo $CMAKE_ROOT\n/soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/install/linux-sles15-x86_64/gcc-12.3.0/cmake-3.27.7-a435jtzvweeos2es6enirbxdjdqhqgdp/\n$ ls -a $CMAKE_ROOT\n.  ..  bin  doc  share  .spack",

A Balsam Site runs on a node with access to the job scheduler, where it can submit and monitor jobs. Overall job state is aggregated on the Balsam Server, making job data from all Sites accessible from any individual site (or the user's laptop), via the command-line interface or the Python API. To get information on how to use the command line tool, you can type balsam --help in your shell.\n\nFull documentation for Balsam is available online.\n\nBalsam requires Python 3.7+. To install Balsam on Polaris, first set up a virtual Python environment:\n\nshell\nmodule load conda\nconda activate base\npython -m venv env\nsource env/bin/activate\npip install --upgrade pip\npip install --pre balsam\n\nTo use Balsam, users need an account on the Balsam server.  Users can get an account by contacting the ALCF Help Desk.  Once a user has an account, they can login and make a new site.  A Balsam site is a project space for your workflow. You will be prompted to select what machine (Polaris) you are working on when creating a new site:\n\nshell\nbalsam login\nbalsam site init -n new-site new-site\ncd new-site\nbalsam site start\n\nSee the Balsam documentation for full details.",

                "Use TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.  Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.  When possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention.\n\nUse XLA compilation on your code.  XLA is the Accelerated Linear Algebra library that is available in tensorFlow and critical in software like JAX.  XLA will compile a tf.Graph object, generated with tf.function or similar, and perform optimizations like operation-fusion.  XLA can give impressive performance boosts with almost no user changes except to set an environment variable TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2.  If your code is complex, or has dynamically sized tensors (tensors where the shape changes every iteration), XLA can be detrimental: the overhead for compiling functions can be large enough to mitigate performance improvements.  XLA is particularly powerful when combined with reduced precision, yielding speedups > 100% in some models.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nTensorFlow is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with tensorFlow has been seen with horovod in particular.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation.  Some polaris specific details that may be helpful to you:\n\nCPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.  In particular, we encourage users to try their scaling measurements with the following settings:\n\nSet the environment variable NCCL_COLLNET_ENABLE=1",

                "Mapping Programming Models to Polaris Modules\n\nThe table below offers some suggestions for how to get started setting up your environment on Polaris depending on the programming language and model. Note, mixed C/C++ and Fortran applications should choose the programming environment for the Fortran compiler because of mpi.mod and similar incompatibilities between Fortran-generated files from different compilers. Several simple examples for testing the software environment on Polaris for different programming models are available in the ALCF GettingStart repo.\n\nNote, users are encouraged to use PrgEnv-nvhpc instead of PrgEnv-nvidia as the latter will soon be deprecated in Cray's PE. They are otherwise identical pointing to compilers from the same NVIDIA SDK version.\n\nProgramming Language GPU Programming Model Likely used Modules/Compilers Notes C/C++ CUDA PrgEnv-nvhpc, PrgEnv-gnu, llvm NVIDIA (nvcc, nvc, nvc++) and clang compilers do GPU code generation C/C++ HIP N/A need to install with support for A100 C/C++ Kokkos See CUDA HIP, OpenMP, and SYCL/DPC++ also candidates C/C++ OpenACC PrgEnv-nvhpc C/C++ OpenCL PrgEnv-nvhpc, PrgEnv-gnu, llvm JIT GPU code generation C/C++ OpenMP PrgEnv-nvhpc, llvm C/C++ RAJA See CUDA HIP, OpenMP, and SYCL/DPC++ also candidates C/C++ SYCL/DPC++ llvm-sycl  Fortran CUDA PrgEnv-nvhpc NVIDIA compiler (nvfortran) does GPU code generation; gfortran can be loaded via gcc-mixed Fortran HIP N/A need to install with support for A100 Fortran OpenACC PrgEnv-nvhpc Fortran OpenCL PrgEnv-nvhpc, PrgEnv-gnu JIT GPU code generation Fortran OpenMP PrgEnv-nvhpc",

This consists of running the ParaView client on your local resource, and the ParaView server on the Polaris compute nodes. The ParaView client needs to first be installed on your local resource, and needs to match the version that you run on Polaris.\n\nThere are multiple versions of ParaView installed on Polaris. To find the versions of ParaView currently available on Polaris run the following command on a login node: \nmodule use /soft/modulefiles\nmodule avail paraview\n\nBinary and source packages of the ParaView client for Linux, MacOS, and Windows are available from the ParaView Download Page.\n\nConnecting to the ParaView server on Polaris\n\nThis section describes how to launch the ParaView server on Polaris from a local ParaView client.\n\nStart ParaView Client\n\nFirst, launch the ParaView client on your local resource. You will need to configure some server settings in the client. This initial set up should only need to be done once, and can be reused each time you want to run ParaView on Polaris.\n\nServer Configuration\n\n1. Select Connect\n\nFrom the ParaView client choose to connect to a server by either clicking on the \"Connect\" icon in the menu bar\n\nor selecting File->Connect from the main menu\n\n2. Set Up Servers (first time only)\n\nThe first time you want to run a server on Polaris and have it connect to your local ParaView client, you will need to set up a Server. Once this server is set up, you can reuse it each time you run the ParaView client with the ParaView server on Polaris.\n\nKitware, the developers of ParaView, maintain a database of server configurations which you can retrieve through the ParaView client. In the File->Connect menu press the button named \"Fetch Servers\" and select POLARIS@ANL. Windows users should select \"windows to POLARIS@ANL\". Press \"Import Selected\"\n\n3. Use ParaView",

                "Running Multiple MPI Applications on a node\n\nMultiple applications can be run simultaneously on a node by launching several mpiexec commands and backgrounding them. For performance, it will likely be necessary to ensure that each application runs on a distinct set of CPU resources and/or targets specific GPUs. One can provide a list of CPUs using the --cpu-bind option, which when combined with CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES provides a user with specifying exactly which CPU and GPU resources to run each application on. In the example below, four instances of the application are simultaneously running on a single node. In the first instance, the application is spawning MPI ranks 0-7 on CPUs 24-31 and using GPU 0. This mapping is based on output from the nvidia-smi topo -m command and pairs CPUs with the closest GPU.\n\n```bash\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:24:25:26:27:28:29:30:31 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:16:17:18:19:20:21:22:23 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:8:9:10:11:12:13:14:15 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=3\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:0:1:2:3:4:5:6:7 ./hello_affinity &\n\nwait\n```\n\nCompute Node Access to the Internet\n\nCurrently, the only access the internet is via a proxy.

For this reason, it is recommended to use start_method=\"spawn\" on Polaris when using the MpiExecLauncher as is shown in the example config above.  Alternatively, another solution is to use the GNUParallelLauncher which uses GNU Parallel to spawn processes.  GNU Parallel can be loaded in your environment with the command module load gnu-parallel.  Both of these approaches will circumvent the hang issue from using fork.\n\nUpdates\n\nFor parsl versions after July 2023, the address passed in the HighThroughputExecutor needs to be set to address = address_by_interface(\"bond0\").  With parsl versions prior to July 2023, it was recommended to use address = address_by_hostname() on Polaris, but with later versions this will not work on Polaris (or any other machine).",

In general, the way to do this is via the PyTorch Automatic Mixed Precision package (AMP), as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  In PyTorch, users generally need to manage casting and loss scaling manually,  though context managers and function decorators can provide easy tools to do this.\n\nPyTorch has a JIT module as well as backends to support op fusion, similar to TensorFlow's tf.function tools.

The ParaView client needs to first be installed on your local resource, and needs to match the version that you run on Polaris.\n\nThere are multiple versions of ParaView installed on Polaris. To find the versions of ParaView currently available on Polaris run the following command on a login node: \nmodule use /soft/modulefiles\nmodule avail paraview\n\nBinary and source packages of the ParaView client for Linux, MacOS, and Windows are available from the ParaView Download Page.\n\nConnecting to the ParaView server on Polaris\n\nThis section describes how to launch the ParaView server on Polaris from a local ParaView client.\n\nStart ParaView Client\n\nFirst, launch the ParaView client on your local resource. You will need to configure some server settings in the client. This initial set up should only need to be done once, and can be reused each time you want to run ParaView on Polaris.\n\nServer Configuration\n\n1. Select Connect\n\nFrom the ParaView client choose to connect to a server by either clicking on the \"Connect\" icon in the menu bar\n\nor selecting File->Connect from the main menu\n\n2. Set Up Servers (first time only)\n\nThe first time you want to run a server on Polaris and have it connect to your local ParaView client, you will need to set up a Server. Once this server is set up, you can reuse it each time you run the ParaView client with the ParaView server on Polaris.\n\nKitware, the developers of ParaView, maintain a database of server configurations which you can retrieve through the ParaView client.

If your build system does require GPUs, you cannot yet compile on the Polaris login nodes, as they do not currently have GPUs installed. You may in this case compile your applications on the Polaris compute nodes. Do this by submitting an interactive single-node job, or running your build system in a batch job.\n\nHome File System\n\nIs it helpful to realize that there is a single HOME filesystem for users that can be accessed from the login and computes of each production resource at ALCF. Thus, users should be mindful of modifications to their environments (e.g. .bashrc) that may cause issues to arise due to differences between the systems.\n\nCray Programming Environment\n\nThe Cray Programming Environment (PE) uses three compiler wrappers for building software. These compiler wrappers should be used when building MPI-enabled applications.\n\ncc - C compiler\n\nCC - C++ compiler\n\nftn - Fortran compiler\n\nEach of these wrappers can select a specific vendor compiler based on the PrgEnv module loaded in the environment.

Defining some variables as such may prove useful in those situations.\nCRAY_CFLAGS=$(cc --cray-print-opts=cflags)\nCRAY_LIB=$(cc --cray-print-opts=libs)\nFurther documentation and options are available via man cc and similar.\n\nCompilers provided by Cray Programming Environments",

        "cot_answer": "To manage casting and loss scaling manually in PyTorch, you can use context managers and function decorators. According to the context, ##\"In general, the way to do this is via the PyTorch Automatic Mixed Precision package (AMP), as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.\"## However, it seems that you want to manage casting and loss scaling manually.\n\nTo achieve this, you can use PyTorch's dynamic control flow. You can create a context manager or a function decorator that checks the data type of your tensors and applies the necessary casting and loss scaling operations.\n\nHere is an example of how you could implement this:\n\n```\nclass CastAndScale:\n    def __enter__(self):\n        # Apply casting and loss scaling here\n        pass\n\n    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):\n        # Clean up any resources used by the context manager\n        pass\n\ndef cast_and_scale(func):\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        # Apply casting and loss scaling before calling the function\n        result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n        # Apply casting and loss scaling after calling the function\n        return result\n    return wrapper\n\n# Example usage:\n@cast_and_scale\ndef my_model(input_data):\n    # Your model code here\n    pass\n\nwith CastAndScale():\n    my_model(some_input_data)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `CastAndScale` context manager and the `cast_and_scale` function decorator are used to apply casting and loss scaling operations around your model's forward pass.\n\nFinal Answer: <ANSWER>: Use PyTorch's dynamic control flow with context managers or function decorators to manage casting and loss scaling manually."

First, you need to understand that `--cpu-bind` is used to manually set the CPU affinity. This means you'll specify which CPUs (or cores) each MPI process should run on.\n\n##begin_quote##\nManually set the CPU affinity via mpiexec, such as with --cpu-bind verbose,list:0,8,16,24\n##end_quote##\n\n2. The `--cpu-bind` option takes a format of `verbose,list:<list_of_cores>`. In this case, you're specifying that each MPI process should run on cores 0, 8, 16, and 24.\n\n3. To use this option with mpiexec, you'll need to specify it along with the other options required for your specific use case (e.g., executable name, number of processes, etc.).\n\n4. For example, if you're using Horovod, you might use a command like:\n```\nmpiexec -n 4 --cpu-bind verbose,list:0,8,16,24 python train.py\n```\nThis would run four MPI processes, each bound to the specified cores.\n\n<ANSWER>: $--cpu-bind verbose,list:0,8,16,24"

JAX is built on XLA (the same XLA TensorFlow uses) as well as AutoGrad, and additionally has acceleration tools that operate on functions such as vmap, jit, etc.  JAX is not as widespread in machine learning as TensorFlow and PyTorch for traditional models (Computer Vision, Language Models) though it is quickly gaining promienence.  JAX is very powerful when a program needs non-traditional autodifferentiation or vectorizatoin, such as: forward-mode AD, higher order derivatives, Jacobians, Hessians, or any combination of the above.  Users of JAX on Polaris are encouraged to read the user documentation in detail, particularly the details about pure-functional programming, no in-place operations, and the common mistakes in writing functions for the @jit decorator.\n\nJAX on Polaris\n\nJAX is installed on Polaris via the conda module, available with:\nbash\nmodule load conda; conda activate\n\nThen, you can load JAX in python as usual (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):\n\n```python\n\nimport jax\njax.version\n'0.3.15'\n\n```\n\nNotes on JAX 0.3.15\n\nOn Polaris, due to a bug, an environment variable must be set to use JAX on GPUs.  The following code will crash:\npython\nimport jax.numpy as numpy\na = numpy.zeros(1000)\noutputting an error that looks like:\npython\njaxlib.xla_extension.XlaRuntimeError: UNKNOWN: no kernel image is available for execution on the device\n\nYou can fix this by setting an environment variable:\nbash\nexport XLA_FLAGS=\"--xla_gpu_force_compilation_parallelism=1\"\n\nScaling JAX to multiple GPUs and multiple Nodes\n\nJax has intrinsic scaling tools to use multiple GPUs on a single node, via the pmap function.  If this is sufficient for your needs, excellent.  If not, another alternative is to use the newer package mpi4jax.",
        "question": "Why does setting an environment variable XLA_FLAGS=\"--xla_gpu_force_compilation_parallelism=1\" solve a problem when using JAX?",
        "cot_answer": "Here's my step-by-step reasoning to answer the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem**\nThe context mentions that setting an environment variable `XLA_FLAGS=\"--xla_gpu_force_compilation_parallelism=1\"` solves a problem when using JAX. The problem is described as \"an error that looks like: `jaxlib.xla_extension.XlaRuntimeError: UNKNOWN: no kernel image is available for execution on the device`\".\n\n**Step 2: Identify the relevant information**\nThe context mentions that this issue occurs due to a bug in JAX 0.3.15, which is installed on Polaris via conda.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the solution**\nThe solution involves setting an environment variable `XLA_FLAGS=\"--xla_gpu_force_compilation_parallelism=1\"`.\n\n**Step 4: Connect the dots**\nBy reading the context, we can infer that this environment variable is related to XLA (the same XLA TensorFlow uses) and JAX. The quote from the context mentions that \"On Polaris, due to a bug, an environment variable must be set to use JAX on GPUs.\" This suggests that setting the `XLA_FLAGS` environment variable is necessary to fix the issue.\n\n**Final Answer**\n<ANSWER>: Setting the `XLA_FLAGS` environment variable `--xla_gpu_force_compilation_parallelism=1` solves a problem when using JAX because it fixes a bug in JAX 0.3.15 that prevents kernel image compilation on GPUs, allowing JAX to run correctly on Polaris."

                "Use TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.  Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.  When possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention.\n\nUse XLA compilation on your code.  XLA is the Accelerated Linear Algebra library that is available in tensorFlow and critical in software like JAX.  XLA will compile a tf.Graph object, generated with tf.function or similar, and perform optimizations like operation-fusion.  XLA can give impressive performance boosts with almost no user changes except to set an environment variable TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2.  If your code is complex, or has dynamically sized tensors (tensors where the shape changes every iteration), XLA can be detrimental: the overhead for compiling functions can be large enough to mitigate performance improvements.  XLA is particularly powerful when combined with reduced precision, yielding speedups > 100% in some models.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nTensorFlow is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with tensorFlow has been seen with horovod in particular.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation.  Some polaris specific details that may be helpful to you:\n\nCPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.  In particular, we encourage users to try their scaling measurements with the following settings:\n\nSet the environment variable NCCL_COLLNET_ENABLE=1",

If your build system does require GPUs, you cannot yet compile on the Polaris login nodes, as they do not currently have GPUs installed. You may in this case compile your applications on the Polaris compute nodes. Do this by submitting an interactive single-node job, or running your build system in a batch job.\n\nHome File System\n\nIs it helpful to realize that there is a single HOME filesystem for users that can be accessed from the login and computes of each production resource at ALCF. Thus, users should be mindful of modifications to their environments (e.g. .bashrc) that may cause issues to arise due to differences between the systems.\n\nCray Programming Environment\n\nThe Cray Programming Environment (PE) uses three compiler wrappers for building software. These compiler wrappers should be used when building MPI-enabled applications.\n\ncc - C compiler\n\nCC - C++ compiler\n\nftn - Fortran compiler\n\nEach of these wrappers can select a specific vendor compiler based on the PrgEnv module loaded in the environment. The following are some helpful options to understand what the compiler wrapper is invoking.\n\n--craype-verbose : Print the command which is forwarded to the compiler invocation\n\n--cray-print-opts=libs : Print library information\n\n--cray-print-opts=cflags : Print include information\n\nThe output from these commands may be useful in build scripts where a compiler other than that invoked by a compiler wrapper is desired. Defining some variables as such may prove useful in those situations.\nCRAY_CFLAGS=$(cc --cray-print-opts=cflags)\nCRAY_LIB=$(cc --cray-print-opts=libs)\nFurther documentation and options are available via man cc and similar.\n\nCompilers provided by Cray Programming Environments",

            "Use TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.  Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.  When possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention.\n\nUse XLA compilation on your code.  XLA is the Accelerated Linear Algebra library that is available in tensorFlow and critical in software like JAX.  XLA will compile a tf.Graph object, generated with tf.function or similar, and perform optimizations like operation-fusion.  XLA can give impressive performance boosts with almost no user changes except to set an environment variable TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2.  If your code is complex, or has dynamically sized tensors (tensors where the shape changes every iteration), XLA can be detrimental: the overhead for compiling functions can be large enough to mitigate performance improvements.  XLA is particularly powerful when combined with reduced precision, yielding speedups > 100% in some models.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nTensorFlow is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with tensorFlow has been seen with horovod in particular.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation.

                "Use Reduced Precision. Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with PyTorch operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the PyTorch Automatic Mixed Precision package (AMP), as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  In PyTorch, users generally need to manage casting and loss scaling manually,  though context managers and function decorators can provide easy tools to do this.\n\nPyTorch has a JIT module as well as backends to support op fusion, similar to TensorFlow's tf.function tools.  However, PyTorch JIT capabilities are newer and may not yield performance improvements.  Please see TorchScript for more information.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nPyTorch is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with PyTorch has been seen with both DDP and Horovod.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation or the Distributed Data Parallel documentation.  Some Polaris-specific details that may be helpful to you:\n\nCPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.  In particular, we encourage users to try their scaling measurements with the following settings:\n\nSet the environment variable NCCL_COLLNET_ENABLE=1\n\nSet the environment varialbe NCCL_NET_GDR_LEVEL=PHB\n\nManually set the CPU affinity via mpiexec, such as with --cpu-bind verbose,list:0,8,16,24",

According to the context, XLA is the Accelerated Linear Algebra library that can compile a tf.Graph object generated with tf.function or similar and perform optimizations like operation-fusion.\n\nFirstly, it's necessary to understand that XLA compilation is used to improve efficiency of operations. This can be achieved by using the `tf.function` decorator in TensorFlow, which replaces Python functions with lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow graphs.\n\n##begin_quote##\nWhen possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention.\n##end_quote##\n\nTo use XLA compilation on your code, you can set an environment variable `TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2`.

Many tools exist to address this, of which parsl is just one.  On this page, we'll highlight some of the key pieces of information about parsl that are relevant to Polaris.  Parsl is also extensively documented, has a dedicated Slack Channel, and a large community of users and developers beyond ALCF.  We encourage you to engage with the parsl community for support with parsl specific questions, and for Polaris-specific questions or problems, please contact support@alcf.anl.gov.\n\nGetting Parsl on Polaris\n\nYou can install parsl building off of the conda modules.  You have some flexibility in how you want to extend the conda module to include parsl, but here is an example way to do it:\n\n```python\n\nLoad the Conda Module (needed everytime you use parsl)\n\nmodule load conda\nconda activate\n\nCreate a virtual env that uses the conda env as the system packages.\n\nOnly do the next line on initial set up:\n\npython -m venv --system-site-packages /path/to/your/virtualenv\n\nLoad the virtual env (every time):\n\nsource /path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/activate\n\nInstall parsl (only once)\n\npip install parsl\n\n```\n\nUsing Parsl on Polaris\n\nParsl has a variety of possible configuration settings.  As an example, we provide the configuration below that will run one task per GPU:\n\n```python\nfrom parsl.config import Config\n\nPBSPro is the right provider for Polaris:\n\nfrom parsl.providers import PBSProProvider\n\nThe high throughput executor is for scaling to HPC systems:\n\nfrom parsl.executors import HighThroughputExecutor\n\nYou can use the MPI launcher, but may want the Gnu Parallel launcher, see below\n\nfrom parsl.launchers import MpiExecLauncher, GnuParallelLauncher\n\naddress_by_interface is needed for the HighThroughputExecutor:",

This enables developers to debug applications without the potential variations introduced by simulation and emulation environments.\n\nStep-by-step guide\n\nDebug Compilation\n\nNVCC, the NVIDIA CUDA compiler driver, provides a mechanism for generating the debugging information necessary for CUDA-GDB to work properly. The -g -G option pair must be passed to NVCC when an application is compiled for ease of debugging with CUDA-GDB; for example,\nnvcc -g -G foo.cu -o foo\nUsing this line to compile the CUDA application foo.cu\n* forces -O0 compilation, with the exception of very limited dead-code eliminations and register-spilling optimizations.\n* makes the compiler include debug information in the executable\n\nRunning CUDA-gdb on Polaris compute nodes\n\nStart an interactive job mode on Polaris as follows:\n\n```\n$ qsub -I -l select=1 -l walltime=1:00:00\n\n$ cuda-gdb --version\nNVIDIA (R) CUDA Debugger\n11.4 release\nPortions Copyright (C) 2007-2021 NVIDIA Corporation\nGNU gdb (GDB) 10.1\nCopyright (C) 2020 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nLicense GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html\nThis is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.\nThere is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.\n\n$ cuda-gdb foo\n```\n\nA quick example with a stream benchmark on a Polaris compute node\n\n```\njkwack@polaris-login-02:~> qsub -I -l select=1 -l walltime=1:00:00\nqsub: waiting for job 308834.polaris-pbs-01.hsn.cm.polaris.alcf.anl.gov to start\nqsub: job 308834.polaris-pbs-01.hsn.cm.polaris.alcf.anl.gov ready",

                "Use Reduced Precision. Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with PyTorch operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the PyTorch Automatic Mixed Precision package (AMP), as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  In PyTorch, users generally need to manage casting and loss scaling manually,  though context managers and function decorators can provide easy tools to do this.\n\nPyTorch has a JIT module as well as backends to support op fusion, similar to TensorFlow's tf.function tools.  However, PyTorch JIT capabilities are newer and may not yield performance improvements.  Please see TorchScript for more information.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nPyTorch is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with PyTorch has been seen with both DDP and Horovod.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation or the Distributed Data Parallel documentation.  Some Polaris-specific details that may be helpful to you:\n\nCPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.  In particular, we encourage users to try their scaling measurements with the following settings:\n\nSet the environment variable NCCL_COLLNET_ENABLE=1\n\nSet the environment varialbe NCCL_NET_GDR_LEVEL=PHB\n\nManually set the CPU affinity via mpiexec, such as with --cpu-bind verbose,list:0,8,16,24",

It is primarily designed for biochemical molecules like proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids that have a lot of complicated bonded interactions, but since GROMACS is extremely fast at calculating the nonbonded interactions (that usually dominate simulations) many groups are also using it for research on non-biological systems, e.g. polymers.\n\nUsing GROMACS at ALCF\n\nALCF offers assistance with building binaries and compiling instructions for GROMACS.

        "cot_answer": "<ANSWER>: The job submission script used for running containers on Polaris is a bash script that uses the PBS (Portable Batch System) commands to submit a job to the Polaris cluster. Here's how it works:\n\n1. The first line `#!/bin/sh` specifies the interpreter that should be used to run the script.\n2. The next few lines use PBS commands to specify various parameters for the job, such as:\n\t* `-l select=2:system=polaris`: This specifies that the job requires 2 nodes and that those nodes must be from the Polaris system.\n\t* `-q debug`: This specifies that the job should be run in the \"debug\" queue.\n\t* `-l place=scatter`: This specifies how the job should be placed on the nodes. In this case, it's being scattered across multiple nodes.\n\t* `-l walltime=0:30:00`: This specifies a maximum runtime of 30 minutes for the job.\n\t* `-l filesystems=home:grand`: This specifies that the job requires access to the \"grand\" filesystem on the home directory.\n3. The next line `PBS -A` specifies that the job should be run in the specified project (in this case, `<Project>`).\n4. The script then changes into the current working directory (`cd ${PBS_O_WORKDIR}`) and sets a variable `CONTAINER` to the name of the container being run.\n5. Finally, the script loads Apptainer and enables network access at runtime by setting the proxy.\n\nThe final answer is: <ANSWER>: The job submission script used for running containers on Polaris."

The specification describes directives, runtime routines, and environment variables that allow an application developer to express parallelism (e.g. shared memory multiprocessing and device offloading). Many compiler vendors provide implementations of the OpenMP specification (https://www.openmp.org/specifications).\n\nSetting the environment to use OpenMP on Polaris\n\nMany of the programming environments available on Polaris have OpenMP support.\n\nmodule OpenMP CPU support? OpenMP GPU support? PrgEnv-nvhpc yes yes llvm yes yes PrgEnv-gnu yes no PrgEnv-cray yes yes*\n\nCurrently PrgEnv-cray is not recommended for OpenMP offload.\n\nBy default, the PrgEnv-nvhpc module is loaded. To switch to other modules, you can use module switch.\n\nUsing PrgEnv-nvhpc\n\nThis is loaded by default, so there's no need to load additional modules. You can confirm that it is loaded by running module list to check that PrgEnv-nvhpc is in the list.\n\nUsing LLVM\n\nTo use the LLVM module, load the following.\nmodule load mpiwrappers/cray-mpich-llvm\nmodule load cudatoolkit-standalone\n\nSee the the LLVM compiling page here for more information.\n\nUsing PrgEnv-gnu\n\nTo switch from PrgEnv-nvhpc to PrgEnv-gnu you can run:\n\nmodule switch PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-gnu\n\nThe gcc/gfortran on Polaris was not built with GPU support. To use OpenMP on the CPU, you need to unload craype-accel-nvidia80:\n\nmodule unload craype-accel-nvidia80\n\nUsing PrgEnv-cray\n\nTo switch from PrgEnv-nvhpc to PrgEnv-cray you can run:\n\nmodule switch PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-cray\n\nTo use OpenMP on the CPU only, also unload craype-accel-nvidia80:\n\nmodule unload craype-accel-nvidia80\n\nTo use OpenMP on the GPU, load cudatoolkit-standalone, although this is not recommended at the moment.\nmodule load cudatoolkit-standalone\n\nBuilding on Polaris",

Obviously, that gets tedious for large jobs.\n\nIf you want to control the location of a few nodes, for example 2 out of 64, but the rest don't matter, you can do something like this: -l select=1:vnode=<node name1>+1:vnode=<node name2>+62:system=foo\n\nEvery node has a PBS resource called tier0 with a rack identifier and tier1 with a dragonfly group identifieer.  If you want all your nodes grouped in a rack, you can add the group specifier -l select=8:system=foo,place=scatter:group=tier0.  If you wanted everything in the same dragonfly group, replace tier0 with tier1.  Note that you have to also explicitly specify the place when you use group.  If you wanted a specific rack or dragonfly group instead of any of them, you are back to the select: -l select 10:tier0=x3001-g0.\n\nNetwork: Rack and Dragonfly Group Mappings\n\nRacks contain (7) 6U chassis; each chassis has 2 nodes for 14 nodes per rack\n\nThe hostnames are of the form xRRPPc0sUUb[0|1]n0 where:\nRR is the row {30, 31, 32}\nPP is the position in the row {30 goes 1-16, 31 and 32 go 1-12}\nc is chassis and is always 0\ns stands for slot, but in this case is the RU in the rack and values are {1,7,13,19,25,31,37}\nb is BMC controller and is 0 or 1 (each node has its own BMC)\nn is node, but is always 0 since there is only one node per BMC\n\nSo, 16+12+12 = 40 racks * 14 nodes per rack = 560 nodes.\n\nNote that in production group 9 (the last 4 racks) will be the designated on-demand racks\n\nThe management racks are x3000 and X3100 and are dragonfly group 10\n\nThe TDS rack is x3200 and is dragonfly group 11",

It consists of a base stack (spack-pe-base)\nand PrgEnv-dependent stacks (currently spack-pe-gnu).\n\nspack-pe-base contains commonplace software compiled for CPU with the system\nGCC compilers. Accordingly, the software in spack-pe-base can be used\nregardless of programming environment.\n\nspack-pe-gnu is based on the E4S Project and\nprovides performant HPC libraries built with PrgEnv-gnu and the nvcc CUDA\ncompiler driver for GPU code. spack-pe-gnu is dependent on both\nspack-pe-base and PrgEnv-gnu.\n\nUsing software from the Spack PE\n\nThe base suite of software tools and libraries can be accessed by loading the\nspack-pe-base module. This adds a path to $MODULEPATH which contains\nnumerous modules.\n\nFor example, to load cmake starting from the default environment, a user\nshould run the following commands:\nmodule use /soft/modulefiles\nmodule load spack-pe-base\nmodule load cmake\n\nThe spack-pe-base module adds paths to the user's MODULEPATH; individual packages are subsequently loaded through the newly available modules. The full list of available packages can be viewed by running module avail or module --show-hidden avail for a complete listing. Packages are loaded in the same way from spack-pe-gnu.\n\nInspecting packages\n\nWhen a module in the Spack PE is loaded, several environment variables are\nupdated to integrate the package into the user's environment. Additionally, the\nPACKAGE_ROOT variable is set to the path to the installation prefix of the\npackage. For example, after loading cmake as above:\n\n$ echo $CMAKE_ROOT\n/soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/install/linux-sles15-x86_64/gcc-12.3.0/cmake-3.27.7-a435jtzvweeos2es6enirbxdjdqhqgdp/\n$ ls -a $CMAKE_ROOT\n.  ..  bin  doc  share  .spack",

For performance, it will likely be necessary to ensure that each application runs on a distinct set of CPU resources and/or targets specific GPUs. One can provide a list of CPUs using the --cpu-bind option, which when combined with CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES provides a user with specifying exactly which CPU and GPU resources to run each application on. In the example below, four instances of the application are simultaneously running on a single node. In the first instance, the application is spawning MPI ranks 0-7 on CPUs 24-31 and using GPU 0. This mapping is based on output from the nvidia-smi topo -m command and pairs CPUs with the closest GPU.\n\n```bash\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:24:25:26:27:28:29:30:31 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:16:17:18:19:20:21:22:23 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:8:9:10:11:12:13:14:15 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=3\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:0:1:2:3:4:5:6:7 ./hello_affinity &\n\nwait\n```\n\nCompute Node Access to the Internet\n\nCurrently, the only access the internet is via a proxy.

        "cot_answer": "To answer this question, I will provide step-by-step reasoning based on the given context.\n\nReasoning:\n\n1. The first step is to check if there are any unnecessary files that can be deleted to free up quota. This is mentioned in the context: \"Check your quota and delete any unnecessary files.\" ##begin_quote## Check your quota and delete any unnecessary files. ##end_quote##\n2. If deleting unnecessary files does not resolve the issue, the next step would be to clean-up apptainer cache, ~/.apptainer/cache, and set the apptainer tmp and cache directories as mentioned in the context: \"Clean-up apptainer cache, ~/.apptainer/cache, and set the apptainer tmp and cache directories as below:\" ##begin_quote## Clean-up apptainer cache, ~/.apptainer/cache, and set the apptainer tmp and cache directories as below: bash export APPTAINER_TMPDIR=/tmp/apptainer-tmpdir mkdir $APPTAINER_TMPDIR export APPTAINER_CACHEDIR=/tmp/apptainer-cachedir/ mkdir $APPTANNER_CACHEDIR ##end_quote##\n3. If the above steps do not resolve the issue, it is possible that the directory being accessed is a symlink. In this case, checking if `pwd` and `pwd -P` return the same path can help identify the issue: \"Make sure you are not on a directory accessed with a symlink, i.e. check if pwd and pwd -P returns the same path.\" ##begin_quote## Make sure you are not on a directory accessed with a symlink, i.e. check if pwd and pwd -P returns the same path. ##end_quote##\n4. If none of the above steps resolve the issue, it may be necessary to run the build in the home directory: \"If any of the above doesn't work, try running the build in your home directory.\" ##begin_quote## If any of the above doesn't work, try running the build in your home directory. ##end_quote##\n5. Finally, if the issue persists, it may be related to MPI alignment or OpenMPI dependency: \"Mapping to rank 0 on all nodes: Ensure that the container's MPI aligns with the system MPI. Follow the additional steps outlined in the container registry documentation for MPI on Polaris\" and \"libmpi.so.40 not found: This can happen if the container's application has an OpenMPI dependency which is not currently supported on Polaris.\" ##begin_quote## Mapping to rank 0 on all nodes: Ensure that the container's MPI aligns with the system MPI. Follow the additional steps outlined in the container registry documentation for MPI on Polaris libmpi.so.40 not found: This can happen if the container's application has an OpenMPI dependency which is not currently supported on Polaris. ##end_quote##\n\nFinal Answer:\n<ANSWER>: The common causes of permission errors during the build process of a supercomputer are unnecessary files, apptainer cache issues, symlink directories, and MPI alignment or OpenMPI dependency problems."

For this reason, it is recommended to use start_method=\"spawn\" on Polaris when using the MpiExecLauncher as is shown in the example config above.  Alternatively, another solution is to use the GNUParallelLauncher which uses GNU Parallel to spawn processes.  GNU Parallel can be loaded in your environment with the command module load gnu-parallel.  Both of these approaches will circumvent the hang issue from using fork.\n\nUpdates\n\nFor parsl versions after July 2023, the address passed in the HighThroughputExecutor needs to be set to address = address_by_interface(\"bond0\").  With parsl versions prior to July 2023, it was recommended to use address = address_by_hostname() on Polaris, but with later versions this will not work on Polaris (or any other machine).",

If your build system does require GPUs, you cannot yet compile on the Polaris login nodes, as they do not currently have GPUs installed. You may in this case compile your applications on the Polaris compute nodes. Do this by submitting an interactive single-node job, or running your build system in a batch job.\n\nHome File System\n\nIs it helpful to realize that there is a single HOME filesystem for users that can be accessed from the login and computes of each production resource at ALCF. Thus, users should be mindful of modifications to their environments (e.g. .bashrc) that may cause issues to arise due to differences between the systems.\n\nCray Programming Environment\n\nThe Cray Programming Environment (PE) uses three compiler wrappers for building software. These compiler wrappers should be used when building MPI-enabled applications.\n\ncc - C compiler\n\nCC - C++ compiler\n\nftn - Fortran compiler\n\nEach of these wrappers can select a specific vendor compiler based on the PrgEnv module loaded in the environment. The following are some helpful options to understand what the compiler wrapper is invoking.\n\n--craype-verbose : Print the command which is forwarded to the compiler invocation\n\n--cray-print-opts=libs : Print library information\n\n--cray-print-opts=cflags : Print include information\n\nThe output from these commands may be useful in build scripts where a compiler other than that invoked by a compiler wrapper is desired. Defining some variables as such may prove useful in those situations.\nCRAY_CFLAGS=$(cc --cray-print-opts=cflags)\nCRAY_LIB=$(cc --cray-print-opts=libs)\nFurther documentation and options are available via man cc and similar.\n\nCompilers provided by Cray Programming Environments",

The Cray MPI wrappers will handle this automatically.\n\nNotes on Default Modules\n\ncraype-x86-rome: While the Polaris compute nodes currently have Milan CPUs, this module is loaded by default to avoid the craype-x86-milan module from adding a zen3 target not supported in the default nvhpc/21.9 compilers. The craype-x86-milan module is expected to be made default once a newer nvhpc version (e.g. 22.5) is made the default.\n\ncraype-accel-nvidia80: This module adds compiler flags to enable GPU acceleration for NVHPC compilers along with gpu-enabled MPI libraries as it is assumed that the majority of applications to be compiled on Polaris will target the GPUs for acceleration.

                "Use TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.  Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.  When possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention.\n\nUse XLA compilation on your code.  XLA is the Accelerated Linear Algebra library that is available in tensorFlow and critical in software like JAX.  XLA will compile a tf.Graph object, generated with tf.function or similar, and perform optimizations like operation-fusion.  XLA can give impressive performance boosts with almost no user changes except to set an environment variable TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2.  If your code is complex, or has dynamically sized tensors (tensors where the shape changes every iteration), XLA can be detrimental: the overhead for compiling functions can be large enough to mitigate performance improvements.  XLA is particularly powerful when combined with reduced precision, yielding speedups > 100% in some models.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nTensorFlow is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with tensorFlow has been seen with horovod in particular.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation.  Some polaris specific details that may be helpful to you:\n\nCPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.  In particular, we encourage users to try their scaling measurements with the following settings:\n\nSet the environment variable NCCL_COLLNET_ENABLE=1",

As such, the craype-accel-nvidia80 module is in the default environment.

For this reason, it is recommended to use start_method=\"spawn\" on Polaris when using the MpiExecLauncher as is shown in the example config above.  Alternatively, another solution is to use the GNUParallelLauncher which uses GNU Parallel to spawn processes.  GNU Parallel can be loaded in your environment with the command module load gnu-parallel.  Both of these approaches will circumvent the hang issue from using fork.\n\nUpdates\n\nFor parsl versions after July 2023, the address passed in the HighThroughputExecutor needs to be set to address = address_by_interface(\"bond0\").  With parsl versions prior to July 2023, it was recommended to use address = address_by_hostname() on Polaris, but with later versions this will not work on Polaris (or any other machine).",

Obviously, that gets tedious for large jobs.\n\nIf you want to control the location of a few nodes, for example 2 out of 64, but the rest don't matter, you can do something like this: -l select=1:vnode=<node name1>+1:vnode=<node name2>+62:system=foo\n\nEvery node has a PBS resource called tier0 with a rack identifier and tier1 with a dragonfly group identifieer.  If you want all your nodes grouped in a rack, you can add the group specifier -l select=8:system=foo,place=scatter:group=tier0.  If you wanted everything in the same dragonfly group, replace tier0 with tier1.  Note that you have to also explicitly specify the place when you use group.  If you wanted a specific rack or dragonfly group instead of any of them, you are back to the select: -l select 10:tier0=x3001-g0.\n\nNetwork: Rack and Dragonfly Group Mappings\n\nRacks contain (7) 6U chassis; each chassis has 2 nodes for 14 nodes per rack\n\nThe hostnames are of the form xRRPPc0sUUb[0|1]n0 where:\nRR is the row {30, 31, 32}\nPP is the position in the row {30 goes 1-16, 31 and 32 go 1-12}\nc is chassis and is always 0\ns stands for slot, but in this case is the RU in the rack and values are {1,7,13,19,25,31,37}\nb is BMC controller and is 0 or 1 (each node has its own BMC)\nn is node, but is always 0 since there is only one node per BMC\n\nSo, 16+12+12 = 40 racks * 14 nodes per rack = 560 nodes.\n\nNote that in production group 9 (the last 4 racks) will be the designated on-demand racks\n\nThe management racks are x3000 and X3100 and are dragonfly group 10\n\nThe TDS rack is x3200 and is dragonfly group 11",

Using the official Julia 1.9 binaries from the Julia\nwebpage is recommended.\nJuliaup provides a convenient way to\ninstall Julia and manage the various Julia versions. The default installation will install julia, juliaup, and other commands in a ${HOME}/.julia directory and update profile files like .bashrc to update PATH to include that directory. One can customize the installation to change these defaults.\n\nbash\nmodule load craype-accel-nvidia80\ncurl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh\n\nIf you chose a custom installation, then be sure to update the PATH environment variable appropriately.\n\nexport PATH=${HOME}/.juliaup/bin:${PATH}\n\nYou may then list the available Julia versions with juliaup list and install a\nspecific version with juliaup install <version>. You can then activate a\nspecific version with juliaup use <version> and set the default version with\njuliaup default <version>. juliaup update will update the installed Julia\nversions.

A Balsam Site runs on a node with access to the job scheduler, where it can submit and monitor jobs. Overall job state is aggregated on the Balsam Server, making job data from all Sites accessible from any individual site (or the user's laptop), via the command-line interface or the Python API. To get information on how to use the command line tool, you can type balsam --help in your shell.\n\nFull documentation for Balsam is available online.\n\nBalsam requires Python 3.7+. To install Balsam on Polaris, first set up a virtual Python environment:\n\nshell\nmodule load conda\nconda activate base\npython -m venv env\nsource env/bin/activate\npip install --upgrade pip\npip install --pre balsam\n\nTo use Balsam, users need an account on the Balsam server.  Users can get an account by contacting the ALCF Help Desk.  Once a user has an account, they can login and make a new site.  A Balsam site is a project space for your workflow. You will be prompted to select what machine (Polaris) you are working on when creating a new site:\n\nshell\nbalsam login\nbalsam site init -n new-site new-site\ncd new-site\nbalsam site start\n\nSee the Balsam documentation for full details.",

The PyTorch home page has more information about PyTorch, which you can refer to.  For trouble shooting on Polaris, please contact support@alcf.anl.gov.\n\nInstallation on Polaris\n\nPyTorch is installed on Polaris already, available in the conda module.  To use it from a compute node, please do:\n\nbash\nmodule load conda\nconda activate\n\nThen, you can load PyTorch in python as usual (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):\n\n```python\n\nimport torch\ntorch.version\n'1.12.0a0+git67ece03'\n\n```\n\nThis installation of PyTorch was built from source and the cuda libraries it uses are found via the CUDA_HOME environment variable (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):\n\nbash\n$ echo $CUDA_HOME\n/soft/datascience/cuda/cuda_11.5.2_495.29.05_linux\n\nIf you need to build applications that use this version of PyTorch and CUDA, we recommend using these cuda libraries to ensure compatibility.  We periodically update the PyTorch release, though updates will come in the form of new versions of the conda module.\n\nPyTorch is also available through nvidia containers that have been translated to Singularity containers.  For more information about containers, please see the containers documentation page.\n\nPyTorch Best Practices on Polaris\n\nSingle Node Performance\n\nWhen running PyTorch applications, we have found the following practices to be generally, if not universally, useful and encourage you to try some of these techniques to boost performance of your own applications.",

                "Use TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.  Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.  When possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention.\n\nUse XLA compilation on your code.  XLA is the Accelerated Linear Algebra library that is available in tensorFlow and critical in software like JAX.  XLA will compile a tf.Graph object, generated with tf.function or similar, and perform optimizations like operation-fusion.  XLA can give impressive performance boosts with almost no user changes except to set an environment variable TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2.  If your code is complex, or has dynamically sized tensors (tensors where the shape changes every iteration), XLA can be detrimental: the overhead for compiling functions can be large enough to mitigate performance improvements.  XLA is particularly powerful when combined with reduced precision, yielding speedups > 100% in some models.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nTensorFlow is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with tensorFlow has been seen with horovod in particular.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation.  Some polaris specific details that may be helpful to you:\n\nCPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.  In particular, we encourage users to try their scaling measurements with the following settings:\n\nSet the environment variable NCCL_COLLNET_ENABLE=1",

The file contains various settings and options for compiling code using the VASP (Vienna Ab-Initio Simulation Package) software. To answer this question, I will examine the contents of the makefile and look for any mentions of `makefile.include`.\n\n##begin_quote##\nThe follow makefile.include was tailored for Polaris, originally taken from here.\n##end_quote##\n\nFrom this quote, it is clear that `makefile.include` is mentioned as a file that has been tailored for Polaris. This suggests that `makefile.include` is likely an include file used to provide additional settings or options for the makefile.\n\nFurther examination of the makefile reveals that there are no explicit references to `makefile.include`. However, the presence of this file in the context and its mention as being tailored for Polaris implies that it is used to provide specific settings or options for the VASP software.\n\nFinal Answer:\n<ANSWER>: The `makefile.include` file appears to be an include file used to provide additional settings or options for the makefile, specifically tailored for the Polaris platform."

                "Gromacs on Polaris\n\nWhat is Gromacs?\n\nGROMACS is a versatile package to perform molecular dynamics, i.e. simulate the Newtonian equations of motion for systems with hundreds to millions of particles. It is primarily designed for biochemical molecules like proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids that have a lot of complicated bonded interactions, but since GROMACS is extremely fast at calculating the nonbonded interactions (that usually dominate simulations) many groups are also using it for research on non-biological systems, e.g. polymers.\n\nUsing GROMACS at ALCF\n\nALCF offers assistance with building binaries and compiling instructions for GROMACS.

                "Use Reduced Precision. Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with PyTorch operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the PyTorch Automatic Mixed Precision package (AMP), as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  In PyTorch, users generally need to manage casting and loss scaling manually,  though context managers and function decorators can provide easy tools to do this.\n\nPyTorch has a JIT module as well as backends to support op fusion, similar to TensorFlow's tf.function tools.  However, PyTorch JIT capabilities are newer and may not yield performance improvements.  Please see TorchScript for more information.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nPyTorch is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with PyTorch has been seen with both DDP and Horovod.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation or the Distributed Data Parallel documentation.  Some Polaris-specific details that may be helpful to you:\n\nCPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.  In particular, we encourage users to try their scaling measurements with the following settings:\n\nSet the environment variable NCCL_COLLNET_ENABLE=1\n\nSet the environment varialbe NCCL_NET_GDR_LEVEL=PHB\n\nManually set the CPU affinity via mpiexec, such as with --cpu-bind verbose,list:0,8,16,24",

This guide details the use of containers on Polaris, including custom container creation, large-scale execution, and common pitfalls.\n\nApptainer Setup\n\nPolaris employs Apptainer (formerly known as Singularity) for container management. To set up Apptainer, run:\n\nbash\nmodule use /soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/install/modulefiles/Core\nmodule load apptainer\napptainer version #1.2.2\n\nThe Apptainer version on Polaris is 1.2.2. Detailed user documentation is available here\n\nBuilding from Docker or Argonne GitHub Container Registry\n\nContainers on Polaris can be built by writing Dockerfiles on a local machine and then publish the container to DockerHub, or by directly building them on ALCF compute node by writing an Apptainer recipe file. If you prefer to use existing containers, you can pull them from various registries like DockerHub and run them on Polaris.\n\nSince Docker requires root privileges, which users do not have on Polaris, existing Docker containers must be converted to Apptainer. To build a Docker-based container on Polaris, use the following as an example:",

This is done by adding the include path and library paths for FFTW to the compiler flags.\n\nFrom the context, we can see that the `FFTW` module is defined as `/soft/applications/vasp/aol-libs/3.2/amd-fftw`. We also know that the include path for FFTW is located at `/soft/libraries/aocl/3.2.0/include_LP64/` and the library paths are located at `(FFTW)/lib`.\n\nTo set up the compiler and libraries, we need to add the include path and library paths for FFTW to the compiler flags.\n\nHere's how to do it:\n\n1. Add the include path for FFTW to the `INCS` variable: `INCS += -I$(FFTW)/include`\n2. Add the library paths for FFTW to the `LLIBS` variable: `LLIBS += -L$(FFTW)/lib -lfftw3 -lfftw3_omp -lomp`\n\nBy doing this, we are telling the compiler to include the FFTW headers and link against the FFTW libraries.\n\n##begin_quote##\nINCS       +=  I/usr/include/c++/7/tr1\nINCS       +=  I/usr/include/c++/7\nINCS       +=  I/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/c++/7\nINCS       +=  I/lus/theta-fs0/software/spack/spack-dev/opt/spack/linux-sles15-x86_64/gcc-9.3.0/gcc-10.2.0-r7v3naxd5xgzzaqxoe73jj2ytwuddamr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/10.2.0/include/\nINCS       +=  I$(FFTW)/include\n##end_quote##\n\n<ANSWER>: The purpose of the `FFTW` module is to use the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) from FFTW in setting up the compiler and libraries by adding the include path and library paths for FFTW to the compiler flags."

These directories contain header files that are used by the compiler to generate object code.\n\nSimilarly, `LLIBS` is set to a series of library directories (`-L$(FFTW)/lib`) and libraries (`-lfftw3 -lfftw3_omp -lomp`). These libraries provide additional functionality for the CPU, such as fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) from FFTW.\n\nTo answer the question, I will summarize how `INCS` and `LLIBS` impact the compilation process:\n\n**INCS**: specifies include directories that contain header files used by the compiler to generate object code.\n\n**LLIBS**: specifies library directories and libraries that provide additional functionality for the CPU, such as FFTs from FFTW.\n\nFinal answer:\n<ANSWER>: The `INCS` variable specifies include directories that contain header files used by the compiler to generate object code, while the `LLIBS` variable specifies library directories and libraries that provide additional functionality for the CPU."

It appears that this variable is used to specify the flags and include directories for the C++ compiler.\n\nFrom the context, we can see that `CXX_PARS` is set to `nvc++ --no_warnings -I/.../include/c++/10.2.0/ ...`, which suggests that it's using the NVIDIA CUDA compiler (`nvc++`) with some specific flags and include directories.\n\nThe `-I` flag is used to specify additional include directories, and the paths provided are related to the C++ standard library and the Cray compiler wrapper `ftn`.\n\nTherefore, the role of the `CXX_PARS` variable is to configure the C++ compiler for use with the Cray compiler wrapper `ftn`, allowing it to access additional math libraries and include directories.\n\nFinal answer:\n<ANSWER>: The `CXX_PARS` variable configures the C++ compiler for use with the Cray compiler wrapper `ftn`, specifying flags and include directories for accessing additional math libraries."

Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.  When possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention.\n\nUse XLA compilation on your code.  XLA is the Accelerated Linear Algebra library that is available in tensorFlow and critical in software like JAX.  XLA will compile a tf.Graph object, generated with tf.function or similar, and perform optimizations like operation-fusion.  XLA can give impressive performance boosts with almost no user changes except to set an environment variable TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2.  If your code is complex, or has dynamically sized tensors (tensors where the shape changes every iteration), XLA can be detrimental: the overhead for compiling functions can be large enough to mitigate performance improvements.

In this case, it will be important to have the craype-accel-nvidia80 module loaded both when compiling your application and during runtime to correctly link against a GPU Transport Layer (GTL) MPI library. Otherwise, you'll likely see GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED is requested, but GTL library is not linked errors during runtime.\n- If running on a specific GPU or subset of GPUs is desired, then the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable can be used. For example, if one only wanted an application to access the first two GPUs on a node, then setting CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 could be used.\n\nBinding MPI ranks to GPUs\n\nThe Cray MPI on Polaris does not currently support binding MPI ranks to GPUs. For applications that need this support, this instead can be handled by use of a small helper script that will appropriately set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES for each MPI rank. One example is available here where each MPI rank is similarly bound to a single GPU with round-robin assignment.\n\nA example set_affinity_gpu_polaris.sh script follows where GPUs are assigned round-robin to MPI ranks.\n\n```bash\n\n!/bin/bash -l\n\nnum_gpus=4\n\nneed to assign GPUs in reverse order due to topology\n\nSee Polaris Device Affinity Information:\n\nhttps://www.alcf.anl.gov/support/user-guides/polaris/hardware-overview/machine-overview/index.html",

A summary of available CPU parallel programming models and relevant compiler flags is shown below. Users are encouraged to review the corresponding man pages and documentation.\n\nProgramming Model GNU NVHPC LLVM OpenMP -fopenmp -mp -fopenmp OpenACC -- -acc=multicore --\n\nHigher-level programming models such as Kokkos and Raja may also be used for CPU programming.\n\nGPU Programming Models\n\nA summary of available GPU programming models and relevant compiler flags is shown below for compilers that generate offloadable code.

As such, the craype-accel-nvidia80 module is in the default environment.

It is primarily designed for biochemical molecules like proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids that have a lot of complicated bonded interactions, but since GROMACS is extremely fast at calculating the nonbonded interactions (that usually dominate simulations) many groups are also using it for research on non-biological systems, e.g. polymers.\n\nUsing GROMACS at ALCF\n\nALCF offers assistance with building binaries and compiling instructions for GROMACS.

A Balsam Site runs on a node with access to the job scheduler, where it can submit and monitor jobs. Overall job state is aggregated on the Balsam Server, making job data from all Sites accessible from any individual site (or the user's laptop), via the command-line interface or the Python API. To get information on how to use the command line tool, you can type balsam --help in your shell.\n\nFull documentation for Balsam is available online.\n\nBalsam requires Python 3.7+. To install Balsam on Polaris, first set up a virtual Python environment:\n\nshell\nmodule load conda\nconda activate base\npython -m venv env\nsource env/bin/activate\npip install --upgrade pip\npip install --pre balsam\n\nTo use Balsam, users need an account on the Balsam server.  Users can get an account by contacting the ALCF Help Desk.  Once a user has an account, they can login and make a new site.  A Balsam site is a project space for your workflow. You will be prompted to select what machine (Polaris) you are working on when creating a new site:\n\nshell\nbalsam login\nbalsam site init -n new-site new-site\ncd new-site\nbalsam site start\n\nSee the Balsam documentation for full details.",

CUDA-GDB is an extension to GDB, the GNU Project debugger. The tool provides developers with a mechanism for debugging CUDA applications running on actual hardware. This enables developers to debug applications without the potential variations introduced by simulation and emulation environments.\n\nStep-by-step guide\n\nDebug Compilation\n\nNVCC, the NVIDIA CUDA compiler driver, provides a mechanism for generating the debugging information necessary for CUDA-GDB to work properly. The -g -G option pair must be passed to NVCC when an application is compiled for ease of debugging with CUDA-GDB; for example,\nnvcc -g -G foo.cu -o foo\nUsing this line to compile the CUDA application foo.cu\n* forces -O0 compilation, with the exception of very limited dead-code eliminations and register-spilling optimizations.\n* makes the compiler include debug information in the executable\n\nRunning CUDA-gdb on Polaris compute nodes\n\nStart an interactive job mode on Polaris as follows:\n\n```\n$ qsub -I -l select=1 -l walltime=1:00:00\n\n$ cuda-gdb --version\nNVIDIA (R) CUDA Debugger\n11.4 release\nPortions Copyright (C) 2007-2021 NVIDIA Corporation\nGNU gdb (GDB) 10.1\nCopyright (C) 2020 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nLicense GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html\nThis is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.\nThere is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.\n\n$ cuda-gdb foo\n```\n\nA quick example with a stream benchmark on a Polaris compute node\n\n```\njkwack@polaris-login-02:~> qsub -I -l select=1 -l walltime=1:00:00\nqsub: waiting for job 308834.polaris-pbs-01.hsn.cm.polaris.alcf.anl.gov to start\nqsub: job 308834.polaris-pbs-01.hsn.cm.polaris.alcf.anl.gov ready",

Many tools exist to address this, of which parsl is just one.  On this page, we'll highlight some of the key pieces of information about parsl that are relevant to Polaris.  Parsl is also extensively documented, has a dedicated Slack Channel, and a large community of users and developers beyond ALCF.  We encourage you to engage with the parsl community for support with parsl specific questions, and for Polaris-specific questions or problems, please contact support@alcf.anl.gov.\n\nGetting Parsl on Polaris\n\nYou can install parsl building off of the conda modules.  You have some flexibility in how you want to extend the conda module to include parsl, but here is an example way to do it:\n\n```python\n\nLoad the Conda Module (needed everytime you use parsl)\n\nmodule load conda\nconda activate\n\nCreate a virtual env that uses the conda env as the system packages.\n\nOnly do the next line on initial set up:\n\npython -m venv --system-site-packages /path/to/your/virtualenv\n\nLoad the virtual env (every time):\n\nsource /path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/activate\n\nInstall parsl (only once)\n\npip install parsl\n\n```\n\nUsing Parsl on Polaris\n\nParsl has a variety of possible configuration settings.  As an example, we provide the configuration below that will run one task per GPU:\n\n```python\nfrom parsl.config import Config\n\nPBSPro is the right provider for Polaris:\n\nfrom parsl.providers import PBSProProvider\n\nThe high throughput executor is for scaling to HPC systems:\n\nfrom parsl.executors import HighThroughputExecutor\n\nYou can use the MPI launcher, but may want the Gnu Parallel launcher, see below\n\nfrom parsl.launchers import MpiExecLauncher, GnuParallelLauncher\n\naddress_by_interface is needed for the HighThroughputExecutor:",

One should then see the Makefile lammps-<version>/src/MAKE/MACHINES/Makefile.polaris in recent versions that can be used as a starting point for compilation on Polaris. Copies of Makefiles for building with the GPU/KOKKOS package using CUDA for GPU support with the GNU/NVHPC compiler are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo here. For older versions of LAMMPS, you may need to take an existing Makefile (e.g. Makefile.mpi) for your specific version of LAMMPS and edit the top portion appropratiately to create a new Makefile.polaris.\n\nKOKKOS package and GNU compilers\n\nThe following modules are useful for this particular build. Note, the cmake module is not required if using the GNU Makefile procedure to build LAMMPS. The initial module restore is just setting the default environment as the starting point.

For older versions of LAMMPS, you may need to take an existing Makefile (e.g. Makefile.mpi) for your specific version of LAMMPS and edit the top portion appropratiately to create a new Makefile.polaris.\n\nKOKKOS package and GNU compilers\n\nThe following modules are useful for this particular build. Note, the cmake module is not required if using the GNU Makefile procedure to build LAMMPS. The initial module restore is just setting the default environment as the starting point. Users may find it useful to copy these module commands into a small helper script to assist with compiling and running LAMMPS (e.g. setup_lammps_gnu.sh).",

This consists of running the ParaView client on your local resource, and the ParaView server on the Polaris compute nodes. The ParaView client needs to first be installed on your local resource, and needs to match the version that you run on Polaris.\n\nThere are multiple versions of ParaView installed on Polaris. To find the versions of ParaView currently available on Polaris run the following command on a login node: \nmodule use /soft/modulefiles\nmodule avail paraview\n\nBinary and source packages of the ParaView client for Linux, MacOS, and Windows are available from the ParaView Download Page.\n\nConnecting to the ParaView server on Polaris\n\nThis section describes how to launch the ParaView server on Polaris from a local ParaView client.\n\nStart ParaView Client\n\nFirst, launch the ParaView client on your local resource. You will need to configure some server settings in the client. This initial set up should only need to be done once, and can be reused each time you want to run ParaView on Polaris.\n\nServer Configuration\n\n1. Select Connect\n\nFrom the ParaView client choose to connect to a server by either clicking on the \"Connect\" icon in the menu bar\n\nor selecting File->Connect from the main menu\n\n2. Set Up Servers (first time only)\n\nThe first time you want to run a server on Polaris and have it connect to your local ParaView client, you will need to set up a Server. Once this server is set up, you can reuse it each time you run the ParaView client with the ParaView server on Polaris.\n\nKitware, the developers of ParaView, maintain a database of server configurations which you can retrieve through the ParaView client. In the File->Connect menu press the button named \"Fetch Servers\" and select POLARIS@ANL. Windows users should select \"windows to POLARIS@ANL\". Press \"Import Selected\"\n\n3. Use ParaView",

If your build system does require GPUs, you cannot yet compile on the Polaris login nodes, as they do not currently have GPUs installed. You may in this case compile your applications on the Polaris compute nodes. Do this by submitting an interactive single-node job, or running your build system in a batch job.\n\nHome File System\n\nIs it helpful to realize that there is a single HOME filesystem for users that can be accessed from the login and computes of each production resource at ALCF. Thus, users should be mindful of modifications to their environments (e.g. .bashrc) that may cause issues to arise due to differences between the systems.\n\nCray Programming Environment\n\nThe Cray Programming Environment (PE) uses three compiler wrappers for building software. These compiler wrappers should be used when building MPI-enabled applications.\n\ncc - C compiler\n\nCC - C++ compiler\n\nftn - Fortran compiler\n\nEach of these wrappers can select a specific vendor compiler based on the PrgEnv module loaded in the environment. The following are some helpful options to understand what the compiler wrapper is invoking.\n\n--craype-verbose : Print the command which is forwarded to the compiler invocation\n\n--cray-print-opts=libs : Print library information\n\n--cray-print-opts=cflags : Print include information\n\nThe output from these commands may be useful in build scripts where a compiler other than that invoked by a compiler wrapper is desired. Defining some variables as such may prove useful in those situations.\nCRAY_CFLAGS=$(cc --cray-print-opts=cflags)\nCRAY_LIB=$(cc --cray-print-opts=libs)\nFurther documentation and options are available via man cc and similar.\n\nCompilers provided by Cray Programming Environments",

Identify the context: The given context is related to LAMMPS and NVHPC compilers, specifically mentioning KOKKOS.\n2. Look for relevant information: In the provided Makefile.polaris_nvhpc_kokkos, I find the following lines:\n```\nKOKKOS_DEVICES = Cuda,OpenMP\nKOKKOS_ARCH = Ampere80\n```\nThese lines suggest that KOKKOS is related to CUDA and OpenMP devices, with an architecture of Ampere80.\n\n3. Analyze the context: The provided Makefile.polaris_nvhpc_kokkos is used to build LAMMPS with the KOKKOS package using NVHPC compilers. This implies that KOKKOS is a package or library used in conjunction with LAMMPS and NVHPC.\n\n4. Draw conclusions: Based on the analysis, I conclude that KOKKOS in the context of LAMMPS and NVHPC compilers refers to a package or library used for parallel computing, specifically supporting CUDA and OpenMP devices with an architecture of Ampere80.\n\nFinal answer:\n<ANSWER>: KOKKOS is a package or library used for parallel computing, specifically supporting CUDA and OpenMP devices with an architecture of Ampere80."

If you prefer to use existing containers, you can pull them from various registries like DockerHub and run them on Polaris.\n\nSince Docker requires root privileges, which users do not have on Polaris, existing Docker containers must be converted to Apptainer.

        "cot_answer": "To answer this question, I will provide step-by-step reasoning on how to run LAMMPS application flags and options on a computing system like Polaris.\n\nReasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to create a submission script for running our KOKKOS-enabled LAMMPS executable. We can use the `PBS` command to specify the job requirements.\n2. The first line of the script should be `#!/bin/sh`, which specifies the shell interpreter.\n3. Next, we need to specify the node selection and placement using the `-l select` and `-l place` options respectively. In this case, we want to run our job on 64 nodes (`select=64:system=polaris`) and scatter them across the system (`place=scatter`).\n4. We also need to specify the walltime limit for the job using the `-l walltime` option. In this example, we set it to 15 minutes (`0:15:00`).\n5. Additionally, we can specify the file systems that are required by our job using the `-l filesystems` option.\n6. We need to specify the queue where our job should be executed using the `-q` option. In this case, we choose the `prod` queue.\n7. Finally, we can specify any additional requirements or settings for our job using the `-A` option.\n\nHere is an example submission script that incorporates these steps:\n\n```\n#!/bin/sh\nPBS -l select=64:system=polaris\nPBS -l place=scatter\nPBS -l walltime=0:15:00\nPBS -l filesystems=home:grand:eagle\nPBS -q prod\nPBS -A Catalyst\nexport MPICH_GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED=1\nNNODES=wc -l < $PBS_NODEFILE\nper-node settings\n```\n\nFinal Answer:\n<ANSWER>: The example submission script for running a 64-node KOKKOS-enabled LAMMPS executable on Polaris is shown above."

This guide details the use of containers on Polaris, including custom container creation, large-scale execution, and common pitfalls.\n\nApptainer Setup\n\nPolaris employs Apptainer (formerly known as Singularity) for container management. To set up Apptainer, run:\n\nbash\nmodule use /soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/install/modulefiles/Core\nmodule load apptainer\napptainer version #1.2.2\n\nThe Apptainer version on Polaris is 1.2.2. Detailed user documentation is available here\n\nBuilding from Docker or Argonne GitHub Container Registry\n\nContainers on Polaris can be built by writing Dockerfiles on a local machine and then publish the container to DockerHub, or by directly building them on ALCF compute node by writing an Apptainer recipe file. If you prefer to use existing containers, you can pull them from various registries like DockerHub and run them on Polaris.\n\nSince Docker requires root privileges, which users do not have on Polaris, existing Docker containers must be converted to Apptainer. To build a Docker-based container on Polaris, use the following as an example:",

All\nALCF-managed software is accessible to users via modules.\n\nThe base suite of software tools and libraries can be accessed by loading the\nspack-pe-base module.

If your build system does require GPUs, you cannot yet compile on the Polaris login nodes, as they do not currently have GPUs installed. You may in this case compile your applications on the Polaris compute nodes. Do this by submitting an interactive single-node job, or running your build system in a batch job.\n\nHome File System\n\nIs it helpful to realize that there is a single HOME filesystem for users that can be accessed from the login and computes of each production resource at ALCF. Thus, users should be mindful of modifications to their environments (e.g. .bashrc) that may cause issues to arise due to differences between the systems.\n\nCray Programming Environment\n\nThe Cray Programming Environment (PE) uses three compiler wrappers for building software. These compiler wrappers should be used when building MPI-enabled applications.\n\ncc - C compiler\n\nCC - C++ compiler\n\nftn - Fortran compiler\n\nEach of these wrappers can select a specific vendor compiler based on the PrgEnv module loaded in the environment. The following are some helpful options to understand what the compiler wrapper is invoking.\n\n--craype-verbose : Print the command which is forwarded to the compiler invocation\n\n--cray-print-opts=libs : Print library information\n\n--cray-print-opts=cflags : Print include information\n\nThe output from these commands may be useful in build scripts where a compiler other than that invoked by a compiler wrapper is desired. Defining some variables as such may prove useful in those situations.\nCRAY_CFLAGS=$(cc --cray-print-opts=cflags)\nCRAY_LIB=$(cc --cray-print-opts=libs)\nFurther documentation and options are available via man cc and similar.\n\nCompilers provided by Cray Programming Environments",

Developers can optimize bottlenecks to scale efficiently across any number or size of CPUs and GPUs on Polaris. For further optimizations to compute kernels developers should use Nsight Compute.\n\nThe NVIDIA Nsight Compute is an interactive kernel profiler for CUDA applications. It provides detailed performance metrics and API debugging via a user interface and command line tool.\n\nIn addition, the baseline feature of this tool allows users to compare results within the tool. NVIDIA Nsight Compute provides a customizable and data-driven user interface,  metric collection, and can be extended with analysis scripts for post-processing results.\n\nStep-by-step guide\n\nCommon part on Polaris\n\nBuild your application for Polaris, and then submit your job script to Polaris or start an interactive job mode on Polaris as follows:\n\n```\n$ qsub -I -l select=1 -l walltime=1:00:00 -l filesystems=home:eagle -q debug -A\n\n$ module li\n\nCurrently Loaded Modules:\n  1) nvhpc/23.9          5) cray-pmi/6.1.13      9) PrgEnv-nvhpc/8.5.0      13) darshan/3.4.4\n  2) craype/2.7.30       6) cray-pals/1.3.4     10) libfabric/1.15.2.0\n  3) cray-dsmml/0.2.2    7) cray-libpals/1.3.4  11) craype-network-ofi\n  4) cray-mpich/8.1.28   8) craype-x86-milan    12) perftools-base/23.12.0\n\n$ nsys --version\nNVIDIA Nsight Systems version 2023.3.1.92-233133147223v0\n\n$ ncu --version\nNVIDIA (R) Nsight Compute Command Line Profiler\nCopyright (c) 2018-2023 NVIDIA Corporation\nVersion 2023.2.1.0 (build 33050884) (public-release)\nNVIDIA Nsight Systems version 2022.4.2.1-df9881f\n```\n\nNsight Systems\n\nRun your application with Nsight Systems as follows:\n\n$ nsys profile -o {output_filename} --stats=true ./{your_application}",

                "Compilers provided by Cray Programming Environments\n\nThe default programming environment on Polaris is currently NVHPC. The GNU compilers are available via another programming environment. The following sequence of module commands can be used to switch to the GNU programming environment (gcc, g++, gfortran) and also have NVIDIA compilers available in your path.\n\nmodule swap PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-gnu\nmodule load nvhpc-mixed\n\nThe compilers invoked by the Cray MPI wrappers are listed for each programming environment in the following table.\n\nmodule C C++ Fortran MPI Compiler Wrapper cc CC ftn PrgEnv-nvhpc nvc nvc++ nvfortran PrgEnv-gnu gcc g++ gfortran\n\nNote, while gcc and g++ may be available in the default environment, the PrgEnv-gnu module is needed to provide gfortran.\n\nAdditional Compilers Provided by ALCF\n\nThe ALCF additionally provides compilers to enable the OpenMP and SYCL programming models for GPUs viaLLVM as documented here\n\nAdditional documentation for using compilers is available on the respective programming model pages: OpenMP and SYCL.\n\nLinking\n\nDynamic linking of libraries is currently the default on Polaris. The Cray MPI wrappers will handle this automatically.\n\nNotes on Default Modules\n\ncraype-x86-rome: While the Polaris compute nodes currently have Milan CPUs, this module is loaded by default to avoid the craype-x86-milan module from adding a zen3 target not supported in the default nvhpc/21.9 compilers. The craype-x86-milan module is expected to be made default once a newer nvhpc version (e.g. 22.5) is made the default.\n\ncraype-accel-nvidia80: This module adds compiler flags to enable GPU acceleration for NVHPC compilers along with gpu-enabled MPI libraries as it is assumed that the majority of applications to be compiled on Polaris will target the GPUs for acceleration. Users building cpu-only applications may find it useful to unload this module to silence \"gpu code generation\" warnings.\n\nMixed C/C++ & Fortran Applications",

In this case, it will be important to have the craype-accel-nvidia80 module loaded both when compiling your application and during runtime to correctly link against a GPU Transport Layer (GTL) MPI library. Otherwise, you'll likely see GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED is requested, but GTL library is not linked errors during runtime.\n- If running on a specific GPU or subset of GPUs is desired, then the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable can be used. For example, if one only wanted an application to access the first two GPUs on a node, then setting CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 could be used.\n\nBinding MPI ranks to GPUs\n\nThe Cray MPI on Polaris does not currently support binding MPI ranks to GPUs. For applications that need this support, this instead can be handled by use of a small helper script that will appropriately set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES for each MPI rank. One example is available here where each MPI rank is similarly bound to a single GPU with round-robin assignment.\n\nA example set_affinity_gpu_polaris.sh script follows where GPUs are assigned round-robin to MPI ranks.\n\n```bash\n\n!/bin/bash -l\n\nnum_gpus=4\n\nneed to assign GPUs in reverse order due to topology\n\nSee Polaris Device Affinity Information:\n\nhttps://www.alcf.anl.gov/support/user-guides/polaris/hardware-overview/machine-overview/index.html",

Existing binaries are unlikely to run successfully.\n\nWe have held all jobs submitted prior to the upgrade as a user hold. Users may release their existing jobs with qrls to run after they have rebuilt their binaries.\n\nPBS does cache the job execution script.  If a change to the script is required due to a path changing post rebuild, the job will have to be resubmitted.\n\nAll application binaries should be rebuilt prior to further job submissions.\n\nRe-building user codes\n\nMany user codes will need to be re-built and/or re-linked against the newer version of the programming environment (23.12) and Spack provided dependencies.\n\nChanges to the user software environment\n\nIn addition to the system upgrades, several changes have been made to the user\nsoftware environment which may impact user workflows.\n\nOlder PE versions removed\n\nOlder versions of the Cray PE (older than 23.12) are deprecated as they are incompatible with the\nupgraded system stack and are no longer available for use.\n\nDatascience Anaconda Module Updates",

                "Compiling and Linking Overview on Polaris\n\nCompiling on Polaris Login and Compute Nodes\n\nIf your build system does not require GPUs for the build process, as is usually the case, compilation of GPU-accelerated codes is generally expected to work well on the Polaris login nodes. If your build system does require GPUs, you cannot yet compile on the Polaris login nodes, as they do not currently have GPUs installed. You may in this case compile your applications on the Polaris compute nodes. Do this by submitting an interactive single-node job, or running your build system in a batch job.\n\nHome File System\n\nIs it helpful to realize that there is a single HOME filesystem for users that can be accessed from the login and computes of each production resource at ALCF. Thus, users should be mindful of modifications to their environments (e.g. .bashrc) that may cause issues to arise due to differences between the systems.\n\nCray Programming Environment\n\nThe Cray Programming Environment (PE) uses three compiler wrappers for building software. These compiler wrappers should be used when building MPI-enabled applications.\n\ncc - C compiler\n\nCC - C++ compiler\n\nftn - Fortran compiler\n\nEach of these wrappers can select a specific vendor compiler based on the PrgEnv module loaded in the environment. The following are some helpful options to understand what the compiler wrapper is invoking.\n\n--craype-verbose : Print the command which is forwarded to the compiler invocation\n\n--cray-print-opts=libs : Print library information\n\n--cray-print-opts=cflags : Print include information\n\nThe output from these commands may be useful in build scripts where a compiler other than that invoked by a compiler wrapper is desired. Defining some variables as such may prove useful in those situations.\nCRAY_CFLAGS=$(cc --cray-print-opts=cflags)\nCRAY_LIB=$(cc --cray-print-opts=libs)\nFurther documentation and options are available via man cc and similar.\n\nCompilers provided by Cray Programming Environments",

                "Running Multiple MPI Applications on a node\n\nMultiple applications can be run simultaneously on a node by launching several mpiexec commands and backgrounding them. For performance, it will likely be necessary to ensure that each application runs on a distinct set of CPU resources and/or targets specific GPUs. One can provide a list of CPUs using the --cpu-bind option, which when combined with CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES provides a user with specifying exactly which CPU and GPU resources to run each application on. In the example below, four instances of the application are simultaneously running on a single node. In the first instance, the application is spawning MPI ranks 0-7 on CPUs 24-31 and using GPU 0. This mapping is based on output from the nvidia-smi topo -m command and pairs CPUs with the closest GPU.\n\n```bash\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:24:25:26:27:28:29:30:31 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:16:17:18:19:20:21:22:23 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:8:9:10:11:12:13:14:15 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=3\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:0:1:2:3:4:5:6:7 ./hello_affinity &\n\nwait\n```\n\nCompute Node Access to the Internet\n\nCurrently, the only access the internet is via a proxy.  Here are the proxy environment variables for Polaris:\n\nbash\nexport http_proxy=\"http://proxy.alcf.anl.gov:3128\"\nexport https_proxy=\"http://proxy.alcf.anl.gov:3128\"\nexport ftp_proxy=\"http://proxy.alcf.anl.gov:3128\"\n\nIn the future, though we don't have a timeline on this because it depends on future features in slingshot and internal software development, we intend to have public IP addresses be a schedulable resource.  For instance, if only your head node needed public access your select statement might looks something like: -l select=1:pubnet=True+63.\n\nControlling Where Your Job Runs",

                "ParaView on Polaris\n\nThe recommended way of running ParaView on Polaris is in client/server mode. This consists of running the ParaView client on your local resource, and the ParaView server on the Polaris compute nodes. The ParaView client needs to first be installed on your local resource, and needs to match the version that you run on Polaris.\n\nThere are multiple versions of ParaView installed on Polaris. To find the versions of ParaView currently available on Polaris run the following command on a login node: \nmodule use /soft/modulefiles\nmodule avail paraview\n\nBinary and source packages of the ParaView client for Linux, MacOS, and Windows are available from the ParaView Download Page.\n\nConnecting to the ParaView server on Polaris\n\nThis section describes how to launch the ParaView server on Polaris from a local ParaView client.\n\nStart ParaView Client\n\nFirst, launch the ParaView client on your local resource. You will need to configure some server settings in the client. This initial set up should only need to be done once, and can be reused each time you want to run ParaView on Polaris.\n\nServer Configuration\n\n1. Select Connect\n\nFrom the ParaView client choose to connect to a server by either clicking on the \"Connect\" icon in the menu bar\n\nor selecting File->Connect from the main menu\n\n2. Set Up Servers (first time only)\n\nThe first time you want to run a server on Polaris and have it connect to your local ParaView client, you will need to set up a Server. Once this server is set up, you can reuse it each time you run the ParaView client with the ParaView server on Polaris.\n\nKitware, the developers of ParaView, maintain a database of server configurations which you can retrieve through the ParaView client. In the File->Connect menu press the button named \"Fetch Servers\" and select POLARIS@ANL. Windows users should select \"windows to POLARIS@ANL\". Press \"Import Selected\"\n\n3. Use ParaView",

The version you download must match the server version installed on Polaris. Use this page\n\nDownload the Polaris host profile for VisIt (you may need to right-click and choose \"Save link as...\" or \"Save target as...\")\n\nCopy this file to a file called ~/.visit/hosts/host_anl_polaris.xml on Mac or Linux. [ We need to also specify this path for for Windows]\n\nNote: VisIt allows the user to download host profiles for ANL, but all these settings are outdated. We are working with the VisIt developers to update the ANL host list.\n\nAdditional information for using VisIt in client/server mode here\n\nRunning VisIt\n\nStart up VisIt on your local machine\n\nClick File -> Open File and choose \"ANL Polaris\" from the \"Host\" dropdown\n\nYou'll be prompted for your password; enter your ALCF authenticator app response\n\nWhen you open a selected file, it will launch a job on Polaris\nYou will need to specify the \"Bank\" (Project) to use when VisIt submits jobs to the queue on Polaris.

For this reason, it is recommended to use start_method=\"spawn\" on Polaris when using the MpiExecLauncher as is shown in the example config above.  Alternatively, another solution is to use the GNUParallelLauncher which uses GNU Parallel to spawn processes.  GNU Parallel can be loaded in your environment with the command module load gnu-parallel.  Both of these approaches will circumvent the hang issue from using fork.\n\nUpdates\n\nFor parsl versions after July 2023, the address passed in the HighThroughputExecutor needs to be set to address = address_by_interface(\"bond0\").  With parsl versions prior to July 2023, it was recommended to use address = address_by_hostname() on Polaris, but with later versions this will not work on Polaris (or any other machine).",

The -g -G option pair must be passed to NVCC when an application is compiled for ease of debugging with CUDA-GDB; for example,\nnvcc -g -G foo.cu -o foo\nUsing this line to compile the CUDA application foo.cu\n* forces -O0 compilation, with the exception of very limited dead-code eliminations and register-spilling optimizations.\n* makes the compiler include debug information in the executable\n\nRunning CUDA-gdb on Polaris compute nodes\n\nStart an interactive job mode on Polaris as follows:\n\n```\n$ qsub -I -l select=1 -l walltime=1:00:00\n\n$ cuda-gdb --version\nNVIDIA (R) CUDA Debugger\n11.4 release\nPortions Copyright (C) 2007-2021 NVIDIA Corporation\nGNU gdb (GDB) 10.1\nCopyright (C) 2020 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nLicense GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html\nThis is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.\nThere is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.\n\n$ cuda-gdb foo\n```\n\nA quick example with a stream benchmark on a Polaris compute node\n\n```\njkwack@polaris-login-02:~> qsub -I -l select=1 -l walltime=1:00:00\nqsub: waiting for job 308834.polaris-pbs-01.hsn.cm.polaris.alcf.anl.gov to start\nqsub: job 308834.polaris-pbs-01.hsn.cm.polaris.alcf.anl.gov ready",

JAX is built on XLA (the same XLA TensorFlow uses) as well as AutoGrad, and additionally has acceleration tools that operate on functions such as vmap, jit, etc.  JAX is not as widespread in machine learning as TensorFlow and PyTorch for traditional models (Computer Vision, Language Models) though it is quickly gaining promienence.  JAX is very powerful when a program needs non-traditional autodifferentiation or vectorizatoin, such as: forward-mode AD, higher order derivatives, Jacobians, Hessians, or any combination of the above.  Users of JAX on Polaris are encouraged to read the user documentation in detail, particularly the details about pure-functional programming, no in-place operations, and the common mistakes in writing functions for the @jit decorator.\n\nJAX on Polaris\n\nJAX is installed on Polaris via the conda module, available with:\nbash\nmodule load conda; conda activate\n\nThen, you can load JAX in python as usual (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):\n\n```python\n\nimport jax\njax.version\n'0.3.15'\n\n```\n\nNotes on JAX 0.3.15\n\nOn Polaris, due to a bug, an environment variable must be set to use JAX on GPUs.

This guide details the use of containers on Polaris, including custom container creation, large-scale execution, and common pitfalls.\n\nApptainer Setup\n\nPolaris employs Apptainer (formerly known as Singularity) for container management. To set up Apptainer, run:\n\nbash\nmodule use /soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/install/modulefiles/Core\nmodule load apptainer\napptainer version #1.2.2\n\nThe Apptainer version on Polaris is 1.2.2. Detailed user documentation is available here\n\nBuilding from Docker or Argonne GitHub Container Registry\n\nContainers on Polaris can be built by writing Dockerfiles on a local machine and then publish the container to DockerHub, or by directly building them on ALCF compute node by writing an Apptainer recipe file. If you prefer to use existing containers, you can pull them from various registries like DockerHub and run them on Polaris.\n\nSince Docker requires root privileges, which users do not have on Polaris, existing Docker containers must be converted to Apptainer.

The kernel is executing on the GPU and has hit a breakpoint at line 203 of the file `CUDAStream.cu`.\n\n##begin_quote##\nThread 1 \"cuda-stream-deb\" hit Breakpoint 1, triad_kernel\n<<<(32768,1,1),(10,24,1,1)>>> (a=0x15550e00000, b=0x15f4f60000, c=0x15f4e60000)\n    at ../src/cuda/CUDAStream.cu:203\n203   a[i] = b[i] + scalar * c[i];\n##end_quote##\n\n**Step 2: Examine the local variables**\nWe can use the `info locals` command to examine the local variables in the kernel.

We can also use the `Function`, `MBytes/sec`, `Min (sec)`, `Max`, and `Average` commands to analyze the performance metrics of the kernel.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n<ANSWER>: The debugger works in CUDA by allowing us to set breakpoints, examine local variables, evaluate expressions, continue execution, and analyze performance metrics."

The specification describes directives, runtime routines, and environment variables that allow an application developer to express parallelism (e.g. shared memory multiprocessing and device offloading). Many compiler vendors provide implementations of the OpenMP specification (https://www.openmp.org/specifications).\n\nSetting the environment to use OpenMP on Polaris\n\nMany of the programming environments available on Polaris have OpenMP support.\n\nmodule OpenMP CPU support? OpenMP GPU support? PrgEnv-nvhpc yes yes llvm yes yes PrgEnv-gnu yes no PrgEnv-cray yes yes*\n\nCurrently PrgEnv-cray is not recommended for OpenMP offload.\n\nBy default, the PrgEnv-nvhpc module is loaded. To switch to other modules, you can use module switch.\n\nUsing PrgEnv-nvhpc\n\nThis is loaded by default, so there's no need to load additional modules. You can confirm that it is loaded by running module list to check that PrgEnv-nvhpc is in the list.\n\nUsing LLVM\n\nTo use the LLVM module, load the following.\nmodule load mpiwrappers/cray-mpich-llvm\nmodule load cudatoolkit-standalone\n\nSee the the LLVM compiling page here for more information.\n\nUsing PrgEnv-gnu\n\nTo switch from PrgEnv-nvhpc to PrgEnv-gnu you can run:\n\nmodule switch PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-gnu\n\nThe gcc/gfortran on Polaris was not built with GPU support.

Identify the purpose of the scalar variable in CUDA.\n\n##begin_quote##\nThread 1 \"cuda-stream-deb\" hit Breakpoint 1, triad_kernel<<<(32768,1,1),(10,24,1,1)>>> (a=0x15550,60000,000, b=0x15,54f6,00000, c=0x15,54e6,00000)\n    at ../src/cuda/CUDAStream.cu:203\n203   a[i] = b[i] + scalar * c[i];\n##end_quote##\n\nFrom the code snippet above, we can see that the scalar variable is used in the calculation `a[i] = b[i] + scalar * c[i];`. This suggests that the purpose of the scalar variable is to scale the values of `c[i]` before adding them to `b[i]`.\n\n2. Analyze the context to determine how the scalar variable affects the computation.\n\nThe code snippet shows that the value of `scalar` is 0.40000... (copied from the output of `p scalar`). This suggests that the scalar variable has a significant impact on the computation, as it multiplies the values of `c[i]`.\n\n3. Summarize the purpose of the scalar variable in CUDA.\n\nBased on the analysis above, I conclude that the purpose of the scalar variable in CUDA is to scale the values of an array before performing arithmetic operations with other arrays.\n\n<ANSWER>: The purpose of the scalar variable in CUDA is to scale the values of an array."

This submits the script to one node in the debug queue on Polaris, requesting 30 min and the eagle and home filesystems. It will charge project Catalyst for the time.\n\nMore details for setting up the job script are in Job Scheduling and Execution section.\n\nExample\n\n```\n$ cat hello.cpp\n\ninclude\n\ninclude\n\nint main( int argv, char** argc ) {\n\nprintf( \"Number of devices: %d\\n\", omp_get_num_devices() );",

In this section we will explain an alternative method to run the ParaView server on Polaris using an interactive job, where the user can launch the ParaView server from the command line interface.\n\nNote: this is a method better suited for experienced users. If you are just starting with ParaView, we recommend the client/server mode as your primary method for using this tool.\n\nSetting up ParaView\n\nFrom your local client select Connect, either from the File menu, or by clicking on the icon circled below:\n\nA new window will open where you can configure a server. Click on Add Server:\n\nGive your server a name, select Client/Server, localhost, and a TCP port (8000 in this example)\n\nClick \"Configure\". In the next window there is an option to set up how ParaView server will be launched, and the default is \"Manual\". Leave it on \"Manual\" and click \"Save\".\n\nYou will use these settings when establishing the connection.\n\nLaunching the ParaView server on Polaris\n\nYou can launch an interactive session on Polaris compute nodes with the following command (adjust parameters as needed to match your allocation, desired number of nodes, queue, walltime, and filesystems):\n\nshell\nqsub -l walltime=01:00:00 -l select=2 -A yourallocation -q debug -I -l filesystems=home:grand\n\nWhen the job starts you will receive a prompt on your head node like this:\n\nusername@x3005c0s7b0n0:~>\n\nMake a note of the node hostname (x3005c0s7b0n0 in the example above). You can also get this information from qstat -fx jobID\n\nNow load the ParaView module\n\nusername@x3005c0s7b0n0:~> module use /soft/modulefiles \nusername@x3005c0s7b0n0:~> module load visualization/paraview/paraview-5.12.0-EGL\n\nand launch the ParaView server with",

To set up Apptainer, run:\n\nbash\nmodule use /soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/install/modulefiles/Core\nmodule load apptainer\napptainer version #1.2.2\n\nThe Apptainer version on Polaris is 1.2.2. Detailed user documentation is available here\n\nBuilding from Docker or Argonne GitHub Container Registry\n\nContainers on Polaris can be built by writing Dockerfiles on a local machine and then publish the container to DockerHub, or by directly building them on ALCF compute node by writing an Apptainer recipe file. If you prefer to use existing containers, you can pull them from various registries like DockerHub and run them on Polaris.\n\nSince Docker requires root privileges, which users do not have on Polaris, existing Docker containers must be converted to Apptainer.

Many tools exist to address this, of which parsl is just one.  On this page, we'll highlight some of the key pieces of information about parsl that are relevant to Polaris.  Parsl is also extensively documented, has a dedicated Slack Channel, and a large community of users and developers beyond ALCF.  We encourage you to engage with the parsl community for support with parsl specific questions, and for Polaris-specific questions or problems, please contact support@alcf.anl.gov.\n\nGetting Parsl on Polaris\n\nYou can install parsl building off of the conda modules.  You have some flexibility in how you want to extend the conda module to include parsl, but here is an example way to do it:\n\n```python\n\nLoad the Conda Module (needed everytime you use parsl)\n\nmodule load conda\nconda activate\n\nCreate a virtual env that uses the conda env as the system packages.\n\nOnly do the next line on initial set up:\n\npython -m venv --system-site-packages /path/to/your/virtualenv\n\nLoad the virtual env (every time):\n\nsource /path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/activate\n\nInstall parsl (only once)\n\npip install parsl\n\n```\n\nUsing Parsl on Polaris\n\nParsl has a variety of possible configuration settings.  As an example, we provide the configuration below that will run one task per GPU:\n\n```python\nfrom parsl.config import Config\n\nPBSPro is the right provider for Polaris:\n\nfrom parsl.providers import PBSProProvider\n\nThe high throughput executor is for scaling to HPC systems:\n\nfrom parsl.executors import HighThroughputExecutor\n\nYou can use the MPI launcher, but may want the Gnu Parallel launcher, see below\n\nfrom parsl.launchers import MpiExecLauncher, GnuParallelLauncher\n\naddress_by_interface is needed for the HighThroughputExecutor:",

                "Use TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.  Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.  When possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention.\n\nUse XLA compilation on your code.  XLA is the Accelerated Linear Algebra library that is available in tensorFlow and critical in software like JAX.  XLA will compile a tf.Graph object, generated with tf.function or similar, and perform optimizations like operation-fusion.  XLA can give impressive performance boosts with almost no user changes except to set an environment variable TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2.  If your code is complex, or has dynamically sized tensors (tensors where the shape changes every iteration), XLA can be detrimental: the overhead for compiling functions can be large enough to mitigate performance improvements.  XLA is particularly powerful when combined with reduced precision, yielding speedups > 100% in some models.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nTensorFlow is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with tensorFlow has been seen with horovod in particular.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation.  Some polaris specific details that may be helpful to you:\n\nCPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.  In particular, we encourage users to try their scaling measurements with the following settings:\n\nSet the environment variable NCCL_COLLNET_ENABLE=1",

It allows you to construct visualization pipelines for quick data analysis. Whether interactively exploring large datasets in 3D or performing batch processing programmatically, ParaView provides versatile capabilities. For additional information, visit the Kitware website.\n\nVisIt: VisIt is an open-source, interactive, and scalable visualization, animation, and analysis tool. Users can rapidly generate visualizations, animate them over time, apply various operators and mathematical expressions, and save resulting images and animations for presentations. VisIt supports a diverse range of visualization features, enabling users to view data, including scalar and vector fields, on 2D and 3D structured, adaptive, and unstructured meshes. Thanks to its customizable plugin design, VisIt can visualize data from over 120 different scientific data formats. For more information, check the VisIt project GitHub page.\n\nFFmpeg: FFmpeg is a complete solution to record, convert, and stream audio and video. For more information, visit the FFmpeg webpage\n\nImageMagick: ImageMagick is a free, open-source software suite, used for editing and manipulating digital images. It can be used to create, edit, compose, or convert bitmap images, and supports a wide range of file formats, including JPEG, PNG, GIF, TIFF, and PDF. More information in the ImageMagick webpage.",

Note that if you import mpi4py or horovod, and then do something like os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = hvd.local_rank(), it may not actually work!  You must set the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable prior to doing MPI.COMM_WORLD.init(), which is done in horovod.init() as well as implicitly in from mpi4py import MPI.   On Polaris specifically, you can use the environment variable PMI_LOCAL_RANK (as well as PMI_LOCAL_SIZE) to learn information about the node-local MPI ranks.\n\nDeepSpeed\n\nDeepSpeed is also available and usable on Polaris.  For more information, please see the DeepSpeed documentation directly.\n\nPyTorch DataLoader and multi-node Horovod\n\nPlease note there is a bug that causes a hang when using PyTorch's multithreaded data loaders with distributed training across multiple nodes. To workaround this, NVIDIA recommends setting num_workers=0 in the dataloader configuration, which serializes data loading.\n\nFor more details, see Polaris Known Issues.",

It has a syntax familiar to users of many other\ntechnical computing environments. Designed at MIT to tackle large-scale\npartial-differential equation simulation and distributed linear algebra, Julia\nfeatures a robust ecosystem of tools for\noptimization,\nstatistics, parallel programming, and data\nvisualization. Julia is actively developed by the Julia\nLabs team at MIT and in\nindustry, along with hundreds of domain-expert\nscientists and programmers worldwide.\n\nContributing\n\nThis guide is a first draft of the Julia documentation for Polaris. If you have any\nsuggestions or contributions, please open a pull request or contact us by\nopening a ticket at the ALCF Helpdesk.\n\nJulia Installation\n\nWe encourage users interested in using Julia on Polaris to install in their home or project directories at this time. Using the official Julia 1.9 binaries from the Julia\nwebpage is recommended.\nJuliaup provides a convenient way to\ninstall Julia and manage the various Julia versions. The default installation will install julia, juliaup, and other commands in a ${HOME}/.julia directory and update profile files like .bashrc to update PATH to include that directory. One can customize the installation to change these defaults.\n\nbash\nmodule load craype-accel-nvidia80\ncurl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh\n\nIf you chose a custom installation, then be sure to update the PATH environment variable appropriately.\n\nexport PATH=${HOME}/.juliaup/bin:${PATH}\n\nYou may then list the available Julia versions with juliaup list and install a\nspecific version with juliaup install <version>. You can then activate a\nspecific version with juliaup use <version> and set the default version with\njuliaup default <version>. juliaup update will update the installed Julia\nversions.

Existing binaries are unlikely to run successfully.\n\nWe have held all jobs submitted prior to the upgrade as a user hold. Users may release their existing jobs with qrls to run after they have rebuilt their binaries.\n\nPBS does cache the job execution script.  If a change to the script is required due to a path changing post rebuild, the job will have to be resubmitted.\n\nAll application binaries should be rebuilt prior to further job submissions.\n\nRe-building user codes\n\nMany user codes will need to be re-built and/or re-linked against the newer version of the programming environment (23.12) and Spack provided dependencies.\n\nChanges to the user software environment\n\nIn addition to the system upgrades, several changes have been made to the user\nsoftware environment which may impact user workflows.\n\nOlder PE versions removed\n\nOlder versions of the Cray PE (older than 23.12) are deprecated as they are incompatible with the\nupgraded system stack and are no longer available for use.\n\nDatascience Anaconda Module Updates",

                "Spack PE\n\nSpack is an HPC-oriented package manager which ALCF uses to install software for\nthe user environment.\n\nALCF's Spack PE is a Spack-managed software stack which provides various build\ntools, utilities, and libraries. It consists of a base stack (spack-pe-base)\nand PrgEnv-dependent stacks (currently spack-pe-gnu).\n\nspack-pe-base contains commonplace software compiled for CPU with the system\nGCC compilers. Accordingly, the software in spack-pe-base can be used\nregardless of programming environment.\n\nspack-pe-gnu is based on the E4S Project and\nprovides performant HPC libraries built with PrgEnv-gnu and the nvcc CUDA\ncompiler driver for GPU code. spack-pe-gnu is dependent on both\nspack-pe-base and PrgEnv-gnu.\n\nUsing software from the Spack PE\n\nThe base suite of software tools and libraries can be accessed by loading the\nspack-pe-base module. This adds a path to $MODULEPATH which contains\nnumerous modules.\n\nFor example, to load cmake starting from the default environment, a user\nshould run the following commands:\nmodule use /soft/modulefiles\nmodule load spack-pe-base\nmodule load cmake\n\nThe spack-pe-base module adds paths to the user's MODULEPATH; individual packages are subsequently loaded through the newly available modules. The full list of available packages can be viewed by running module avail or module --show-hidden avail for a complete listing. Packages are loaded in the same way from spack-pe-gnu.\n\nInspecting packages\n\nWhen a module in the Spack PE is loaded, several environment variables are\nupdated to integrate the package into the user's environment. Additionally, the\nPACKAGE_ROOT variable is set to the path to the installation prefix of the\npackage. For example, after loading cmake as above:\n\n$ echo $CMAKE_ROOT\n/soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/install/linux-sles15-x86_64/gcc-12.3.0/cmake-3.27.7-a435jtzvweeos2es6enirbxdjdqhqgdp/\n$ ls -a $CMAKE_ROOT\n.  ..  bin  doc  share  .spack",

It provides a combination of flexibility (through custom forces and integrators), openness, and high-performance (especially on recent GPUs).\n\nUsing OpenMM at ALCF\n\nALCF offers assistance with building binaries and compiling instructions for OpenMM.

In this case, it will be important to have the craype-accel-nvidia80 module loaded both when compiling your application and during runtime to correctly link against a GPU Transport Layer (GTL) MPI library. Otherwise, you'll likely see GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED is requested, but GTL library is not linked errors during runtime.\n- If running on a specific GPU or subset of GPUs is desired, then the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable can be used. For example, if one only wanted an application to access the first two GPUs on a node, then setting CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 could be used.\n\nBinding MPI ranks to GPUs\n\nThe Cray MPI on Polaris does not currently support binding MPI ranks to GPUs. For applications that need this support, this instead can be handled by use of a small helper script that will appropriately set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES for each MPI rank. One example is available here where each MPI rank is similarly bound to a single GPU with round-robin assignment.\n\nA example set_affinity_gpu_polaris.sh script follows where GPUs are assigned round-robin to MPI ranks.\n\n```bash\n\n!/bin/bash -l\n\nnum_gpus=4\n\nneed to assign GPUs in reverse order due to topology\n\nSee Polaris Device Affinity Information:\n\nhttps://www.alcf.anl.gov/support/user-guides/polaris/hardware-overview/machine-overview/index.html",

JAX is built on XLA (the same XLA TensorFlow uses) as well as AutoGrad, and additionally has acceleration tools that operate on functions such as vmap, jit, etc.  JAX is not as widespread in machine learning as TensorFlow and PyTorch for traditional models (Computer Vision, Language Models) though it is quickly gaining promienence.  JAX is very powerful when a program needs non-traditional autodifferentiation or vectorizatoin, such as: forward-mode AD, higher order derivatives, Jacobians, Hessians, or any combination of the above.  Users of JAX on Polaris are encouraged to read the user documentation in detail, particularly the details about pure-functional programming, no in-place operations, and the common mistakes in writing functions for the @jit decorator.\n\nJAX on Polaris\n\nJAX is installed on Polaris via the conda module, available with:\nbash\nmodule load conda; conda activate\n\nThen, you can load JAX in python as usual (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):\n\n```python\n\nimport jax\njax.version\n'0.3.15'\n\n```\n\nNotes on JAX 0.3.15\n\nOn Polaris, due to a bug, an environment variable must be set to use JAX on GPUs.

                "Running Multiple MPI Applications on a node\n\nMultiple applications can be run simultaneously on a node by launching several mpiexec commands and backgrounding them. For performance, it will likely be necessary to ensure that each application runs on a distinct set of CPU resources and/or targets specific GPUs. One can provide a list of CPUs using the --cpu-bind option, which when combined with CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES provides a user with specifying exactly which CPU and GPU resources to run each application on. In the example below, four instances of the application are simultaneously running on a single node. In the first instance, the application is spawning MPI ranks 0-7 on CPUs 24-31 and using GPU 0. This mapping is based on output from the nvidia-smi topo -m command and pairs CPUs with the closest GPU.\n\n```bash\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:24:25:26:27:28:29:30:31 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:16:17:18:19:20:21:22:23 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:8:9:10:11:12:13:14:15 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=3\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:0:1:2:3:4:5:6:7 ./hello_affinity &\n\nwait\n```\n\nCompute Node Access to the Internet\n\nCurrently, the only access the internet is via a proxy.  Here are the proxy environment variables for Polaris:\n\nbash\nexport http_proxy=\"http://proxy.alcf.anl.gov:3128\"\nexport https_proxy=\"http://proxy.alcf.anl.gov:3128\"\nexport ftp_proxy=\"http://proxy.alcf.anl.gov:3128\"\n\nIn the future, though we don't have a timeline on this because it depends on future features in slingshot and internal software development, we intend to have public IP addresses be a schedulable resource.

                "Manually launching a ParaView server on Polaris\n\nSometimes it is convenient to manually launch an instance of the ParaView server. In this section we will explain an alternative method to run the ParaView server on Polaris using an interactive job, where the user can launch the ParaView server from the command line interface.\n\nNote: this is a method better suited for experienced users. If you are just starting with ParaView, we recommend the client/server mode as your primary method for using this tool.\n\nSetting up ParaView\n\nFrom your local client select Connect, either from the File menu, or by clicking on the icon circled below:\n\nA new window will open where you can configure a server. Click on Add Server:\n\nGive your server a name, select Client/Server, localhost, and a TCP port (8000 in this example)\n\nClick \"Configure\". In the next window there is an option to set up how ParaView server will be launched, and the default is \"Manual\". Leave it on \"Manual\" and click \"Save\".\n\nYou will use these settings when establishing the connection.\n\nLaunching the ParaView server on Polaris\n\nYou can launch an interactive session on Polaris compute nodes with the following command (adjust parameters as needed to match your allocation, desired number of nodes, queue, walltime, and filesystems):\n\nshell\nqsub -l walltime=01:00:00 -l select=2 -A yourallocation -q debug -I -l filesystems=home:grand\n\nWhen the job starts you will receive a prompt on your head node like this:\n\nusername@x3005c0s7b0n0:~>\n\nMake a note of the node hostname (x3005c0s7b0n0 in the example above). You can also get this information from qstat -fx jobID\n\nNow load the ParaView module\n\nusername@x3005c0s7b0n0:~> module use /soft/modulefiles \nusername@x3005c0s7b0n0:~> module load visualization/paraview/paraview-5.12.0-EGL\n\nand launch the ParaView server with",

For this reason, it is recommended to use start_method=\"spawn\" on Polaris when using the MpiExecLauncher as is shown in the example config above.  Alternatively, another solution is to use the GNUParallelLauncher which uses GNU Parallel to spawn processes.  GNU Parallel can be loaded in your environment with the command module load gnu-parallel.  Both of these approaches will circumvent the hang issue from using fork.\n\nUpdates\n\nFor parsl versions after July 2023, the address passed in the HighThroughputExecutor needs to be set to address = address_by_interface(\"bond0\").

JAX is built on XLA (the same XLA TensorFlow uses) as well as AutoGrad, and additionally has acceleration tools that operate on functions such as vmap, jit, etc.  JAX is not as widespread in machine learning as TensorFlow and PyTorch for traditional models (Computer Vision, Language Models) though it is quickly gaining promienence.  JAX is very powerful when a program needs non-traditional autodifferentiation or vectorizatoin, such as: forward-mode AD, higher order derivatives, Jacobians, Hessians, or any combination of the above.  Users of JAX on Polaris are encouraged to read the user documentation in detail, particularly the details about pure-functional programming, no in-place operations, and the common mistakes in writing functions for the @jit decorator.\n\nJAX on Polaris\n\nJAX is installed on Polaris via the conda module, available with:\nbash\nmodule load conda; conda activate\n\nThen, you can load JAX in python as usual (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):\n\n```python\n\nimport jax\njax.version\n'0.3.15'\n\n```\n\nNotes on JAX 0.3.15\n\nOn Polaris, due to a bug, an environment variable must be set to use JAX on GPUs.

In general, the way to do this is via the PyTorch Automatic Mixed Precision package (AMP), as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  In PyTorch, users generally need to manage casting and loss scaling manually,  though context managers and function decorators can provide easy tools to do this.\n\nPyTorch has a JIT module as well as backends to support op fusion, similar to TensorFlow's tf.function tools.  However, PyTorch JIT capabilities are newer and may not yield performance improvements.  Please see TorchScript for more information.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nPyTorch is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with PyTorch has been seen with both DDP and Horovod.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation or the Distributed Data Parallel documentation.  Some Polaris-specific details that may be helpful to you:\n\nCPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.  In particular, we encourage users to try their scaling measurements with the following settings:\n\nSet the environment variable NCCL_COLLNET_ENABLE=1\n\nSet the environment varialbe NCCL_NET_GDR_LEVEL=PHB\n\nManually set the CPU affinity via mpiexec, such as with --cpu-bind verbose,list:0,8,16,24",

                "Running Multiple MPI Applications on a node\n\nMultiple applications can be run simultaneously on a node by launching several mpiexec commands and backgrounding them. For performance, it will likely be necessary to ensure that each application runs on a distinct set of CPU resources and/or targets specific GPUs. One can provide a list of CPUs using the --cpu-bind option, which when combined with CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES provides a user with specifying exactly which CPU and GPU resources to run each application on. In the example below, four instances of the application are simultaneously running on a single node. In the first instance, the application is spawning MPI ranks 0-7 on CPUs 24-31 and using GPU 0. This mapping is based on output from the nvidia-smi topo -m command and pairs CPUs with the closest GPU.\n\n```bash\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:24:25:26:27:28:29:30:31 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:16:17:18:19:20:21:22:23 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:8:9:10:11:12:13:14:15 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=3\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:0:1:2:3:4:5:6:7 ./hello_affinity &\n\nwait\n```\n\nCompute Node Access to the Internet\n\nCurrently, the only access the internet is via a proxy.  Here are the proxy environment variables for Polaris:\n\nbash\nexport http_proxy=\"http://proxy.alcf.anl.gov:3128\"\nexport https_proxy=\"http://proxy.alcf.anl.gov:3128\"\nexport ftp_proxy=\"http://proxy.alcf.anl.gov:3128\"\n\nIn the future, though we don't have a timeline on this because it depends on future features in slingshot and internal software development, we intend to have public IP addresses be a schedulable resource.

                "Spack PE\n\nSpack is an HPC-oriented package manager which ALCF uses to install software for\nthe user environment.\n\nALCF's Spack PE is a Spack-managed software stack which provides various build\ntools, utilities, and libraries. It consists of a base stack (spack-pe-base)\nand PrgEnv-dependent stacks (currently spack-pe-gnu).\n\nspack-pe-base contains commonplace software compiled for CPU with the system\nGCC compilers. Accordingly, the software in spack-pe-base can be used\nregardless of programming environment.\n\nspack-pe-gnu is based on the E4S Project and\nprovides performant HPC libraries built with PrgEnv-gnu and the nvcc CUDA\ncompiler driver for GPU code. spack-pe-gnu is dependent on both\nspack-pe-base and PrgEnv-gnu.\n\nUsing software from the Spack PE\n\nThe base suite of software tools and libraries can be accessed by loading the\nspack-pe-base module. This adds a path to $MODULEPATH which contains\nnumerous modules.\n\nFor example, to load cmake starting from the default environment, a user\nshould run the following commands:\nmodule use /soft/modulefiles\nmodule load spack-pe-base\nmodule load cmake\n\nThe spack-pe-base module adds paths to the user's MODULEPATH; individual packages are subsequently loaded through the newly available modules. The full list of available packages can be viewed by running module avail or module --show-hidden avail for a complete listing. Packages are loaded in the same way from spack-pe-gnu.\n\nInspecting packages\n\nWhen a module in the Spack PE is loaded, several environment variables are\nupdated to integrate the package into the user's environment. Additionally, the\nPACKAGE_ROOT variable is set to the path to the installation prefix of the\npackage. For example, after loading cmake as above:\n\n$ echo $CMAKE_ROOT\n/soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/install/linux-sles15-x86_64/gcc-12.3.0/cmake-3.27.7-a435jtzvweeos2es6enirbxdjdqhqgdp/\n$ ls -a $CMAKE_ROOT\n.  ..  bin  doc  share  .spack",

However, PyTorch JIT capabilities are newer and may not yield performance improvements.  Please see TorchScript for more information.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nPyTorch is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.

                "Use TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.  Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.  When possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention.\n\nUse XLA compilation on your code.  XLA is the Accelerated Linear Algebra library that is available in tensorFlow and critical in software like JAX.  XLA will compile a tf.Graph object, generated with tf.function or similar, and perform optimizations like operation-fusion.  XLA can give impressive performance boosts with almost no user changes except to set an environment variable TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2.  If your code is complex, or has dynamically sized tensors (tensors where the shape changes every iteration), XLA can be detrimental: the overhead for compiling functions can be large enough to mitigate performance improvements.  XLA is particularly powerful when combined with reduced precision, yielding speedups > 100% in some models.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nTensorFlow is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with tensorFlow has been seen with horovod in particular.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation.  Some polaris specific details that may be helpful to you:\n\nCPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.

Detailed user documentation is available here\n\nBuilding from Docker or Argonne GitHub Container Registry\n\nContainers on Polaris can be built by writing Dockerfiles on a local machine and then publish the container to DockerHub, or by directly building them on ALCF compute node by writing an Apptainer recipe file. If you prefer to use existing containers, you can pull them from various registries like DockerHub and run them on Polaris.\n\nSince Docker requires root privileges, which users do not have on Polaris, existing Docker containers must be converted to Apptainer.

Existing binaries are unlikely to run successfully.\n\nWe have held all jobs submitted prior to the upgrade as a user hold. Users may release their existing jobs with qrls to run after they have rebuilt their binaries.\n\nPBS does cache the job execution script.  If a change to the script is required due to a path changing post rebuild, the job will have to be resubmitted.\n\nAll application binaries should be rebuilt prior to further job submissions.\n\nRe-building user codes\n\nMany user codes will need to be re-built and/or re-linked against the newer version of the programming environment (23.12) and Spack provided dependencies.\n\nChanges to the user software environment\n\nIn addition to the system upgrades, several changes have been made to the user\nsoftware environment which may impact user workflows.\n\nOlder PE versions removed\n\nOlder versions of the Cray PE (older than 23.12) are deprecated as they are incompatible with the\nupgraded system stack and are no longer available for use.\n\nDatascience Anaconda Module Updates",

In this section we will explain an alternative method to run the ParaView server on Polaris using an interactive job, where the user can launch the ParaView server from the command line interface.\n\nNote: this is a method better suited for experienced users. If you are just starting with ParaView, we recommend the client/server mode as your primary method for using this tool.\n\nSetting up ParaView\n\nFrom your local client select Connect, either from the File menu, or by clicking on the icon circled below:\n\nA new window will open where you can configure a server. Click on Add Server:\n\nGive your server a name, select Client/Server, localhost, and a TCP port (8000 in this example)\n\nClick \"Configure\". In the next window there is an option to set up how ParaView server will be launched, and the default is \"Manual\". Leave it on \"Manual\" and click \"Save\".\n\nYou will use these settings when establishing the connection.\n\nLaunching the ParaView server on Polaris\n\nYou can launch an interactive session on Polaris compute nodes with the following command (adjust parameters as needed to match your allocation, desired number of nodes, queue, walltime, and filesystems):\n\nshell\nqsub -l walltime=01:00:00 -l select=2 -A yourallocation -q debug -I -l filesystems=home:grand\n\nWhen the job starts you will receive a prompt on your head node like this:\n\nusername@x3005c0s7b0n0:~>\n\nMake a note of the node hostname (x3005c0s7b0n0 in the example above). You can also get this information from qstat -fx jobID\n\nNow load the ParaView module\n\nusername@x3005c0s7b0n0:~> module use /soft/modulefiles \nusername@x3005c0s7b0n0:~> module load visualization/paraview/paraview-5.12.0-EGL\n\nand launch the ParaView server with",

                "Compiling and Linking Overview on Polaris\n\nCompiling on Polaris Login and Compute Nodes\n\nIf your build system does not require GPUs for the build process, as is usually the case, compilation of GPU-accelerated codes is generally expected to work well on the Polaris login nodes. If your build system does require GPUs, you cannot yet compile on the Polaris login nodes, as they do not currently have GPUs installed. You may in this case compile your applications on the Polaris compute nodes. Do this by submitting an interactive single-node job, or running your build system in a batch job.\n\nHome File System\n\nIs it helpful to realize that there is a single HOME filesystem for users that can be accessed from the login and computes of each production resource at ALCF. Thus, users should be mindful of modifications to their environments (e.g. .bashrc) that may cause issues to arise due to differences between the systems.\n\nCray Programming Environment\n\nThe Cray Programming Environment (PE) uses three compiler wrappers for building software. These compiler wrappers should be used when building MPI-enabled applications.\n\ncc - C compiler\n\nCC - C++ compiler\n\nftn - Fortran compiler\n\nEach of these wrappers can select a specific vendor compiler based on the PrgEnv module loaded in the environment. The following are some helpful options to understand what the compiler wrapper is invoking.\n\n--craype-verbose : Print the command which is forwarded to the compiler invocation\n\n--cray-print-opts=libs : Print library information\n\n--cray-print-opts=cflags : Print include information\n\nThe output from these commands may be useful in build scripts where a compiler other than that invoked by a compiler wrapper is desired. Defining some variables as such may prove useful in those situations.\nCRAY_CFLAGS=$(cc --cray-print-opts=cflags)\nCRAY_LIB=$(cc --cray-print-opts=libs)\nFurther documentation and options are available via man cc and similar.\n\nCompilers provided by Cray Programming Environments",

Using Color to Differentiate Data\n\nTo enable us to distinguish these two types of data from one other, we can vary their representations.\n\nOne way to do this is by setting the color of the two data sets to different colors.

It is written in an exceptionally clean style that makes it one of the more popular codes for users to extend and it currently has dozens of user-developed extensions.\n\nFor details about the code and its usage, see the LAMMPS home page. This page provides information specific to running on Polaris at the ALCF.\n\nUsing LAMMPS at ALCF\n\nALCF provides assistance with build instructions, compiling executables, submitting jobs, and providing prebuilt binaries (upon request). A collection of Makefiles and submission scripts are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo here. For questions, contact us at support@alcf.anl.gov.\n\nHow to Obtain the Code\n\nLAMMPS is an open-source code, which can be downloaded from the LAMMPS website.\n\nBuilding on Polaris\n\nAfter LAMMPS has been downloaded and unpacked on an ALCF filesystem, users should see a directory whose name is of the form lammps-<version>. One should then see the Makefile lammps-<version>/src/MAKE/MACHINES/Makefile.polaris in recent versions that can be used as a starting point for compilation on Polaris. Copies of Makefiles for building with the GPU/KOKKOS package using CUDA for GPU support with the GNU/NVHPC compiler are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo here. For older versions of LAMMPS, you may need to take an existing Makefile (e.g. Makefile.mpi) for your specific version of LAMMPS and edit the top portion appropratiately to create a new Makefile.polaris.\n\nKOKKOS package and GNU compilers\n\nThe following modules are useful for this particular build. Note, the cmake module is not required if using the GNU Makefile procedure to build LAMMPS. The initial module restore is just setting the default environment as the starting point. Users may find it useful to copy these module commands into a small helper script to assist with compiling and running LAMMPS (e.g. setup_lammps_gnu.sh).",

Adjust these values accordingly.\n\nAmong multiple lines with debug information,  you should see something like:\n\ndebug1: Local connections to LOCALHOST:8000 forwarded to remote address x3005c0s7b0n0:8000\n\nKeep this terminal open for the duration of your session to keep the ssh tunnel active.\n\nNow you are ready to launch your ParaView client locally. Keep in mind that client and servers versions must match.

The TensorFlow home page has more information about TensorFlow, which you can refer to.  For trouble shooting on Polaris, please contact support@alcf.anl.gov.\n\nInstallation on Polaris\n\nTensorFlow is already pre-installed on Polaris, available in the conda module.  To use it from a compute node, please do:\n\nbash\nmodule load conda\nconda activate\n\nThen, you can load TensorFlow in python as usual (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):\n\n```python\n\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.version\n'2.9.1'\n\n```\n\nThis installation of TensorFlow was built from source and the CUDA libraries it uses are found via the CUDA_HOME environment variable (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):\n\nbash\n$ echo $CUDA_HOME\n/soft/datascience/cuda/cuda_11.5.2_495.29.05_linux\n\nIf you need to build applications that use this version of TensorFlow and CUDA, we recommend using these cuda libraries to ensure compatibility.  We periodically update the TensorFlow release, though updates will come in the form of new versions of the conda module.\n\nTensorFlow is also available through NVIDIA containers that have been translated to Singularity containers.  For more information about containers, please see the Containers documentation page.\n\nTensorFlow Best Practices on Polaris\n\nSingle Node Performance\n\nWhen running TensorFlow applications, we have found the following practices to be generally, if not universally, useful and encourage you to try some of these techniques to boost performance of your own applications.\n\nUse Reduced Precision. Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with TensorFlow operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the tf.keras.mixed_precision Policy, as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  If you use a custom training loop (and not keras.Model.fit), you will also need to apply loss scaling.",

In this section we will explain an alternative method to run the ParaView server on Polaris using an interactive job, where the user can launch the ParaView server from the command line interface.\n\nNote: this is a method better suited for experienced users. If you are just starting with ParaView, we recommend the client/server mode as your primary method for using this tool.\n\nSetting up ParaView\n\nFrom your local client select Connect, either from the File menu, or by clicking on the icon circled below:\n\nA new window will open where you can configure a server. Click on Add Server:\n\nGive your server a name, select Client/Server, localhost, and a TCP port (8000 in this example)\n\nClick \"Configure\". In the next window there is an option to set up how ParaView server will be launched, and the default is \"Manual\". Leave it on \"Manual\" and click \"Save\".\n\nYou will use these settings when establishing the connection.\n\nLaunching the ParaView server on Polaris\n\nYou can launch an interactive session on Polaris compute nodes with the following command (adjust parameters as needed to match your allocation, desired number of nodes, queue, walltime, and filesystems):\n\nshell\nqsub -l walltime=01:00:00 -l select=2 -A yourallocation -q debug -I -l filesystems=home:grand\n\nWhen the job starts you will receive a prompt on your head node like this:\n\nusername@x3005c0s7b0n0:~>\n\nMake a note of the node hostname (x3005c0s7b0n0 in the example above).

For this reason, it is recommended to use start_method=\"spawn\" on Polaris when using the MpiExecLauncher as is shown in the example config above.  Alternatively, another solution is to use the GNUParallelLauncher which uses GNU Parallel to spawn processes.  GNU Parallel can be loaded in your environment with the command module load gnu-parallel.  Both of these approaches will circumvent the hang issue from using fork.\n\nUpdates\n\nFor parsl versions after July 2023, the address passed in the HighThroughputExecutor needs to be set to address = address_by_interface(\"bond0\").

If build your application is problematic for some reason (e.g. absence of a GPU), then users are encouraged to build and test applications directly on one of the Polaris compute nodes via an interactive job. The discussion below makes use of the NVHPC compilers in the default environment as illustrative examples. Similar examples for other compilers on Polaris are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo.\n\nCPU MPI+OpenMP Example\n\nOne of the first useful tasks with any new machine, scheduler, and job launcher is to ensure one is binding MPI ranks and OpenMP threads to the host cpu as intended. A simple HelloWorld MPI+OpenMP example is available here to get started with.\n\nThe application can be straightforwardly compiled using the Cray compiler wrappers.\nCC -fopenmp main.cpp -o hello_affinity\n\nThe executable hello_affinity can then be launched in a job script (or directly in shell of interactive job) using mpiexec as discussed here.\n\n```\n\n!/bin/sh\n\nPBS -l select=1:system=polaris\n\nPBS -l place=scatter\n\nPBS -l walltime=0:30:00\n\nPBS -l filesystems=home\n\nMPI example w/ 16 MPI ranks per node spread evenly across cores\n\nNNODES=wc -l < $PBS_NODEFILE\nNRANKS_PER_NODE=16\nNDEPTH=4\nNTHREADS=1\n\nNTOTRANKS=$(( NNODES * NRANKS_PER_NODE ))\necho \"NUM_OF_NODES= ${NNODES} TOTAL_NUM_RANKS= ${NTOTRANKS} RANKS_PER_NODE= ${NRANKS_PER_NODE} THREADS_PER_RANK= ${NTHREADS}\"\n\nmpiexec -n ${NTOTRANKS} --ppn ${NRANKS_PER_NODE} --depth=${NDEPTH} --cpu-bind depth ./hello_affinity\n```\n\nCUDA\n\nSeveral variants of C/C++ and Fortran CUDA examples are available here that include MPI and multi-gpu examples.\n\nOne can use the Cray compiler wrappers to compile GPU-enabled applications as well.

                "Controlling Where Your Job Runs\n\nIf you wish to have your job run on specific nodes form your select like this: -l select=1:vnode=<node name1>+1:vnode=<node name2>... . Obviously, that gets tedious for large jobs.\n\nIf you want to control the location of a few nodes, for example 2 out of 64, but the rest don't matter, you can do something like this: -l select=1:vnode=<node name1>+1:vnode=<node name2>+62:system=foo\n\nEvery node has a PBS resource called tier0 with a rack identifier and tier1 with a dragonfly group identifieer.  If you want all your nodes grouped in a rack, you can add the group specifier -l select=8:system=foo,place=scatter:group=tier0.  If you wanted everything in the same dragonfly group, replace tier0 with tier1.  Note that you have to also explicitly specify the place when you use group.  If you wanted a specific rack or dragonfly group instead of any of them, you are back to the select: -l select 10:tier0=x3001-g0.\n\nNetwork: Rack and Dragonfly Group Mappings\n\nRacks contain (7) 6U chassis; each chassis has 2 nodes for 14 nodes per rack\n\nThe hostnames are of the form xRRPPc0sUUb[0|1]n0 where:\nRR is the row {30, 31, 32}\nPP is the position in the row {30 goes 1-16, 31 and 32 go 1-12}\nc is chassis and is always 0\ns stands for slot, but in this case is the RU in the rack and values are {1,7,13,19,25,31,37}\nb is BMC controller and is 0 or 1 (each node has its own BMC)\nn is node, but is always 0 since there is only one node per BMC\n\nSo, 16+12+12 = 40 racks * 14 nodes per rack = 560 nodes.\n\nNote that in production group 9 (the last 4 racks) will be the designated on-demand racks\n\nThe management racks are x3000 and X3100 and are dragonfly group 10\n\nThe TDS rack is x3200 and is dragonfly group 11",

In this case, it will be important to have the craype-accel-nvidia80 module loaded both when compiling your application and during runtime to correctly link against a GPU Transport Layer (GTL) MPI library. Otherwise, you'll likely see GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED is requested, but GTL library is not linked errors during runtime.\n- If running on a specific GPU or subset of GPUs is desired, then the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable can be used. For example, if one only wanted an application to access the first two GPUs on a node, then setting CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 could be used.\n\nBinding MPI ranks to GPUs\n\nThe Cray MPI on Polaris does not currently support binding MPI ranks to GPUs. For applications that need this support, this instead can be handled by use of a small helper script that will appropriately set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES for each MPI rank. One example is available here where each MPI rank is similarly bound to a single GPU with round-robin assignment.\n\nA example set_affinity_gpu_polaris.sh script follows where GPUs are assigned round-robin to MPI ranks.\n\n```bash\n\n!/bin/bash -l\n\nnum_gpus=4\n\nneed to assign GPUs in reverse order due to topology\n\nSee Polaris Device Affinity Information:\n\nhttps://www.alcf.anl.gov/support/user-guides/polaris/hardware-overview/machine-overview/index.html",

For this reason, it is recommended to use start_method=\"spawn\" on Polaris when using the MpiExecLauncher as is shown in the example config above.  Alternatively, another solution is to use the GNUParallelLauncher which uses GNU Parallel to spawn processes.  GNU Parallel can be loaded in your environment with the command module load gnu-parallel.  Both of these approaches will circumvent the hang issue from using fork.\n\nUpdates\n\nFor parsl versions after July 2023, the address passed in the HighThroughputExecutor needs to be set to address = address_by_interface(\"bond0\").  With parsl versions prior to July 2023, it was recommended to use address = address_by_hostname() on Polaris, but with later versions this will not work on Polaris (or any other machine).",

                "LAMMPS\n\nOverview\n\nLAMMPS is a general-purpose molecular dynamics software package for massively parallel computers. It is written in an exceptionally clean style that makes it one of the more popular codes for users to extend and it currently has dozens of user-developed extensions.\n\nFor details about the code and its usage, see the LAMMPS home page. This page provides information specific to running on Polaris at the ALCF.\n\nUsing LAMMPS at ALCF\n\nALCF provides assistance with build instructions, compiling executables, submitting jobs, and providing prebuilt binaries (upon request). A collection of Makefiles and submission scripts are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo here. For questions, contact us at support@alcf.anl.gov.\n\nHow to Obtain the Code\n\nLAMMPS is an open-source code, which can be downloaded from the LAMMPS website.\n\nBuilding on Polaris\n\nAfter LAMMPS has been downloaded and unpacked on an ALCF filesystem, users should see a directory whose name is of the form lammps-<version>. One should then see the Makefile lammps-<version>/src/MAKE/MACHINES/Makefile.polaris in recent versions that can be used as a starting point for compilation on Polaris. Copies of Makefiles for building with the GPU/KOKKOS package using CUDA for GPU support with the GNU/NVHPC compiler are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo here. For older versions of LAMMPS, you may need to take an existing Makefile (e.g. Makefile.mpi) for your specific version of LAMMPS and edit the top portion appropratiately to create a new Makefile.polaris.\n\nKOKKOS package and GNU compilers\n\nThe following modules are useful for this particular build. Note, the cmake module is not required if using the GNU Makefile procedure to build LAMMPS. The initial module restore is just setting the default environment as the starting point. Users may find it useful to copy these module commands into a small helper script to assist with compiling and running LAMMPS (e.g. setup_lammps_gnu.sh).",

This engine is then used to generate random numbers.\n\nThe `dis(gen)` expression uses the generated random number as input to the uniform distribution, effectively generating a random real number within the range [1.0, 2.0).

The code initializes matrices A, B, and C, allocates memory on the device using SYCL, copies host data to the device, performs GEMM using `cblas_dgemm`, and then verifies the results.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the `cblas_dgemm` function call**\nThe `cblas_dgemm` function call is used to perform GEMM using CBLAS. The function takes several arguments:\n```cpp\ncblas_dgemm(CblasRowMajor, CblasNoTrans, CblasNoTrans, m, n, k, alpha, A, ldA, B, ldB, beta, C_cblas, ldC);\n```\nThese arguments specify the matrix layout (row-major), the transposes of matrices A and B, the dimensions of the matrices, and the input and output matrices.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the purpose of `cblas_dgemm`**\nThe purpose of the `cblas_dgemm` function call is to perform a GEMM operation using CBLAS. This operation multiplies two matrices (A and B) and adds the result to another matrix (C_cblas). The resulting matrix, C_cblas, is stored in memory.\n\n**Final Answer**\n<ANSWER>: The purpose of the `cblas_dgemm` function call is to perform General Matrix Multiplication using CBLAS."

                "ParaView on Polaris\n\nThe recommended way of running ParaView on Polaris is in client/server mode. This consists of running the ParaView client on your local resource, and the ParaView server on the Polaris compute nodes. The ParaView client needs to first be installed on your local resource, and needs to match the version that you run on Polaris.\n\nThere are multiple versions of ParaView installed on Polaris. To find the versions of ParaView currently available on Polaris run the following command on a login node: \nmodule use /soft/modulefiles\nmodule avail paraview\n\nBinary and source packages of the ParaView client for Linux, MacOS, and Windows are available from the ParaView Download Page.\n\nConnecting to the ParaView server on Polaris\n\nThis section describes how to launch the ParaView server on Polaris from a local ParaView client.\n\nStart ParaView Client\n\nFirst, launch the ParaView client on your local resource. You will need to configure some server settings in the client. This initial set up should only need to be done once, and can be reused each time you want to run ParaView on Polaris.\n\nServer Configuration\n\n1. Select Connect\n\nFrom the ParaView client choose to connect to a server by either clicking on the \"Connect\" icon in the menu bar\n\nor selecting File->Connect from the main menu\n\n2. Set Up Servers (first time only)\n\nThe first time you want to run a server on Polaris and have it connect to your local ParaView client, you will need to set up a Server. Once this server is set up, you can reuse it each time you run the ParaView client with the ParaView server on Polaris.\n\nKitware, the developers of ParaView, maintain a database of server configurations which you can retrieve through the ParaView client. In the File->Connect menu press the button named \"Fetch Servers\" and select POLARIS@ANL. Windows users should select \"windows to POLARIS@ANL\". Press \"Import Selected\"\n\n3. Use ParaView",

        "cot_answer": "To answer this question, I will provide step-by-step reasoning on how to identify the main libraries being used and their functions.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the libraries**\nThe code snippet provided contains several library calls. The first one is `cblas_dgemm`, which is a function from the CBLAS (C Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) library. This library provides basic linear algebra operations, such as matrix multiplication.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the OneAPI libraries**\nThe next set of library calls are related to OneAPI and OpenMP. The `sycl::queue` object is created using the `sycl::property_list` class, which allows for customization of the queue properties. This suggests that we are working with the SYCL (Streamed eXtreme Compiler) library, which is part of the OneAPI framework.\n\nThe `oneapi::mkl::blas::column_major::gemm` function call is also related to OneAPI and OpenMP. This function performs a matrix multiplication using the MKL (Math Kernel Library) library, which provides optimized linear algebra operations.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the AOCL library**\nFinally, we see references to the AOCL (Accelerated Computing Library) library in the form of `module load aocl`. This suggests that we are working with the AOCL library, which is used for CPU GEMM (General Matrix-Matrix Multiplication).\n\n**Final Answer**\n<ANSWER>: The main libraries being used are CBLAS, OneAPI (SYCL and MKL), and AOCL. Their functions include basic linear algebra operations, matrix multiplication, and optimized linear algebra operations.\n\nNote: The final answer is based on the provided context and may not be a direct copy-paste from the code snippet."

The following sequence of module commands can be used to switch to the GNU programming environment (gcc, g++, gfortran) and also have NVIDIA compilers available in your path.\n\nmodule swap PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-gnu\nmodule load nvhpc-mixed\n\nThe compilers invoked by the Cray MPI wrappers are listed for each programming environment in the following table.\n\nmodule C C++ Fortran MPI Compiler Wrapper cc CC ftn PrgEnv-nvhpc nvc nvc++ nvfortran PrgEnv-gnu gcc g++ gfortran\n\nNote, while gcc and g++ may be available in the default environment, the PrgEnv-gnu module is needed to provide gfortran.\n\nAdditional Compilers Provided by ALCF\n\nThe ALCF additionally provides compilers to enable the OpenMP and SYCL programming models for GPUs viaLLVM as documented here\n\nAdditional documentation for using compilers is available on the respective programming model pages: OpenMP and SYCL.\n\nLinking\n\nDynamic linking of libraries is currently the default on Polaris. The Cray MPI wrappers will handle this automatically.\n\nNotes on Default Modules\n\ncraype-x86-rome: While the Polaris compute nodes currently have Milan CPUs, this module is loaded by default to avoid the craype-x86-milan module from adding a zen3 target not supported in the default nvhpc/21.9 compilers. The craype-x86-milan module is expected to be made default once a newer nvhpc version (e.g. 22.5) is made the default.\n\ncraype-accel-nvidia80: This module adds compiler flags to enable GPU acceleration for NVHPC compilers along with gpu-enabled MPI libraries as it is assumed that the majority of applications to be compiled on Polaris will target the GPUs for acceleration. Users building cpu-only applications may find it useful to unload this module to silence \"gpu code generation\" warnings.\n\nMixed C/C++ & Fortran Applications",

If your build system does require GPUs, you cannot yet compile on the Polaris login nodes, as they do not currently have GPUs installed. You may in this case compile your applications on the Polaris compute nodes. Do this by submitting an interactive single-node job, or running your build system in a batch job.\n\nHome File System\n\nIs it helpful to realize that there is a single HOME filesystem for users that can be accessed from the login and computes of each production resource at ALCF. Thus, users should be mindful of modifications to their environments (e.g. .bashrc) that may cause issues to arise due to differences between the systems.\n\nCray Programming Environment\n\nThe Cray Programming Environment (PE) uses three compiler wrappers for building software. These compiler wrappers should be used when building MPI-enabled applications.\n\ncc - C compiler\n\nCC - C++ compiler\n\nftn - Fortran compiler\n\nEach of these wrappers can select a specific vendor compiler based on the PrgEnv module loaded in the environment. The following are some helpful options to understand what the compiler wrapper is invoking.\n\n--craype-verbose : Print the command which is forwarded to the compiler invocation\n\n--cray-print-opts=libs : Print library information\n\n--cray-print-opts=cflags : Print include information\n\nThe output from these commands may be useful in build scripts where a compiler other than that invoked by a compiler wrapper is desired. Defining some variables as such may prove useful in those situations.\nCRAY_CFLAGS=$(cc --cray-print-opts=cflags)\nCRAY_LIB=$(cc --cray-print-opts=libs)\nFurther documentation and options are available via man cc and similar.\n\nCompilers provided by Cray Programming Environments",

                "Parsl on Polaris\n\nParsl is a flexible and scalable parallel programming library for Python.\n\n-- Parsl Documentation\n\nFor many applications, managing an ensemble of jobs into a workflow is a critical step that can easily become a performance bottleneck.  Many tools exist to address this, of which parsl is just one.  On this page, we'll highlight some of the key pieces of information about parsl that are relevant to Polaris.  Parsl is also extensively documented, has a dedicated Slack Channel, and a large community of users and developers beyond ALCF.  We encourage you to engage with the parsl community for support with parsl specific questions, and for Polaris-specific questions or problems, please contact support@alcf.anl.gov.\n\nGetting Parsl on Polaris\n\nYou can install parsl building off of the conda modules.  You have some flexibility in how you want to extend the conda module to include parsl, but here is an example way to do it:\n\n```python\n\nLoad the Conda Module (needed everytime you use parsl)\n\nmodule load conda\nconda activate\n\nCreate a virtual env that uses the conda env as the system packages.\n\nOnly do the next line on initial set up:\n\npython -m venv --system-site-packages /path/to/your/virtualenv\n\nLoad the virtual env (every time):\n\nsource /path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/activate\n\nInstall parsl (only once)\n\npip install parsl\n\n```\n\nUsing Parsl on Polaris\n\nParsl has a variety of possible configuration settings.  As an example, we provide the configuration below that will run one task per GPU:\n\n```python\nfrom parsl.config import Config\n\nPBSPro is the right provider for Polaris:\n\nfrom parsl.providers import PBSProProvider\n\nThe high throughput executor is for scaling to HPC systems:\n\nfrom parsl.executors import HighThroughputExecutor\n\nYou can use the MPI launcher, but may want the Gnu Parallel launcher, see below\n\nfrom parsl.launchers import MpiExecLauncher, GnuParallelLauncher\n\naddress_by_interface is needed for the HighThroughputExecutor:",

                "Running Multiple MPI Applications on a node\n\nMultiple applications can be run simultaneously on a node by launching several mpiexec commands and backgrounding them. For performance, it will likely be necessary to ensure that each application runs on a distinct set of CPU resources and/or targets specific GPUs. One can provide a list of CPUs using the --cpu-bind option, which when combined with CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES provides a user with specifying exactly which CPU and GPU resources to run each application on. In the example below, four instances of the application are simultaneously running on a single node. In the first instance, the application is spawning MPI ranks 0-7 on CPUs 24-31 and using GPU 0. This mapping is based on output from the nvidia-smi topo -m command and pairs CPUs with the closest GPU.\n\n```bash\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:24:25:26:27:28:29:30:31 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:16:17:18:19:20:21:22:23 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:8:9:10:11:12:13:14:15 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=3\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:0:1:2:3:4:5:6:7 ./hello_affinity &\n\nwait\n```\n\nCompute Node Access to the Internet\n\nCurrently, the only access the internet is via a proxy.  Here are the proxy environment variables for Polaris:\n\nbash\nexport http_proxy=\"http://proxy.alcf.anl.gov:3128\"\nexport https_proxy=\"http://proxy.alcf.anl.gov:3128\"\nexport ftp_proxy=\"http://proxy.alcf.anl.gov:3128\"\n\nIn the future, though we don't have a timeline on this because it depends on future features in slingshot and internal software development, we intend to have public IP addresses be a schedulable resource.  For instance, if only your head node needed public access your select statement might looks something like: -l select=1:pubnet=True+63.\n\nControlling Where Your Job Runs",

                "Use TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.  Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.  When possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention.\n\nUse XLA compilation on your code.  XLA is the Accelerated Linear Algebra library that is available in tensorFlow and critical in software like JAX.  XLA will compile a tf.Graph object, generated with tf.function or similar, and perform optimizations like operation-fusion.  XLA can give impressive performance boosts with almost no user changes except to set an environment variable TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2.  If your code is complex, or has dynamically sized tensors (tensors where the shape changes every iteration), XLA can be detrimental: the overhead for compiling functions can be large enough to mitigate performance improvements.  XLA is particularly powerful when combined with reduced precision, yielding speedups > 100% in some models.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nTensorFlow is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with tensorFlow has been seen with horovod in particular.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation.  Some polaris specific details that may be helpful to you:\n\nCPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.  In particular, we encourage users to try their scaling measurements with the following settings:\n\nSet the environment variable NCCL_COLLNET_ENABLE=1",

For questions, contact us at support@alcf.anl.gov.\n\nHow to Obtain the Code\n\nLAMMPS is an open-source code, which can be downloaded from the LAMMPS website.\n\nBuilding on Polaris\n\nAfter LAMMPS has been downloaded and unpacked on an ALCF filesystem, users should see a directory whose name is of the form lammps-<version>. One should then see the Makefile lammps-<version>/src/MAKE/MACHINES/Makefile.polaris in recent versions that can be used as a starting point for compilation on Polaris. Copies of Makefiles for building with the GPU/KOKKOS package using CUDA for GPU support with the GNU/NVHPC compiler are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo here. For older versions of LAMMPS, you may need to take an existing Makefile (e.g. Makefile.mpi) for your specific version of LAMMPS and edit the top portion appropratiately to create a new Makefile.polaris.\n\nKOKKOS package and GNU compilers\n\nThe following modules are useful for this particular build. Note, the cmake module is not required if using the GNU Makefile procedure to build LAMMPS. The initial module restore is just setting the default environment as the starting point. Users may find it useful to copy these module commands into a small helper script to assist with compiling and running LAMMPS (e.g. setup_lammps_gnu.sh).",

        "question": "What is the role of the \"omp_is_initial_device()\" function in OpenMP?",
        "cot_answer": "To answer this question, I will provide step-by-step reasoning.\n\nThe `omp_is_initial_device()` function is used to determine whether the current device is the initial device or not. In OpenMP, the initial device is the device that executes the parallel region and spawns other devices as needed.\n\nIn the given context, we can see that the function is being used in a target region, which is a construct that allows offloading code execution to accelerators such as GPUs or FPGAs.\n\n##begin_quote##\nif( !omp_is_initial_device() )\n  printf( \"Hello world from accelerator.\\n\" );\nelse\n  printf( \"Hello world from host.\\n\" );\n##end_quote##\n\nFrom this code, we can see that if the current device is not the initial device, it prints a message indicating that it's executing on an accelerator. If it is the initial device, it prints a message indicating that it's executing on the host.\n\nTherefore, the role of `omp_is_initial_device()` in OpenMP is to allow devices other than the initial device to execute code and perform tasks, while also providing a way for the initial device to distinguish itself from other devices.\n\n<ANSWER>: The role of `omp_is_initial_device()` is to determine whether the current device is the initial device or not."

                "Use Reduced Precision. Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with PyTorch operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the PyTorch Automatic Mixed Precision package (AMP), as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  In PyTorch, users generally need to manage casting and loss scaling manually,  though context managers and function decorators can provide easy tools to do this.\n\nPyTorch has a JIT module as well as backends to support op fusion, similar to TensorFlow's tf.function tools.  However, PyTorch JIT capabilities are newer and may not yield performance improvements.  Please see TorchScript for more information.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nPyTorch is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with PyTorch has been seen with both DDP and Horovod.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation or the Distributed Data Parallel documentation.  Some Polaris-specific details that may be helpful to you:\n\nCPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.  In particular, we encourage users to try their scaling measurements with the following settings:\n\nSet the environment variable NCCL_COLLNET_ENABLE=1\n\nSet the environment varialbe NCCL_NET_GDR_LEVEL=PHB\n\nManually set the CPU affinity via mpiexec, such as with --cpu-bind verbose,list:0,8,16,24",
