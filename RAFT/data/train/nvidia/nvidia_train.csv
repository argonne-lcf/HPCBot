Horovod and DDP work best when you limit the visible devices to only one GPU.  Note that if you import mpi4py or horovod, and then do something like os.environ[""CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES""] = hvd.local_rank(), it may not actually work!  You must set the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable prior to doing MPI.COMM_WORLD.init(), which is done in horovod.init() as well as implicitly in from mpi4py import MPI.   On Polaris specifically, you can use the environment variable PMI_LOCAL_RANK (as well as PMI_LOCAL_SIZE) to learn information about the node-local MPI ranks.

DeepSpeed

DeepSpeed is also available and usable on Polaris.  For more information, please see the DeepSpeed documentation directly.

PyTorch DataLoader and multi-node Horovod

Please note there is a bug that causes a hang when using PyTorch's multithreaded data loaders with distributed training across multiple nodes. To workaround this, NVIDIA recommends setting num_workers=0 in the dataloader configuration, which serializes data loading.

For more details, see Polaris Known Issues.</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>QMCPACK on Polaris

QMCPACK, is a modern high-performance open-source Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation code. Its main applications are electronic structure calculations of molecular, quasi-2D and solid-state systems. Variational Monte Carlo (VMC), diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) and a number of other advanced QMC algorithms are implemented. Orbital space auxiliary field QMC (AFQMC) has recently been added. By directly solving the Schrodinger equation, QMC methods offer greater accuracy than methods such as density functional theory, but at a trade-off of much greater computational expense.

Prebuilt executables are provided at /soft/applications/qmcpack.
The directory of each installation also includes a job submission script example qmcpack-polaris.job.
Update build recipe is provided on GitHub.</DOCUMENT>

Introduction

CUDA-GDB is the NVIDIA tool for debugging CUDA applications running on Polaris. CUDA-GDB is an extension to GDB, the GNU Project debugger. The tool provides developers with a mechanism for debugging CUDA applications running on actual hardware. This enables developers to debug applications without the potential variations introduced by simulation and emulation environments.

Step-by-step guide

Debug Compilation

NVCC, the NVIDIA CUDA compiler driver, provides a mechanism for generating the debugging information necessary for CUDA-GDB to work properly. The -g -G option pair must be passed to NVCC when an application is compiled for ease of debugging with CUDA-GDB; for example,
nvcc -g -G foo.cu -o foo
Using this line to compile the CUDA application foo.cu
* forces -O0 compilation, with the exception of very limited dead-code eliminations and register-spilling optimizations.
* makes the compiler include debug information in the executable

Running CUDA-gdb on Polaris compute nodes

Start an interactive job mode on Polaris as follows:

```
$ qsub -I -l select=1 -l walltime=1:00:00

$ cuda-gdb --version

This is a collection of known issues that have been encountered on Polaris. Documentation will be updated as issues are resolved. Users are encouraged to email support@alcf.anl.gov to report issues.

Submitting Jobs

For batch job submissions, if the parameters within your submission script do not meet the parameters of any of the execution queues (small, ..., backfill-large) you might not receive the ""Job submission"" error on the command line at all, and the job will never appear in history qstat -xu <username> (current bug in PBS). E.g. if a user submits a script to the prod routing queue requesting 10 nodes for 24 hours, exceeding ""Time Max"" of 6 hrs of the small execution queue (which handles jobs with 10-24 nodes), then it may behave as if the job was never submitted.

Job scripts are copied to temporary locations after qsub and any changes to the original script while the job is queued will not be reflected in the copied script. Furthermore, qalter requires -A <allocation name> when changing job properties. Currently, there is a request for a qalter-like command to trigger a re-copy of the original script to the temporary location.

<DOCUMENT>Note: that the particles.000* is still visible.

Unhide the particles.000*data: click Eye icon

Select particles.000*data: click on name

Filters->Alphabetical->Glyph or click on the Glyph icon from the menu bar

Glyph Type: Sphere

Radius:. 0.15

Orient: Unchecked

Scale Mode: off

Set Scale Factor: 1 - Edit: Checked

Maximum Number of Points: 3000

Mask Points: Checked

Random Mode: Unchecked

Click the Apply button

Since our goal was to unclutter the display, let's hide the particles.000*by toggling them off, by clicking on the Eye icon next to it in the Pipeline Browser

Let's also switch to the Display tab in the Object Inspector, with Glyph1 selected, and change the Color by value to GlyphVector. Since the GlyphVector value is based on the velocity. We can Edit Color Map...and choose the same Blue to Red Rainbow preset that we previously chose for velocity

12. Enter: Red Blood Cells

Now let's add in both of the other data sets, which are polygonal meshes which make up Red Blood Cells (RBCs).

These two data sets are essentially the same kind of data, so we can apply the same filters and make the same types of representation changes to each of them. However, some of the RBCs are marked by the simulation that generated them as healthy (rbc.000) and some of them are marked as diseased (bad_rbc.000).

Unhide the rbc.000 and bad_rbc.000 data sets by clicking the Eye icon next to each of them to make them visible

13. Using Color to Differentiate Data

To enable us to distinguish these two types of data from one other, we can vary their representations.

One way to do this is by setting the color of the two data sets to different colors. Repeat this process for each of rbc.000 and bad_rbc.000, picking different colors.

Select one of the rbc data sets in the Pipeline Browser

Go to the Displaytab in the Object Inspector

In the Color by:dropdown select Solid Color

Click on the Set Solid Color... button

Select a color from the Select Colordialog that appears</DOCUMENT>

Context: <DOCUMENT>3. Use ParaView

After the previous step, you can now select POLARIS@ANL in the File->Connect menu and press Connect

At this point a new window will pop up

There are a number of parameters that you must enter manually here:

Xterm executable: the path of a terminal on your system. The figure shows the case of a Mac with XQuartz. You may need to change these values for Windows or Linux.

SSH executable: the name of your ssh command. It may be different on Windows depending on the ssh client installed (i.e putty)

Remote machine: leave this value at polaris.alcf.anl.gov

Username: your ALCF user name

ParaView version: the version of Paraview that you want to use. Verify first that this version is installed on the system (as described at the top of this document). You will also need to add a -EGL suffix.

Example:
5.12.0-EGL

Client port: it is safe to use the default value

Server port: is is safe to use the default value

Number of nodes to reserve: enter the number of Polaris compute nodes you want to use for your job

Number of ranks per node: enter the number of ranks per node

Number of minutes to reserve: the duration of your job in minutes

Account: enter here the name of your ALCF allocation

Queue: the name of the Polaris queue you would like to use (i.e: debug for small, quick jobs, prod, preemptable)

File Systems: enter here the file systems you need for your job, separated with colons, no spaces. Keep in mind that your job may not run if one of these file systems is not available at that time, so enter these values carefully

Job name: safe to use default value. The PBS scheduler will assign this name to your job

Now you can press OK to establish the connection with a ParaView server on Polaris.

An ssh connection will be established with a Polaris login node and a password will be requested in a terminal, similar to the process you normally use to connect and work on the system.</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>[""Use TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.  Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.  When possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention.\n\nUse XLA compilation on your code.  XLA is the Accelerated Linear Algebra library that is available in tensorFlow and critical in software like JAX.  XLA will compile a tf.Graph object, generated with tf.function or similar, and perform optimizations like operation-fusion.  XLA can give impressive performance boosts with almost no user changes except to set an environment variable TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2.  If your code is complex, or has dynamically sized tensors (tensors where the shape changes every iteration), XLA can be detrimental: the overhead for compiling functions can be large enough to mitigate performance improvements.  XLA is particularly powerful when combined with reduced precision, yielding speedups > 100% in some models.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nTensorFlow is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with tensorFlow has been seen with horovod in particular.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation.  Some polaris specific details that may be helpful to you:\n\nCPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.  In particular, we encourage users to try their scaling measurements with the following settings:\n\nSet the environment variable NCCL_COLLNET_ENABLE=1"", 'data/md/polaris/data-science-workflows/frameworks/tensorflow.md']</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Building on Polaris

The following table shows what compiler and flags to use with which PrgEnv:

module compiler flags PrgEnv-nvhpc cc/CC/ftn (nvc/nvc++/nvfortran) -mp=gpu -gpu=cc80 llvm mpicc/mpicxx (clang/clang++) -fopenmp -fopenmp-targets=nvptx64-nvidia-cuda PrgEnv-gnu cc/CC/ftn (gcc/g++/gfortran) -fopenmp PrgEnv-cray cc/CC/ftn -fopenmp

For example to compile a simple code hello.cpp:

For PrgEnv-nvhpc, after loading the modules as discussed above we would use:

CC -mp=gpu -gpu=cc80 hello.cpp
ftn -mp=gpu -gpu=cc80 hello.F90

For LLVM, after loading the modules as discussed above:

mpicxx -fopenmp -fopenmp-targets=nvptx64-nvidia-cuda hello.cpp

For PrgEnv-gnu, after loading the modules as discussed above we would use:

CC -fopenmp hello.cpp
ftn -fopenmp hello.F90

For PrgEnv-cray, after loading the modules as discussed above we would use:

CC -fopenmp hello.cpp
ftn -fopenmp hello.F90

Running on Polaris

To run, you can run the produced executable or with mpiexec in a job script, and then submit the script to the Polaris queue, like:

```
$ cat submit.sh

!/bin/sh

PBS -l select=1:system=polaris

PBS -l walltime=0:30:00

PBS -q debug

PBS -A Catalyst

PBS -l filesystems=home:eagle

cd ${PBS_O_WORKDIR}
 mpiexec -n 1 ./executable
$ # submit to the queue:
$ qsub -l select=1:system=polaris -l walltime=0:30:00 -l filesystems=home:eagle -q debug -A Catalyst ./submit.sh
```

In the above, having the PBS options in the script and on the command line is redundant, but we put it there to show both ways of launching. This submits the script to one node in the debug queue on Polaris, requesting 30 min and the eagle and home filesystems. It will charge project Catalyst for the time.

More details for setting up the job script are in Job Scheduling and Execution section.

```
$ cat hello.cpp

- Set MPI4JAX_USE_CUDA_MPI=1 to use CUDA-Aware MPI, supported in the conda module, to do operations directly from the GPU.
- Set MPICH_GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED=1 to use CUDA-Aware MPI.

The following code, based off of a test script from the mpi4jax repository, can help you verify you are using mpi4jax properly:

```python
import os
from mpi4py import MPI
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
import mpi4jax

comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD
rank = comm.Get_rank()
local_rank = int(os.environ[""PMI_LOCAL_RANK""])

available_devices = jax.devices(""gpu"")
if len(available_devices) <= local_rank:
    raise Exception(""Could not find enough GPUs"")

target_device = available_devices[local_rank]

@jax.jit
def foo(arr):
   arr = arr + rank
   arr_sum, _ = mpi4jax.allreduce(arr, op=MPI.SUM, comm=comm)
   return arr_sum

with jax.default_device(target_device):
    a = jnp.zeros((3, 3))
    print(f""Rank {rank}, local rank {local_rank}, a.device is {a.device()}"")
    result = foo(a)
    print(f""Rank {rank}, local rank {local_rank}, result.device is {result.device()}"")

if rank == 0:
   print(result)

```

JAX and mpi4jax are both still somewhat early in their software lifecycles.  Updates are frequent, and if you require assistance please contact support@alcf.anl.gov.</DOCUMENT>

Context: <DOCUMENT>ParaView on Polaris

The recommended way of running ParaView on Polaris is in client/server mode. This consists of running the ParaView client on your local resource, and the ParaView server on the Polaris compute nodes. The ParaView client needs to first be installed on your local resource, and needs to match the version that you run on Polaris.

There are multiple versions of ParaView installed on Polaris. To find the versions of ParaView currently available on Polaris run the following command on a login node: 
module use /soft/modulefiles
module avail paraview

Binary and source packages of the ParaView client for Linux, MacOS, and Windows are available from the ParaView Download Page.

Connecting to the ParaView server on Polaris

This section describes how to launch the ParaView server on Polaris from a local ParaView client.

Start ParaView Client

First, launch the ParaView client on your local resource. You will need to configure some server settings in the client. This initial set up should only need to be done once, and can be reused each time you want to run ParaView on Polaris.

Server Configuration

1. Select Connect

From the ParaView client choose to connect to a server by either clicking on the ""Connect"" icon in the menu bar

or selecting File->Connect from the main menu

2. Set Up Servers (first time only)

The first time you want to run a server on Polaris and have it connect to your local ParaView client, you will need to set up a Server. Once this server is set up, you can reuse it each time you run the ParaView client with the ParaView server on Polaris.

Kitware, the developers of ParaView, maintain a database of server configurations which you can retrieve through the ParaView client. In the File->Connect menu press the button named ""Fetch Servers"" and select POLARIS@ANL. Windows users should select ""windows to POLARIS@ANL"". Press ""Import Selected""

3. Use ParaView</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>In case you want write portable GPU kernels we highly recommend the KernelAbstractions.jl package. It provides a high-level abstraction for writing GPU kernels that can be compiled for different GPU backends.

julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(""KernelAbstractions"")'

By loading either oneAPI.jl, AMDGPU.jl, or CUDA.jl (see quickstart guide below).

CUDA-aware MPI

MPI.jl supports CUDA-aware MPI. This is enabled by setting the following environment variables.

bash
export JULIA_CUDA_MEMORY_POOL=none
export MPICH_GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED=1
export JULIA_MPI_PATH=${CRAY_MPICH_DIR}
export JULIA_MPI_HAS_CUDA=1

Note that MPI.jl needs to be rebuilt for the changes to take effect.

bash
julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.build(""MPI"")'

HDF5 Support

Parallel HDF5 support is provided by
module load cray-hdf5-parallel
After setting export JULIA_HDF5_PATH=$HDF5_DIR we can install the HDF5.jl package.

julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(""HDF5"")'

To remove warning messages indicating that use of JULIA_HDF5_PATH has been deprecated, one can use the following command to set the HDF5 libraries.

```
$ echo $CRAY_HDF5_PARALLEL_PREFIX/
/opt/cray/pe/hdf5-parallel/1.12.2.9/nvidia/23.3

$ julia --project -e 'using HDF5; HDF5.API.set_libraries!(""/opt/cray/pe/hdf5-parallel/1.12.2.9/nvidia/23.3/lib/libhdf5.so"", ""/opt/cray/pe/hdf5-parallel/1.12.2.9/nvidia/23.3/lib/libhdf5_hl.so"")'
```

Quickstart Guide

The following example shows how to use MPI.jl, CUDA.jl, and HDF5.jl to write a
parallel program that computes the sum of two vectors on the GPU and writes the
result to an HDF5 file. A repository with an example code computing an
approximation of pi can be found at
Polaris.jl. In this repository, you will also find
a setup_polaris.sh script that will build the HDF5.jl and MPI.jl package for the system libraries.
The dependencies are installed with the following commands:

<DOCUMENT>Datascience Anaconda Module Updates

We have updated the datascience Anaconda module and built various packages and libraries with CUDA 12.4.1 to be compatible with 
the new Polaris NVIDIA GPU hardware driver (CUDA 12.2) and to use the latest MPI, NCCL, cuDNN, TensorRT, etc. libraries. 
PyTorch 2.3.0 and TensorFlow 2.16.1 are now available as part of this module.

To use the new environment, type:
module use /soft/modulefiles 
module load conda; conda activate

/soft refresh and default $MODULEPATH change

Due to the new system software stack, /soft has been purged to allow for
software to be rebuilt. In addition, /soft/modulefiles is no longer in the
default $MODULEPATH. To access modules installed in /soft, users should run
module use /soft/modulefiles.

Adding module use /soft/modulefiles to your profile should approximate the old behavior.

Modules removed

The following modules have been removed:</DOCUMENT>

Context: <DOCUMENT>Compilers provided by Cray Programming Environments

The default programming environment on Polaris is currently NVHPC. The GNU compilers are available via another programming environment. The following sequence of module commands can be used to switch to the GNU programming environment (gcc, g++, gfortran) and also have NVIDIA compilers available in your path.

module swap PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-gnu
module load nvhpc-mixed

The compilers invoked by the Cray MPI wrappers are listed for each programming environment in the following table.

module C C++ Fortran MPI Compiler Wrapper cc CC ftn PrgEnv-nvhpc nvc nvc++ nvfortran PrgEnv-gnu gcc g++ gfortran

Note, while gcc and g++ may be available in the default environment, the PrgEnv-gnu module is needed to provide gfortran.

Additional Compilers Provided by ALCF

The ALCF additionally provides compilers to enable the OpenMP and SYCL programming models for GPUs viaLLVM as documented here

Additional documentation for using compilers is available on the respective programming model pages: OpenMP and SYCL.

Linking

Dynamic linking of libraries is currently the default on Polaris. The Cray MPI wrappers will handle this automatically.

Notes on Default Modules

craype-x86-rome: While the Polaris compute nodes currently have Milan CPUs, this module is loaded by default to avoid the craype-x86-milan module from adding a zen3 target not supported in the default nvhpc/21.9 compilers. The craype-x86-milan module is expected to be made default once a newer nvhpc version (e.g. 22.5) is made the default.

craype-accel-nvidia80: This module adds compiler flags to enable GPU acceleration for NVHPC compilers along with gpu-enabled MPI libraries as it is assumed that the majority of applications to be compiled on Polaris will target the GPUs for acceleration. Users building cpu-only applications may find it useful to unload this module to silence ""gpu code generation"" warnings.

Large-scale parallelism

CUDA.jl uses the nvcc compiler to compile GPU kernels. This will create object files in the TEMP filesystem. The default TMPDIR in a job on Polaris is set to a temp directory that only exists on the head node of a job. We recommend setting TEMPDIR to a local directory on each compute node.

Context: <DOCUMENT>Example Programs and Makefiles for Polaris

Several simple examples of building CPU and GPU-enabled codes on Polaris are available in the ALCF GettingStart repo for several programming models. If build your application is problematic for some reason (e.g. absence of a GPU), then users are encouraged to build and test applications directly on one of the Polaris compute nodes via an interactive job. The discussion below makes use of the NVHPC compilers in the default environment as illustrative examples. Similar examples for other compilers on Polaris are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo.

CPU MPI+OpenMP Example

One of the first useful tasks with any new machine, scheduler, and job launcher is to ensure one is binding MPI ranks and OpenMP threads to the host cpu as intended. A simple HelloWorld MPI+OpenMP example is available here to get started with.

The application can be straightforwardly compiled using the Cray compiler wrappers.
CC -fopenmp main.cpp -o hello_affinity

The executable hello_affinity can then be launched in a job script (or directly in shell of interactive job) using mpiexec as discussed here.

<DOCUMENT>OpenMP

Overview

The OpenMP API is an open standard for parallel programming. The specification document can be found here: https://www.openmp.org. The specification describes directives, runtime routines, and environment variables that allow an application developer to express parallelism (e.g. shared memory multiprocessing and device offloading). Many compiler vendors provide implementations of the OpenMP specification (https://www.openmp.org/specifications).

Setting the environment to use OpenMP on Polaris

Many of the programming environments available on Polaris have OpenMP support.

module OpenMP CPU support? OpenMP GPU support? PrgEnv-nvhpc yes yes llvm yes yes PrgEnv-gnu yes no PrgEnv-cray yes yes*

Currently PrgEnv-cray is not recommended for OpenMP offload.

By default, the PrgEnv-nvhpc module is loaded. To switch to other modules, you can use module switch.

Using PrgEnv-nvhpc

This is loaded by default, so there's no need to load additional modules. You can confirm that it is loaded by running module list to check that PrgEnv-nvhpc is in the list.

Using LLVM

To use the LLVM module, load the following.
module load mpiwrappers/cray-mpich-llvm
module load cudatoolkit-standalone

See the the LLVM compiling page here for more information.

Using PrgEnv-gnu

To switch from PrgEnv-nvhpc to PrgEnv-gnu you can run:

module switch PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-gnu

The gcc/gfortran on Polaris was not built with GPU support. To use OpenMP on the CPU, you need to unload craype-accel-nvidia80:

module unload craype-accel-nvidia80

Using PrgEnv-cray

To switch from PrgEnv-nvhpc to PrgEnv-cray you can run:

module switch PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-cray

To use OpenMP on the CPU only, also unload craype-accel-nvidia80:

module unload craype-accel-nvidia80

To use OpenMP on the GPU, load cudatoolkit-standalone, although this is not recommended at the moment.
module load cudatoolkit-standalone

<DOCUMENT>VisIt on Polaris

Getting Started

The latest VisIt versions installed on Polaris are 3.3.3 and 3.4.0.

Please note that at the time of this writing VisIt version 3.4.0 does not yet have a client for Mac available.

Follow these steps to install VisIt on your local machine:

Download and install VisIt for your local platform (MacOS, Windows, Linux). The version you download must match the server version installed on Polaris. Use this page

Download the Polaris host profile for VisIt (you may need to right-click and choose ""Save link as..."" or ""Save target as..."")

Copy this file to a file called ~/.visit/hosts/host_anl_polaris.xml on Mac or Linux. [ We need to also specify this path for for Windows]

Note: VisIt allows the user to download host profiles for ANL, but all these settings are outdated. We are working with the VisIt developers to update the ANL host list.

Additional information for using VisIt in client/server mode here

Running VisIt

Start up VisIt on your local machine

Click File -> Open File and choose ""ANL Polaris"" from the ""Host"" dropdown

You'll be prompted for your password; enter your ALCF authenticator app response

When you open a selected file, it will launch a job on Polaris
You will need to specify the ""Bank"" (Project) to use when VisIt submits jobs to the queue on Polaris. Specify a project in the Options box.
If your environment doesn't get sourced correctly with non-interactive SSH, you can set the default project to use under Options -> Host profiles

<DOCUMENT>Note: that the particles.000* is still visible.

Unhide the particles.000*data: click Eye icon

Select particles.000*data: click on name

Filters->Alphabetical->Glyph or click on the Glyph icon from the menu bar

Glyph Type: Sphere

Radius:. 0.15

Orient: Unchecked

Scale Mode: off

Set Scale Factor: 1 - Edit: Checked

Maximum Number of Points: 3000

Mask Points: Checked

Random Mode: Unchecked

Click the Apply button

Since our goal was to unclutter the display, let's hide the particles.000*by toggling them off, by clicking on the Eye icon next to it in the Pipeline Browser

Let's also switch to the Display tab in the Object Inspector, with Glyph1 selected, and change the Color by value to GlyphVector. Since the GlyphVector value is based on the velocity. We can Edit Color Map...and choose the same Blue to Red Rainbow preset that we previously chose for velocity

12. Enter: Red Blood Cells

Now let's add in both of the other data sets, which are polygonal meshes which make up Red Blood Cells (RBCs).

These two data sets are essentially the same kind of data, so we can apply the same filters and make the same types of representation changes to each of them. However, some of the RBCs are marked by the simulation that generated them as healthy (rbc.000) and some of them are marked as diseased (bad_rbc.000).

Unhide the rbc.000 and bad_rbc.000 data sets by clicking the Eye icon next to each of them to make them visible

13. Using Color to Differentiate Data

To enable us to distinguish these two types of data from one other, we can vary their representations.

One way to do this is by setting the color of the two data sets to different colors. Repeat this process for each of rbc.000 and bad_rbc.000, picking different colors.

Select one of the rbc data sets in the Pipeline Browser

Go to the Displaytab in the Object Inspector

In the Color by:dropdown select Solid Color

Click on the Set Solid Color... button

Select a color from the Select Colordialog that appears</DOCUMENT>

oneAPI Math Kernel Library (oneMKL) Interfaces

oneMKL Interfaces is an open-source implementation of the oneMKL Data Parallel C++ (DPC++) interface according to the oneMKL specification. It works with multiple devices (backends) using device-specific libraries underneath.

oneMKL is part of oneAPI. Various backend supported are shown below. More Information here.

Context: <DOCUMENT>Known Issues

This is a collection of known issues that have been encountered on Polaris. Documentation will be updated as issues are resolved. Users are encouraged to email support@alcf.anl.gov to report issues.

Submitting Jobs

For batch job submissions, if the parameters within your submission script do not meet the parameters of any of the execution queues (small, ..., backfill-large) you might not receive the ""Job submission"" error on the command line at all, and the job will never appear in history qstat -xu <username> (current bug in PBS). E.g. if a user submits a script to the prod routing queue requesting 10 nodes for 24 hours, exceeding ""Time Max"" of 6 hrs of the small execution queue (which handles jobs with 10-24 nodes), then it may behave as if the job was never submitted.

Job scripts are copied to temporary locations after qsub and any changes to the original script while the job is queued will not be reflected in the copied script. Furthermore, qalter requires -A <allocation name> when changing job properties. Currently, there is a request for a qalter-like command to trigger a re-copy of the original script to the temporary location.

<DOCUMENT>JAX

JAX is another popular python package for accelerated computing.  JAX is built on XLA (the same XLA TensorFlow uses) as well as AutoGrad, and additionally has acceleration tools that operate on functions such as vmap, jit, etc.  JAX is not as widespread in machine learning as TensorFlow and PyTorch for traditional models (Computer Vision, Language Models) though it is quickly gaining promienence.  JAX is very powerful when a program needs non-traditional autodifferentiation or vectorizatoin, such as: forward-mode AD, higher order derivatives, Jacobians, Hessians, or any combination of the above.  Users of JAX on Polaris are encouraged to read the user documentation in detail, particularly the details about pure-functional programming, no in-place operations, and the common mistakes in writing functions for the @jit decorator.

JAX on Polaris

JAX is installed on Polaris via the conda module, available with:
bash
module load conda; conda activate

Then, you can load JAX in python as usual (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):

```python

import jax
jax.version
'0.3.15'

```

Notes on JAX 0.3.15

On Polaris, due to a bug, an environment variable must be set to use JAX on GPUs.  The following code will crash:
python
import jax.numpy as numpy
a = numpy.zeros(1000)
outputting an error that looks like:
python
jaxlib.xla_extension.XlaRuntimeError: UNKNOWN: no kernel image is available for execution on the device

You can fix this by setting an environment variable:
bash
export XLA_FLAGS=""--xla_gpu_force_compilation_parallelism=1""

Scaling JAX to multiple GPUs and multiple Nodes

Jax has intrinsic scaling tools to use multiple GPUs on a single node, via the pmap function.  If this is sufficient for your needs, excellent.  If not, another alternative is to use the newer package mpi4jax.</DOCUMENT>

DeepSpeed pre-installed. Instructions
for using / cloning the base environment can be found here.

A batch submission script for the following example is available
here.

We describe below the steps needed to get started with DeepSpeed on Polaris.

We focus on the cifar example provided in the

   spack-pe-gnu/0.6.1

Note that spack-pe-base and spack-pe-gnu are metamodules which contain
further software offerings. See the Spack section below for details.

Spack

We have newly installed Spack deployments in /soft. Spack is an HPC-oriented
package manager which ALCF uses to install software for the user environment.
However, no knowledge of Spack is necessary to use these software offerings. All
ALCF-managed software is accessible to users via modules.

The base suite of software tools and libraries can be accessed by loading the
spack-pe-base module. This adds a path to $MODULEPATH which contains
numerous modules.

For example, to load cmake starting from the default environment, a user
should run the following commands:
module use /soft/modulefiles
module load spack-pe-base
module load cmake
Other modules in spack-pe-base can be browsed by running module avail or
module --show-hidden avail. The latter shows hidden modules which are
installed as dependencies of the un-hidden modules.

In addition to the base stack, a suite of higher-level libraries are installed
in the spack-pe-gnu module. These are built with and are dependent on
PrgEnv-gnu. A PrgEnv-nvidia-compatible stack will be available in the
future.

Note that not all software is installed through Spack; many applications and
libraries are installed as standalone packages in /soft. Users are encouraged
to browse the available modules with module avail to see what software is
installed on the system.

Context: <DOCUMENT>Compilers provided by Cray Programming Environments

The default programming environment on Polaris is currently NVHPC. The GNU compilers are available via another programming environment. The following sequence of module commands can be used to switch to the GNU programming environment (gcc, g++, gfortran) and also have NVIDIA compilers available in your path.

module swap PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-gnu
module load nvhpc-mixed

The compilers invoked by the Cray MPI wrappers are listed for each programming environment in the following table.

module C C++ Fortran MPI Compiler Wrapper cc CC ftn PrgEnv-nvhpc nvc nvc++ nvfortran PrgEnv-gnu gcc g++ gfortran

Note, while gcc and g++ may be available in the default environment, the PrgEnv-gnu module is needed to provide gfortran.

Additional Compilers Provided by ALCF

The ALCF additionally provides compilers to enable the OpenMP and SYCL programming models for GPUs viaLLVM as documented here

Additional documentation for using compilers is available on the respective programming model pages: OpenMP and SYCL.

Linking

Dynamic linking of libraries is currently the default on Polaris. The Cray MPI wrappers will handle this automatically.

Notes on Default Modules

craype-x86-rome: While the Polaris compute nodes currently have Milan CPUs, this module is loaded by default to avoid the craype-x86-milan module from adding a zen3 target not supported in the default nvhpc/21.9 compilers. The craype-x86-milan module is expected to be made default once a newer nvhpc version (e.g. 22.5) is made the default.

craype-accel-nvidia80: This module adds compiler flags to enable GPU acceleration for NVHPC compilers along with gpu-enabled MPI libraries as it is assumed that the majority of applications to be compiled on Polaris will target the GPUs for acceleration. Users building cpu-only applications may find it useful to unload this module to silence ""gpu code generation"" warnings.

export XLA_FLAGS=""--xla_gpu_force_compilation_parallelism=1""

Scaling JAX to multiple GPUs and multiple Nodes

Jax has intrinsic scaling tools to use multiple GPUs on a single node, via the pmap function.  If this is sufficient for your needs, excellent.  If not, another alternative is to use the newer package mpi4jax.</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Building on Polaris

The following table shows what compiler and flags to use with which PrgEnv:

module compiler flags PrgEnv-nvhpc cc/CC/ftn (nvc/nvc++/nvfortran) -mp=gpu -gpu=cc80 llvm mpicc/mpicxx (clang/clang++) -fopenmp -fopenmp-targets=nvptx64-nvidia-cuda PrgEnv-gnu cc/CC/ftn (gcc/g++/gfortran) -fopenmp PrgEnv-cray cc/CC/ftn -fopenmp

For example to compile a simple code hello.cpp:

For PrgEnv-nvhpc, after loading the modules as discussed above we would use:

CC -mp=gpu -gpu=cc80 hello.cpp
ftn -mp=gpu -gpu=cc80 hello.F90

For LLVM, after loading the modules as discussed above:

mpicxx -fopenmp -fopenmp-targets=nvptx64-nvidia-cuda hello.cpp

For PrgEnv-gnu, after loading the modules as discussed above we would use:

CC -fopenmp hello.cpp
ftn -fopenmp hello.F90

For PrgEnv-cray, after loading the modules as discussed above we would use:

CC -fopenmp hello.cpp
ftn -fopenmp hello.F90

Running on Polaris

To run, you can run the produced executable or with mpiexec in a job script, and then submit the script to the Polaris queue, like:

```
$ cat submit.sh

!/bin/sh

PBS -l select=1:system=polaris

PBS -l walltime=0:30:00

PBS -q debug

PBS -A Catalyst

PBS -l filesystems=home:eagle

cd ${PBS_O_WORKDIR}
 mpiexec -n 1 ./executable
$ # submit to the queue:
$ qsub -l select=1:system=polaris -l walltime=0:30:00 -l filesystems=home:eagle -q debug -A Catalyst ./submit.sh
```

In the above, having the PBS options in the script and on the command line is redundant, but we put it there to show both ways of launching. This submits the script to one node in the debug queue on Polaris, requesting 30 min and the eagle and home filesystems. It will charge project Catalyst for the time.

More details for setting up the job script are in Job Scheduling and Execution section.

Example

```
$ cat hello.cpp

include

int main( int argv, char** argc ) {

printf( ""Number of devices: %d\n"", omp_get_num_devices() );</DOCUMENT>

Spack

We have newly installed Spack deployments in /soft. Spack is an HPC-oriented
package manager which ALCF uses to install software for the user environment.
However, no knowledge of Spack is necessary to use these software offerings. All
ALCF-managed software is accessible to users via modules.

The base suite of software tools and libraries can be accessed by loading the
spack-pe-base module. This adds a path to $MODULEPATH which contains
numerous modules.

For example, to load cmake starting from the default environment, a user
should run the following commands:
module use /soft/modulefiles
module load spack-pe-base
module load cmake
Other modules in spack-pe-base can be browsed by running module avail or
module --show-hidden avail. The latter shows hidden modules which are
installed as dependencies of the un-hidden modules.

In addition to the base stack, a suite of higher-level libraries are installed
in the spack-pe-gnu module. These are built with and are dependent on
PrgEnv-gnu. A PrgEnv-nvidia-compatible stack will be available in the
future.

Note that not all software is installed through Spack; many applications and
libraries are installed as standalone packages in /soft. Users are encouraged
to browse the available modules with module avail to see what software is
installed on the system.

What is VASP?

The Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) is a software package for performing electronic structure calculations with periodic boundary conditions. It is most commonly used that to perform density functional theory (DFT) calculations in a planewave basis using the projector augemented wave (PAW) method. A more complete description of VASP can be found here:
https://www.vasp.at

Using VASP at ALCF

VASP is commercial software. Access to binaries compiled by ALCF can only be accessed after the user requesting access has been verified to be on the VASP license by an official VASP license distributor.

To access the VASP binary at ALCF, please email the details listed directly below to support@alcf.anl.gov. It can take up to 5 - 10 business days to verify a VASP license.

Information to provide:
- User’s full name:
- User’s ALCF username:
- Name of organization that purchased the VASP license:
- Principal investigator who is the POC for the VASP license:
- VASP license number:
- Version of VASP requested (VASP5, VASP6):

VASP support policy

ALCF compiles the latest release of VASP on a per request basis. We do not offer support for compiling customized versions of VASP with plugins. We are able to provide Makefiles and step-by-step build instructions to users with a verified VASP license. 
Support for scientific runs that encounter performance or numerical issues should be directed to the official VASP support mailing list or the VASP user forum. Limited support is available for fatal errors encountered at run time.

How to obtain the code

The VASP souce can only be obtained by an official license reseller of VASP. This is either the University of Vienna or Material Designs, Inc.

<DOCUMENT>Containers on Polaris

Polaris, powered by NVIDIA A100 GPUs, benefits from container-based workloads for seamless compatibility across NVIDIA systems. This guide details the use of containers on Polaris, including custom container creation, large-scale execution, and common pitfalls.

Apptainer Setup

Polaris employs Apptainer (formerly known as Singularity) for container management. To set up Apptainer, run:

bash
module use /soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/install/modulefiles/Core
module load apptainer
apptainer version #1.2.2

The Apptainer version on Polaris is 1.2.2. Detailed user documentation is available here

Building from Docker or Argonne GitHub Container Registry

Containers on Polaris can be built by writing Dockerfiles on a local machine and then publish the container to DockerHub, or by directly building them on ALCF compute node by writing an Apptainer recipe file. If you prefer to use existing containers, you can pull them from various registries like DockerHub and run them on Polaris.

Since Docker requires root privileges, which users do not have on Polaris, existing Docker containers must be converted to Apptainer. To build a Docker-based container on Polaris, use the following as an example:</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>```

Special notes for Polaris

On Polaris, there is a known bug where python applications launched with mpi and that use fork to spawn processes can sometimes have unexplaned hangs.  For this reason, it is recommended to use start_method=""spawn"" on Polaris when using the MpiExecLauncher as is shown in the example config above.  Alternatively, another solution is to use the GNUParallelLauncher which uses GNU Parallel to spawn processes.  GNU Parallel can be loaded in your environment with the command module load gnu-parallel.  Both of these approaches will circumvent the hang issue from using fork.

Updates

For parsl versions after July 2023, the address passed in the HighThroughputExecutor needs to be set to address = address_by_interface(""bond0"").  With parsl versions prior to July 2023, it was recommended to use address = address_by_hostname() on Polaris, but with later versions this will not work on Polaris (or any other machine).</DOCUMENT>

Changes to Memory Limits on Login Nodes

Memory limits were lowered on the logins due to resource contention to 8GB of memory, and 8 cores per user. 
This might result in error messages indicating abnormal process termination for user processes run on logins.

Examples of the error messages people might see are:

nvcc error   : 'cudafe++' died due to signal 9 (Kill signal)

g++-12: fatal error: Killed signal terminated program cc1plus

These errors are likely due to exhausting the per-user resources on a login node as each user is allocated 8 cores and 8GB memory.
To avoid this you can either:

Reduce the parallelism of your compile, such as using -j or -j4 flags

Request a debug node and run your compile there where you will have the full resources of the node at your disposal</DOCUMENT>

<DOCUMENT>ParaView on Polaris

The recommended way of running ParaView on Polaris is in client/server mode. This consists of running the ParaView client on your local resource, and the ParaView server on the Polaris compute nodes. The ParaView client needs to first be installed on your local resource, and needs to match the version that you run on Polaris.

There are multiple versions of ParaView installed on Polaris. To find the versions of ParaView currently available on Polaris run the following command on a login node: 
module use /soft/modulefiles
module avail paraview

Binary and source packages of the ParaView client for Linux, MacOS, and Windows are available from the ParaView Download Page.

Connecting to the ParaView server on Polaris

This section describes how to launch the ParaView server on Polaris from a local ParaView client.

Start ParaView Client

First, launch the ParaView client on your local resource. You will need to configure some server settings in the client. This initial set up should only need to be done once, and can be reused each time you want to run ParaView on Polaris.

Server Configuration

1. Select Connect

From the ParaView client choose to connect to a server by either clicking on the ""Connect"" icon in the menu bar

or selecting File->Connect from the main menu

2. Set Up Servers (first time only)

The first time you want to run a server on Polaris and have it connect to your local ParaView client, you will need to set up a Server. Once this server is set up, you can reuse it each time you run the ParaView client with the ParaView server on Polaris.

Kitware, the developers of ParaView, maintain a database of server configurations which you can retrieve through the ParaView client. In the File->Connect menu press the button named ""Fetch Servers"" and select POLARIS@ANL. Windows users should select ""windows to POLARIS@ANL"". Press ""Import Selected""

3. Use ParaView</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Controlling Where Your Job Runs

If you wish to have your job run on specific nodes form your select like this: -l select=1:vnode=<node name1>+1:vnode=<node name2>... . Obviously, that gets tedious for large jobs.

If you want to control the location of a few nodes, for example 2 out of 64, but the rest don't matter, you can do something like this: -l select=1:vnode=<node name1>+1:vnode=<node name2>+62:system=foo

Every node has a PBS resource called tier0 with a rack identifier and tier1 with a dragonfly group identifieer.  If you want all your nodes grouped in a rack, you can add the group specifier -l select=8:system=foo,place=scatter:group=tier0.  If you wanted everything in the same dragonfly group, replace tier0 with tier1.  Note that you have to also explicitly specify the place when you use group.  If you wanted a specific rack or dragonfly group instead of any of them, you are back to the select: -l select 10:tier0=x3001-g0.

Network: Rack and Dragonfly Group Mappings

Racks contain (7) 6U chassis; each chassis has 2 nodes for 14 nodes per rack

The hostnames are of the form xRRPPc0sUUb[0|1]n0 where:
RR is the row {30, 31, 32}
PP is the position in the row {30 goes 1-16, 31 and 32 go 1-12}
c is chassis and is always 0
s stands for slot, but in this case is the RU in the rack and values are {1,7,13,19,25,31,37}
b is BMC controller and is 0 or 1 (each node has its own BMC)
n is node, but is always 0 since there is only one node per BMC

So, 16+12+12 = 40 racks * 14 nodes per rack = 560 nodes.

Note that in production group 9 (the last 4 racks) will be the designated on-demand racks

The management racks are x3000 and X3100 and are dragonfly group 10

The TDS rack is x3200 and is dragonfly group 11</DOCUMENT>

Since our goal was to unclutter the display, let's hide the particles.000*by toggling them off, by clicking on the Eye icon next to it in the Pipeline Browser

Let's also switch to the Display tab in the Object Inspector, with Glyph1 selected, and change the Color by value to GlyphVector. Since the GlyphVector value is based on the velocity. We can Edit Color Map...and choose the same Blue to Red Rainbow preset that we previously chose for velocity

12. Enter: Red Blood Cells

Now let's add in both of the other data sets, which are polygonal meshes which make up Red Blood Cells (RBCs).

These two data sets are essentially the same kind of data, so we can apply the same filters and make the same types of representation changes to each of them. However, some of the RBCs are marked by the simulation that generated them as healthy (rbc.000) and some of them are marked as diseased (bad_rbc.000).

Unhide the rbc.000 and bad_rbc.000 data sets by clicking the Eye icon next to each of them to make them visible

13. Using Color to Differentiate Data

To enable us to distinguish these two types of data from one other, we can vary their representations.

One way to do this is by setting the color of the two data sets to different colors. Repeat this process for each of rbc.000 and bad_rbc.000, picking different colors.

Select one of the rbc data sets in the Pipeline Browser

Go to the Displaytab in the Object Inspector

Changes to Memory Limits on Login Nodes

Memory limits were lowered on the logins due to resource contention to 8GB of memory, and 8 cores per user. 
This might result in error messages indicating abnormal process termination for user processes run on logins.

Examples of the error messages people might see are:

nvcc error   : 'cudafe++' died due to signal 9 (Kill signal)

g++-12: fatal error: Killed signal terminated program cc1plus

These errors are likely due to exhausting the per-user resources on a login node as each user is allocated 8 cores and 8GB memory.
To avoid this you can either:

Reduce the parallelism of your compile, such as using -j or -j4 flags

Request a debug node and run your compile there where you will have the full resources of the node at your disposal</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Compilers provided by Cray Programming Environments

The default programming environment on Polaris is currently NVHPC. The GNU compilers are available via another programming environment. The following sequence of module commands can be used to switch to the GNU programming environment (gcc, g++, gfortran) and also have NVIDIA compilers available in your path.

module swap PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-gnu
module load nvhpc-mixed

The compilers invoked by the Cray MPI wrappers are listed for each programming environment in the following table.

module C C++ Fortran MPI Compiler Wrapper cc CC ftn PrgEnv-nvhpc nvc nvc++ nvfortran PrgEnv-gnu gcc g++ gfortran

Note, while gcc and g++ may be available in the default environment, the PrgEnv-gnu module is needed to provide gfortran.

Additional Compilers Provided by ALCF

The ALCF additionally provides compilers to enable the OpenMP and SYCL programming models for GPUs viaLLVM as documented here

Additional documentation for using compilers is available on the respective programming model pages: OpenMP and SYCL.

Linking

Dynamic linking of libraries is currently the default on Polaris. The Cray MPI wrappers will handle this automatically.

Notes on Default Modules

craype-x86-rome: While the Polaris compute nodes currently have Milan CPUs, this module is loaded by default to avoid the craype-x86-milan module from adding a zen3 target not supported in the default nvhpc/21.9 compilers. The craype-x86-milan module is expected to be made default once a newer nvhpc version (e.g. 22.5) is made the default.

craype-accel-nvidia80: This module adds compiler flags to enable GPU acceleration for NVHPC compilers along with gpu-enabled MPI libraries as it is assumed that the majority of applications to be compiled on Polaris will target the GPUs for acceleration. Users building cpu-only applications may find it useful to unload this module to silence ""gpu code generation"" warnings.

Mixed C/C++ & Fortran Applications</DOCUMENT>

Introduction

CUDA-GDB is the NVIDIA tool for debugging CUDA applications running on Polaris. CUDA-GDB is an extension to GDB, the GNU Project debugger. The tool provides developers with a mechanism for debugging CUDA applications running on actual hardware. This enables developers to debug applications without the potential variations introduced by simulation and emulation environments.

Step-by-step guide

Debug Compilation

NVCC, the NVIDIA CUDA compiler driver, provides a mechanism for generating the debugging information necessary for CUDA-GDB to work properly. The -g -G option pair must be passed to NVCC when an application is compiled for ease of debugging with CUDA-GDB; for example,
nvcc -g -G foo.cu -o foo
Using this line to compile the CUDA application foo.cu
* forces -O0 compilation, with the exception of very limited dead-code eliminations and register-spilling optimizations.
* makes the compiler include debug information in the executable

Running CUDA-gdb on Polaris compute nodes

Start an interactive job mode on Polaris as follows:

```
$ qsub -I -l select=1 -l walltime=1:00:00

$ cuda-gdb --version

<DOCUMENT>Use TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.  Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.  When possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention.

Use XLA compilation on your code.  XLA is the Accelerated Linear Algebra library that is available in tensorFlow and critical in software like JAX.  XLA will compile a tf.Graph object, generated with tf.function or similar, and perform optimizations like operation-fusion.  XLA can give impressive performance boosts with almost no user changes except to set an environment variable TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2.  If your code is complex, or has dynamically sized tensors (tensors where the shape changes every iteration), XLA can be detrimental: the overhead for compiling functions can be large enough to mitigate performance improvements.  XLA is particularly powerful when combined with reduced precision, yielding speedups > 100% in some models.

Multi-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up

TensorFlow is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with tensorFlow has been seen with horovod in particular.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation.  Some polaris specific details that may be helpful to you:

CPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.  In particular, we encourage users to try their scaling measurements with the following settings:

Set the environment variable NCCL_COLLNET_ENABLE=1</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>NVIDIA Compilers on Polaris

The NVIDIA compilers (nvc, nvc++, nvcc, and nvfortran) are available on Polaris via the PrgEnv-nvhpc and nvhpc modules. There is currently a PrgEnv-nvidia module available, but that will soon be deprecated in Cray's PE, thus it is not recommend for use.

The Cray compiler wrappers map to NVIDIA compilers as follows.

cc -> nvc
CC -> nvc++
ftn -> nvfortran

Users are encouraged to look through NVIDIA's documentation for the NVHPC SDK and specific information on the compilers, tools, and libraries.

Notes on NVIDIA Compilers

PGI compilers

The NVIDIA programming environments makes available compilers from the NVIDIA HPC SDK. While the PGI compilers are available in this programming environment, it should be noted they are actually symlinks to the corresponding NVIDIA compilers.
pgcc -> nvc
pgc++ -> nvc++
pgf90 -> nvfortran
pgfortran -> nvfortran
While nvcc is the traditional CUDA C and CUDA C++ compiler for NVIDIA GPUs, the nvc, nvc++, and nvfortran compilers additionally target CPUs.

NVHPC SDK Directory Structure

Users migrating from CUDA toolkits to the NVHPC SDK may find it beneficial to review the directory structure of the hpc-sdk directory to find the location of commonly used libraries (including math libraries for the CPU). With the PrgEnv-nvhpc module loaded, the NVIDIA_PATH environment variable can be used to locate the path to various NVIDIA tools, libraries, and examples.

compiler/bin - cuda-gdb, ncu, nsys, ...

examples - CUDA-Fortran, OpenMP, ...

comm_libs - nccl, nvshmem, ...

Differences between nvcc and nvc/nvc++</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>['Compiling and Linking Overview on Polaris\n\nCompiling on Polaris Login and Compute Nodes\n\nIf your build system does not require GPUs for the build process, as is usually the case, compilation of GPU-accelerated codes is generally expected to work well on the Polaris login nodes. If your build system does require GPUs, you cannot yet compile on the Polaris login nodes, as they do not currently have GPUs installed. You may in this case compile your applications on the Polaris compute nodes. Do this by submitting an interactive single-node job, or running your build system in a batch job.\n\nHome File System\n\nIs it helpful to realize that there is a single HOME filesystem for users that can be accessed from the login and computes of each production resource at ALCF. Thus, users should be mindful of modifications to their environments (e.g. .bashrc) that may cause issues to arise due to differences between the systems.\n\nCray Programming Environment\n\nThe Cray Programming Environment (PE) uses three compiler wrappers for building software.

Note: Please be aware that jobs in the preemptable queue can be killed at any time if jobs are submitted to the demand queue.
Jobs in the demand queue take priority over jobs in the preemptable queue.
This means jobs in the preemptable queue may be preempted (killed without any warning) if there are jobs in the demand queue.
Unfortunately, there's always an inherent risk of jobs being killed when using the preemptable queue. 
Please use the following command to view details of a queue: qstat -Qf <queuename>

To make your job re-runable add the following PBS directive: #PBS -r y This will ensure your job will restart once the demand job is complete.

Note: The debug queue has 8 exclusively dedicated nodes.
If there are free nodes in production, then debug jobs can take another 16 nodes for a total of 24.

the new Polaris NVIDIA GPU hardware driver (CUDA 12.2) and to use the latest MPI, NCCL, cuDNN, TensorRT, etc. libraries. 
PyTorch 2.3.0 and TensorFlow 2.16.1 are now available as part of this module.

To use the new environment, type:
module use /soft/modulefiles 
module load conda; conda activate

/soft refresh and default $MODULEPATH change

Due to the new system software stack, /soft has been purged to allow for
software to be rebuilt. In addition, /soft/modulefiles is no longer in the

Introduction

NVIDIA® Nsight™ Systems provides developers a system-wide visualization of an applications performance. Developers can optimize bottlenecks to scale efficiently across any number or size of CPUs and GPUs on Polaris. For further optimizations to compute kernels developers should use Nsight Compute.

The NVIDIA Nsight Compute is an interactive kernel profiler for CUDA applications. It provides detailed performance metrics and API debugging via a user interface and command line tool.

In addition, the baseline feature of this tool allows users to compare results within the tool. NVIDIA Nsight Compute provides a customizable and data-driven user interface,  metric collection, and can be extended with analysis scripts for post-processing results.

<DOCUMENT>['Example Programs and Makefiles for Polaris\n\nSeveral simple examples of building CPU and GPU-enabled codes on Polaris are available in the ALCF GettingStart repo for several programming models. If build your application is problematic for some reason (e.g. absence of a GPU), then users are encouraged to build and test applications directly on one of the Polaris compute nodes via an interactive job. The discussion below makes use of the NVHPC compilers in the default environment as illustrative examples. Similar examples for other compilers on Polaris are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo.\n\nCPU MPI+OpenMP Example\n\nOne of the first useful tasks with any new machine, scheduler, and job launcher is to ensure one is binding MPI ranks and OpenMP threads to the host cpu as intended. A simple HelloWorld MPI+OpenMP example is available here to get started with.\n\nThe application can be straightforwardly compiled using the Cray compiler wrappers.\nCC -fopenmp main.cpp -o hello_affinity\n\nThe executable hello_affinity can then be launched in a job script (or directly in shell of interactive job) using mpiexec as discussed here.\n\n```\n\n!/bin/sh\n\nPBS -l select=1:system=polaris\n\nPBS -l place=scatter\n\nPBS -l walltime=0:30:00\n\nPBS -l filesystems=home\n\nMPI example w/ 16 MPI ranks per node spread evenly across cores\n\nNNODES=wc -l < $PBS_NODEFILE\nNRANKS_PER_NODE=16\nNDEPTH=4\nNTHREADS=1\n\nNTOTRANKS=$(( NNODES * NRANKS_PER_NODE ))\necho ""NUM_OF_NODES= ${NNODES} TOTAL_NUM_RANKS= ${NTOTRANKS} RANKS_PER_NODE= ${NRANKS_PER_NODE} THREADS_PER_RANK= ${NTHREADS}""\n\nmpiexec -n ${NTOTRANKS} --ppn ${NRANKS_PER_NODE} --depth=${NDEPTH} --cpu-bind depth ./hello_affinity\n```\n\nCUDA\n\nSeveral variants of C/C++ and Fortran CUDA examples are available here that include MPI and multi-gpu examples.\n\nOne can use the Cray compiler wrappers to compile GPU-enabled applications as well.

Interactive Jobs on Compute Nodes

Here is how to submit an interactive job to, for example, edit/build/test an application Polaris compute nodes:
qsub -I -l select=1 -l filesystems=home:eagle -l walltime=1:00:00 -q debug -A <project_name>

This command requests 1 node for a period of 1 hour in the debug queue, requiring access to the /home and eagle filesystems. After waiting in the queue for a node to become available, a shell prompt on a compute node will appear. You may then start building applications and testing gpu affinity scripts on the compute node.

NOTE: If you want to ssh or scp to one of your assigned compute nodes you will need to make sure your $HOME directory and your $HOME/.ssh directory permissions are both set to 700.

Julia Project Environment

The Julia built-in package manager allows you to create a project and enable
project-specific dependencies. Julia manages packages in the Julia depot located
by default in ~/.julia. However, that NFS filesystem is not meant for
high-speed access. Therefore, this Julia depot folder should be located on a
fast filesystem of your choice (grand, eagle). The Julia depot directory is
set via the environment variable JULIA_DEPOT_PATH. For example, you can set
the Julia depot to a directory on Polaris grand filesystem by adding the following line
to your ~/.bashrc file:

bash
export JULIA_DEPOT_PATH=/grand/$PROJECT/$USER/julia_depot

Programming Julia on Polaris

There are three key components to using Julia for large-scale computations:

MPI support through MPI.jl

GPU support through CUDA.jl

HDF5 support through HDF5.jl

In addition, we recommend VSCode with the Julia
extension for a modern IDE experience, together
with the ssh-remote extension for remote interactive development.

MPI Support

MPI support is provided through the MPI.jl.
bash
$ julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(""MPI"")'
This will install the MPI.jl package and default MPI prebuilt binaries provided by an artifact. For on-node debugging purposes the default artifact is sufficient. However, for large-scale computations, it is important to use the Cray MPICH installed on Polaris. As of MPI.jl v0.20 this is handled through MPIPrefences.jl.
$ julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(""MPIPreferences"")'
$ julia --project -e 'using MPIPreferences; MPIPreferences.use_system_binary(vendor=""cray"")'

The vendor=""cray"" option is important if you intend to use gpu-aware MPI in your applications.

Check that the correct MPI library is targeted with Julia.
```
julia --project -e 'using MPI; MPI.versioninfo()'
MPIPreferences:
  binary:  system
  abi:     MPICH
  libmpi:  libmpi_nvidia.so
  mpiexec: mpiexec</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Containers on Polaris

Polaris, powered by NVIDIA A100 GPUs, benefits from container-based workloads for seamless compatibility across NVIDIA systems. This guide details the use of containers on Polaris, including custom container creation, large-scale execution, and common pitfalls.

Apptainer Setup

Polaris employs Apptainer (formerly known as Singularity) for container management. To set up Apptainer, run:

bash
module use /soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/install/modulefiles/Core
module load apptainer
apptainer version #1.2.2

The Apptainer version on Polaris is 1.2.2. Detailed user documentation is available here

Building from Docker or Argonne GitHub Container Registry

Containers on Polaris can be built by writing Dockerfiles on a local machine and then publish the container to DockerHub, or by directly building them on ALCF compute node by writing an Apptainer recipe file. If you prefer to use existing containers, you can pull them from various registries like DockerHub and run them on Polaris.

Since Docker requires root privileges, which users do not have on Polaris, existing Docker containers must be converted to Apptainer. To build a Docker-based container on Polaris, use the following as an example:</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>set(top_SRCS
  ${buildExample_SOURCE_DIR}/example1.cpp)

set(SOURCE_FILES ${top_SRCS})

add_executable(example1_sycl_aot ${SOURCE_FILES})
target_link_libraries(example1_sycl_aot Kokkos::kokkoscore)
target_include_directories(example1_sycl_aot PUBLIC ${buildExample_SOURCE_DIR})
```

Configure and build it like this:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=CC -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=cc ..
make

Building a Kokkos Application Using make

Here's an example Makefile:

```

KOKKOS_HOME set via:

module load kokkos

You can look at the first lines of $KOKKOS_HOME/KokkosConfigCommon.cmake to

see the flags used in cmake configuration of the kokkos library build. The

default Kokkos module on Polaris was built with PrgEnv-nvhpc and includes

Serial, OpenMP (threads) and CUDA backends. So you should have that

environment module loaded and include compiler flags for cuda and openmp:

Cray MPI wrapper for C++ and C compilers:

CXX=CC
CC=cc

CPPFLAGS=-cuda -fopenmp
LDFLAGS=

LDFLAGS=$(CPPFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS)
LDLIBS=-L$(KOKKOS_HOME)/lib64 -lkokkoscore -lkokkossimd -lpthread

SRCS=example1.cpp
OBJS=$(subst .cpp,.o,$(SRCS))

all: example1_polaris

example1_polaris: $(OBJS)
        $(CXX) $(LDFLAGS) -o example1_polaris $(OBJS) $(LDLIBS)

example1.o: example1.cpp

clean:
        rm -f $(OBJS)

distclean: clean
        rm -f example1_polaris
```

Configuring Your Own Kokkos Build on Polaris

Here are recommended environment settings and configuration to build your own
kokkos libraries on Polaris:

Environment

To match what was done in the centrally-built kokkos associated with the
modules discussed above, use the programming environment
PrgEnv-gnu, and use the Cray wrapper CC as the C++ compiler. You'll also
need to explicitly load the Cuda toolkit version 12.2.91 as shown:</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>https://www.alcf.anl.gov/support/user-guides/polaris/hardware-overview/machine-overview/index.html

gpu=$((${num_gpus} - 1 - ${PMI_LOCAL_RANK} % ${num_gpus}))
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=$gpu
echo “RANK= ${PMI_RANK} LOCAL_RANK= ${PMI_LOCAL_RANK} gpu= ${gpu}”
exec ""$@""
This script can be placed just before the executable in the `mpiexec` command like so.bash
mpiexec -n ${NTOTRANKS} --ppn ${NRANKS_PER_NODE} --depth=${NDEPTH} --cpu-bind depth ./set_affinity_gpu_polaris.sh ./hello_affinity
```
Users with different needs, such as assigning multiple GPUs per MPI rank, can modify the above script to suit their needs.

Interactive Jobs on Compute Nodes

Here is how to submit an interactive job to, for example, edit/build/test an application Polaris compute nodes:
qsub -I -l select=1 -l filesystems=home:eagle -l walltime=1:00:00 -q debug -A <project_name>

This command requests 1 node for a period of 1 hour in the debug queue, requiring access to the /home and eagle filesystems. After waiting in the queue for a node to become available, a shell prompt on a compute node will appear. You may then start building applications and testing gpu affinity scripts on the compute node.

NOTE: If you want to ssh or scp to one of your assigned compute nodes you will need to make sure your $HOME directory and your $HOME/.ssh directory permissions are both set to 700.

Context: <DOCUMENT>Controlling Where Your Job Runs

If you wish to have your job run on specific nodes form your select like this: -l select=1:vnode=<node name1>+1:vnode=<node name2>... . Obviously, that gets tedious for large jobs.

If you want to control the location of a few nodes, for example 2 out of 64, but the rest don't matter, you can do something like this: -l select=1:vnode=<node name1>+1:vnode=<node name2>+62:system=foo

Every node has a PBS resource called tier0 with a rack identifier and tier1 with a dragonfly group identifieer.  If you want all your nodes grouped in a rack, you can add the group specifier -l select=8:system=foo,place=scatter:group=tier0.  If you wanted everything in the same dragonfly group, replace tier0 with tier1.  Note that you have to also explicitly specify the place when you use group.  If you wanted a specific rack or dragonfly group instead of any of them, you are back to the select: -l select 10:tier0=x3001-g0.

Network: Rack and Dragonfly Group Mappings

Racks contain (7) 6U chassis; each chassis has 2 nodes for 14 nodes per rack

The hostnames are of the form xRRPPc0sUUb[0|1]n0 where:
RR is the row {30, 31, 32}
PP is the position in the row {30 goes 1-16, 31 and 32 go 1-12}
c is chassis and is always 0
s stands for slot, but in this case is the RU in the rack and values are {1,7,13,19,25,31,37}
b is BMC controller and is 0 or 1 (each node has its own BMC)
n is node, but is always 0 since there is only one node per BMC

So, 16+12+12 = 40 racks * 14 nodes per rack = 560 nodes.

Note that in production group 9 (the last 4 racks) will be the designated on-demand racks

The management racks are x3000 and X3100 and are dragonfly group 10

Changes to Memory Limits on Login Nodes

Memory limits were lowered on the logins due to resource contention to 8GB of memory, and 8 cores per user. 
This might result in error messages indicating abnormal process termination for user processes run on logins.

Examples of the error messages people might see are:

nvcc error   : 'cudafe++' died due to signal 9 (Kill signal)

g++-12: fatal error: Killed signal terminated program cc1plus

These errors are likely due to exhausting the per-user resources on a login node as each user is allocated 8 cores and 8GB memory.
To avoid this you can either:

Reduce the parallelism of your compile, such as using -j or -j4 flags

Request a debug node and run your compile there where you will have the full resources of the node at your disposal</DOCUMENT>

<DOCUMENT>Kokkos

Kokkos

Kokkos Core implements a programming model in C++ for writing performance
portable applications targeting all major HPC platforms. For that purpose it
provides abstractions for both parallel execution of code and data
management. Kokkos is designed to target complex node architectures with
N-level memory hierarchies and multiple types of execution resources. It
currently can use Serial and OpenMP (threads) for CPU execution spaces
(""backends"") and CUDA, HIP, SYCL, and OpenMPTarget for GPU execution
spaces. By convention, Kokkos only allows one GPU backend at a time.

Kokkos on Polaris

Following the Polaris upgrade to HPCM
1.10,
the module setup to use the prebuilt Kokkos changed.

The prebuilt Kokkos on polaris includes 3 backends: Serial and OpenMP for CPU
execution and CUDA for GPU execution. To use it, run

module load craype-x86-milan
module load craype-accel-nvidia80
module swap PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-gnu
module use /soft/modulefiles
module load cuda-PrgEnv-nvidia/12.2.91
module load kokkos

This sets the following environment variables, some of which are used by
cmake:

KOKKOS_HOME - path to the lib64/, include/ files installed

LIBRARY_PATH - prepends $KOKKOS_HOME/lib64 to this variable used by cmake

CPATH - prepends $KOKKOS_HOME/include to this variable used by cmake

LD_LIBRARY_PATH - prepends $KOKKOS_HOME/lib64 to this variable

Building a Kokkos Application Using cmake

Add these lines to CMakeLists.txt:

find_package(Kokkos REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(myTarget Kokkos::kokkoscore)

Here is a simple example CMakeLists.txt to compile an example program:

```

<DOCUMENT>Controlling Where Your Job Runs

If you wish to have your job run on specific nodes form your select like this: -l select=1:vnode=<node name1>+1:vnode=<node name2>... . Obviously, that gets tedious for large jobs.

If you want to control the location of a few nodes, for example 2 out of 64, but the rest don't matter, you can do something like this: -l select=1:vnode=<node name1>+1:vnode=<node name2>+62:system=foo

Every node has a PBS resource called tier0 with a rack identifier and tier1 with a dragonfly group identifieer.  If you want all your nodes grouped in a rack, you can add the group specifier -l select=8:system=foo,place=scatter:group=tier0.  If you wanted everything in the same dragonfly group, replace tier0 with tier1.  Note that you have to also explicitly specify the place when you use group.  If you wanted a specific rack or dragonfly group instead of any of them, you are back to the select: -l select 10:tier0=x3001-g0.

Network: Rack and Dragonfly Group Mappings

Racks contain (7) 6U chassis; each chassis has 2 nodes for 14 nodes per rack

The hostnames are of the form xRRPPc0sUUb[0|1]n0 where:
RR is the row {30, 31, 32}
PP is the position in the row {30 goes 1-16, 31 and 32 go 1-12}
c is chassis and is always 0
s stands for slot, but in this case is the RU in the rack and values are {1,7,13,19,25,31,37}
b is BMC controller and is 0 or 1 (each node has its own BMC)
n is node, but is always 0 since there is only one node per BMC

So, 16+12+12 = 40 racks * 14 nodes per rack = 560 nodes.

Note that in production group 9 (the last 4 racks) will be the designated on-demand racks

The management racks are x3000 and X3100 and are dragonfly group 10

The TDS rack is x3200 and is dragonfly group 11</DOCUMENT>

<DOCUMENT>Note 1: You cannot submit to these queues directly, you can only submit to the routing queue ""prod"".

Note 2: All of these queues have a limit of ten (10) jobs running/accruing per-project

Note 3: All of these queues have a limit of one hundred (100) jobs queued (not accruing score) per-project

Note 4: As of January 2023, it is recommended to submit jobs with a maximum node count of 476-486 nodes given current rates of downed nodes (larger jobs may sit in the queue indefinitely).

Running MPI+OpenMP Applications

Once a submitted job is running calculations can be launched on the compute nodes using mpiexec to start an MPI application. Documentation is accessible via man mpiexec and some helpful options follow.

-n total number of MPI ranks

-ppn number of MPI ranks per node

--cpu-bind CPU binding for application

--depth number of cpus per rank (useful with --cpu-bind)

--env set environment variables (--env OMP_NUM_THREADS=2)

--hostfile indicate file with hostnames (the default is --hostfile $PBS_NODEFILE)

A sample submission script with directives is below for a 4-node job with 8 MPI ranks on each node and 8 OpenMP threads per rank. Each hardware thread runs a single OpenMP thread since there are 64 hardware threads on the CPU (2 per core).
You can download and compile hello_affinity from this link.

```bash

!/bin/bash -l

PBS -N AFFINITY

PBS -l select=4:ncpus=256

PBS -l walltime=0:10:00

PBS -q debug-scaling

PBS -A Catalyst  # Replace with your project

NNODES=wc -l < $PBS_NODEFILE
NRANKS=8 # Number of MPI ranks to spawn per node
NDEPTH=8 # Number of hardware threads per rank (i.e. spacing between MPI ranks)
NTHREADS=8 # Number of software threads per rank to launch (i.e. OMP_NUM_THREADS)

NTOTRANKS=$(( NNODES * NRANKS ))

echo ""NUM_OF_NODES= ${NNODES} TOTAL_NUM_RANKS= ${NTOTRANKS} RANKS_PER_NODE= ${NRANKS} THREADS_PER_RANK= ${NTHREADS}""

Change the directory to work directory, which is the directory you submit the job.</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Notes

SmartSim workflows, such as online training, often require launching multiple MPI applications on the same set of nodes. On Polaris, the MPICH_OFI_CXI_PID_BASE=0 must be exported before the first call to mpiexec, and then incremented by 1 and re-exported before each successive call. This is done with the SmartSim API by adding env_vars={'MPICH_OFI_CXI_PID_BASE':str(0)} to the PalsMpiexecSettings() API.</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>VisIt on Polaris

Getting Started

The latest VisIt versions installed on Polaris are 3.3.3 and 3.4.0.

Please note that at the time of this writing VisIt version 3.4.0 does not yet have a client for Mac available.

Follow these steps to install VisIt on your local machine:

Download and install VisIt for your local platform (MacOS, Windows, Linux). The version you download must match the server version installed on Polaris. Use this page

Download the Polaris host profile for VisIt (you may need to right-click and choose ""Save link as..."" or ""Save target as..."")

Copy this file to a file called ~/.visit/hosts/host_anl_polaris.xml on Mac or Linux. [ We need to also specify this path for for Windows]

Note: VisIt allows the user to download host profiles for ANL, but all these settings are outdated. We are working with the VisIt developers to update the ANL host list.

Additional information for using VisIt in client/server mode here

Running VisIt

Start up VisIt on your local machine

Click File -> Open File and choose ""ANL Polaris"" from the ""Host"" dropdown

You'll be prompted for your password; enter your ALCF authenticator app response

When you open a selected file, it will launch a job on Polaris
You will need to specify the ""Bank"" (Project) to use when VisIt submits jobs to the queue on Polaris. Specify a project in the Options box.
If your environment doesn't get sourced correctly with non-interactive SSH, you can set the default project to use under Options -> Host profiles

<DOCUMENT>Gromacs on Polaris

What is Gromacs?

GROMACS is a versatile package to perform molecular dynamics, i.e. simulate the Newtonian equations of motion for systems with hundreds to millions of particles. It is primarily designed for biochemical molecules like proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids that have a lot of complicated bonded interactions, but since GROMACS is extremely fast at calculating the nonbonded interactions (that usually dominate simulations) many groups are also using it for research on non-biological systems, e.g. polymers.

Using GROMACS at ALCF

ALCF offers assistance with building binaries and compiling instructions for GROMACS. For questions, contact us at support@alcf.anl.gov.

Running Gromacs on Polaris

Prebuilt Gromacs binaries can be found in the directory /soft/applications/Gromacs/gromacs-2022.1.

A sample pbs script follows that will run GROMACS on two nodes, using 4 MPI ranks per node, and each rank with four OpenMP threads. The PME kernel owns one MPI rank and one GPU per node, while the nonbonded kernel uses 3 MPI ranks and 3 GPUs per node.

<DOCUMENT>Building on Polaris

The following table shows what compiler and flags to use with which PrgEnv:

module compiler flags PrgEnv-nvhpc cc/CC/ftn (nvc/nvc++/nvfortran) -mp=gpu -gpu=cc80 llvm mpicc/mpicxx (clang/clang++) -fopenmp -fopenmp-targets=nvptx64-nvidia-cuda PrgEnv-gnu cc/CC/ftn (gcc/g++/gfortran) -fopenmp PrgEnv-cray cc/CC/ftn -fopenmp

For example to compile a simple code hello.cpp:

For PrgEnv-nvhpc, after loading the modules as discussed above we would use:

CC -mp=gpu -gpu=cc80 hello.cpp
ftn -mp=gpu -gpu=cc80 hello.F90

For LLVM, after loading the modules as discussed above:

mpicxx -fopenmp -fopenmp-targets=nvptx64-nvidia-cuda hello.cpp

For PrgEnv-gnu, after loading the modules as discussed above we would use:

CC -fopenmp hello.cpp
ftn -fopenmp hello.F90

For PrgEnv-cray, after loading the modules as discussed above we would use:

CC -fopenmp hello.cpp
ftn -fopenmp hello.F90

Running on Polaris

To run, you can run the produced executable or with mpiexec in a job script, and then submit the script to the Polaris queue, like:

```
$ cat submit.sh

!/bin/sh

PBS -l select=1:system=polaris

PBS -l walltime=0:30:00

PBS -q debug

PBS -A Catalyst

PBS -l filesystems=home:eagle

cd ${PBS_O_WORKDIR}
 mpiexec -n 1 ./executable
$ # submit to the queue:
$ qsub -l select=1:system=polaris -l walltime=0:30:00 -l filesystems=home:eagle -q debug -A Catalyst ./submit.sh
```

In the above, having the PBS options in the script and on the command line is redundant, but we put it there to show both ways of launching. This submits the script to one node in the debug queue on Polaris, requesting 30 min and the eagle and home filesystems. It will charge project Catalyst for the time.

More details for setting up the job script are in Job Scheduling and Execution section.

$ cat hello.cpp

Context: <DOCUMENT>Containers on Polaris

Polaris, powered by NVIDIA A100 GPUs, benefits from container-based workloads for seamless compatibility across NVIDIA systems. This guide details the use of containers on Polaris, including custom container creation, large-scale execution, and common pitfalls.

Apptainer Setup

Polaris employs Apptainer (formerly known as Singularity) for container management. To set up Apptainer, run:

bash
module use /soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/install/modulefiles/Core
module load apptainer
apptainer version #1.2.2

The Apptainer version on Polaris is 1.2.2. Detailed user documentation is available here

Building from Docker or Argonne GitHub Container Registry

Containers on Polaris can be built by writing Dockerfiles on a local machine and then publish the container to DockerHub, or by directly building them on ALCF compute node by writing an Apptainer recipe file. If you prefer to use existing containers, you can pull them from various registries like DockerHub and run them on Polaris.

Since Docker requires root privileges, which users do not have on Polaris, existing Docker containers must be converted to Apptainer. To build a Docker-based container on Polaris, use the following as an example:</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Known Issues

This is a collection of known issues that have been encountered on Polaris. Documentation will be updated as issues are resolved. Users are encouraged to email support@alcf.anl.gov to report issues.

Submitting Jobs

For batch job submissions, if the parameters within your submission script do not meet the parameters of any of the execution queues (small, ..., backfill-large) you might not receive the ""Job submission"" error on the command line at all, and the job will never appear in history qstat -xu <username> (current bug in PBS). E.g. if a user submits a script to the prod routing queue requesting 10 nodes for 24 hours, exceeding ""Time Max"" of 6 hrs of the small execution queue (which handles jobs with 10-24 nodes), then it may behave as if the job was never submitted.

Job scripts are copied to temporary locations after qsub and any changes to the original script while the job is queued will not be reflected in the copied script. Furthermore, qalter requires -A <allocation name> when changing job properties. Currently, there is a request for a qalter-like command to trigger a re-copy of the original script to the temporary location.

Compiling & Running Applications

If your job fails to start with an RPC launch message like below, please forward the complete messages to support@alcf.anl.gov.

bash
   launch failed on x3104c0s1b0n0: Couldn't forward RPC launch(ab751d77-e80a-4c54-b1c2-4e881f7e8c90) to child x3104c0s31b0n0.hsn.cm.polaris.alcf.anl.gov: Resource temporarily unavailable</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Note 1: You cannot submit to these queues directly, you can only submit to the routing queue ""prod"".

Note 2: All of these queues have a limit of ten (10) jobs running/accruing per-project

Note 3: All of these queues have a limit of one hundred (100) jobs queued (not accruing score) per-project

Note 4: As of January 2023, it is recommended to submit jobs with a maximum node count of 476-486 nodes given current rates of downed nodes (larger jobs may sit in the queue indefinitely).

Running MPI+OpenMP Applications

Once a submitted job is running calculations can be launched on the compute nodes using mpiexec to start an MPI application. Documentation is accessible via man mpiexec and some helpful options follow.

-n total number of MPI ranks

-ppn number of MPI ranks per node

--cpu-bind CPU binding for application

--depth number of cpus per rank (useful with --cpu-bind)

--env set environment variables (--env OMP_NUM_THREADS=2)

--hostfile indicate file with hostnames (the default is --hostfile $PBS_NODEFILE)

A sample submission script with directives is below for a 4-node job with 8 MPI ranks on each node and 8 OpenMP threads per rank. Each hardware thread runs a single OpenMP thread since there are 64 hardware threads on the CPU (2 per core).
You can download and compile hello_affinity from this link.

```bash

!/bin/bash -l

PBS -N AFFINITY

PBS -l select=4:ncpus=256

PBS -l walltime=0:10:00

PBS -q debug-scaling

PBS -A Catalyst  # Replace with your project

NNODES=wc -l < $PBS_NODEFILE
NRANKS=8 # Number of MPI ranks to spawn per node
NDEPTH=8 # Number of hardware threads per rank (i.e. spacing between MPI ranks)
NTHREADS=8 # Number of software threads per rank to launch (i.e. OMP_NUM_THREADS)

NTOTRANKS=$(( NNODES * NRANKS ))

echo ""NUM_OF_NODES= ${NNODES} TOTAL_NUM_RANKS= ${NTOTRANKS} RANKS_PER_NODE= ${NRANKS} THREADS_PER_RANK= ${NTHREADS}""

Introduction

NVIDIA® Nsight™ Systems provides developers a system-wide visualization of an applications performance. Developers can optimize bottlenecks to scale efficiently across any number or size of CPUs and GPUs on Polaris. For further optimizations to compute kernels developers should use Nsight Compute.

The NVIDIA Nsight Compute is an interactive kernel profiler for CUDA applications. It provides detailed performance metrics and API debugging via a user interface and command line tool.

In addition, the baseline feature of this tool allows users to compare results within the tool. NVIDIA Nsight Compute provides a customizable and data-driven user interface,  metric collection, and can be extended with analysis scripts for post-processing results.

Step-by-step guide

Common part on Polaris

Build your application for Polaris, and then submit your job script to Polaris or start an interactive job mode on Polaris as follows:

   spack-pe-base/0.6.1
   spack-pe-gnu/0.6.1

Note that spack-pe-base and spack-pe-gnu are metamodules which contain
further software offerings. See the Spack section below for details.

Spack

We have newly installed Spack deployments in /soft. Spack is an HPC-oriented
package manager which ALCF uses to install software for the user environment.
However, no knowledge of Spack is necessary to use these software offerings. All
ALCF-managed software is accessible to users via modules.

The base suite of software tools and libraries can be accessed by loading the
spack-pe-base module. This adds a path to $MODULEPATH which contains
numerous modules.

For example, to load cmake starting from the default environment, a user
should run the following commands:
module use /soft/modulefiles
module load spack-pe-base
module load cmake
Other modules in spack-pe-base can be browsed by running module avail or
module --show-hidden avail. The latter shows hidden modules which are
installed as dependencies of the un-hidden modules.

In addition to the base stack, a suite of higher-level libraries are installed
in the spack-pe-gnu module. These are built with and are dependent on
PrgEnv-gnu. A PrgEnv-nvidia-compatible stack will be available in the
future.

Note that not all software is installed through Spack; many applications and
libraries are installed as standalone packages in /soft. Users are encouraged
to browse the available modules with module avail to see what software is
installed on the system.

<DOCUMENT>FFmpeg on Polaris

NOTE: FFmpeg module is currently missing on Polaris after a recent upgrade. A spack build of ffmpeg will be available soon

To use FFmpeg on Polaris first load the corresponding module:

module load ffmpeg

This is a typical command line to create a movie from a series of snapshots in PNG format:

ffmpeg -r 15 -i frames.%03d.png -r 25 -pix_fmt yuv420p movie.mp4

where:

r 15 is the input frame rate. Experiment with values smaller than the output frame rate for longer movies.
-r 25 is the output frame rate (use this value for standard 25 frames per second)
-i frames.%03d.png reads the input frames in sequence
-pix_fmt yuv420p is needed for movies to play in browsers
movie.mp4 is the resulting movie</DOCUMENT>

You can search the full container registry here. For custom containers tailored for Polaris, visit ALCF's GitHub container registry

Note: Currently container build and executions are only supported on the Polaris compute nodes

Recipe-Based Container Building

As mentioned earlier, you can build Apptainer containers from recipe files. Instructions are available here. See available containers for more recipes.

Note: You can also build custom recipes by bootstrapping from prebuilt images. For e.g the first two lines in a recipe to use our custom Tensorflow implementation would be Bootstrap: oras followed by From: ghcr.io/argonne-lcf/tf2-mpich-nvidia-gpu:latest

Running Containers on Polaris

To run a container on Polaris you can use the submission script described here. Below is an explanation of the job submission script.

```bash

!/bin/sh

PBS -l select=2:system=polaris

PBS -q debug

PBS -l place=scatter

PBS -l walltime=0:30:00

PBS -l filesystems=home:grand

PBS -A

cd ${PBS_O_WORKDIR}

Building a Kokkos Application Using make

Here's an example Makefile:

```

KOKKOS_HOME set via:

module load kokkos

You can look at the first lines of $KOKKOS_HOME/KokkosConfigCommon.cmake to

see the flags used in cmake configuration of the kokkos library build. The

default Kokkos module on Polaris was built with PrgEnv-nvhpc and includes

Serial, OpenMP (threads) and CUDA backends. So you should have that

environment module loaded and include compiler flags for cuda and openmp:

Cray MPI wrapper for C++ and C compilers:

CXX=CC
CC=cc

CPPFLAGS=-cuda -fopenmp
LDFLAGS=

LDFLAGS=$(CPPFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS)
LDLIBS=-L$(KOKKOS_HOME)/lib64 -lkokkoscore -lkokkossimd -lpthread

SRCS=example1.cpp
OBJS=$(subst .cpp,.o,$(SRCS))

all: example1_polaris

example1_polaris: $(OBJS)
        $(CXX) $(LDFLAGS) -o example1_polaris $(OBJS) $(LDLIBS)

example1.o: example1.cpp

clean:
        rm -f $(OBJS)

distclean: clean
        rm -f example1_polaris
```

Configuring Your Own Kokkos Build on Polaris

Here are recommended environment settings and configuration to build your own
kokkos libraries on Polaris:

Environment

To match what was done in the centrally-built kokkos associated with the
modules discussed above, use the programming environment
PrgEnv-gnu, and use the Cray wrapper CC as the C++ compiler. You'll also
need to explicitly load the Cuda toolkit version 12.2.91 as shown:</DOCUMENT>

Special notes for Polaris

On Polaris, there is a known bug where python applications launched with mpi and that use fork to spawn processes can sometimes have unexplaned hangs.  For this reason, it is recommended to use start_method=""spawn"" on Polaris when using the MpiExecLauncher as is shown in the example config above.  Alternatively, another solution is to use the GNUParallelLauncher which uses GNU Parallel to spawn processes.  GNU Parallel can be loaded in your environment with the command module load gnu-parallel.  Both of these approaches will circumvent the hang issue from using fork.

Updates

For parsl versions after July 2023, the address passed in the HighThroughputExecutor needs to be set to address = address_by_interface(""bond0"").  With parsl versions prior to July 2023, it was recommended to use address = address_by_hostname() on Polaris, but with later versions this will not work on Polaris (or any other machine).</DOCUMENT>

Introduction

CUDA-GDB is the NVIDIA tool for debugging CUDA applications running on Polaris. CUDA-GDB is an extension to GDB, the GNU Project debugger. The tool provides developers with a mechanism for debugging CUDA applications running on actual hardware. This enables developers to debug applications without the potential variations introduced by simulation and emulation environments.

Step-by-step guide

Debug Compilation

NVCC, the NVIDIA CUDA compiler driver, provides a mechanism for generating the debugging information necessary for CUDA-GDB to work properly. The -g -G option pair must be passed to NVCC when an application is compiled for ease of debugging with CUDA-GDB; for example,
nvcc -g -G foo.cu -o foo
Using this line to compile the CUDA application foo.cu
* forces -O0 compilation, with the exception of very limited dead-code eliminations and register-spilling optimizations.
* makes the compiler include debug information in the executable

Running CUDA-gdb on Polaris compute nodes

Start an interactive job mode on Polaris as follows:

```
$ qsub -I -l select=1 -l walltime=1:00:00

$ cuda-gdb --version

<DOCUMENT>Note: that the particles.000* is still visible.

Unhide the particles.000*data: click Eye icon

Select particles.000*data: click on name

Filters->Alphabetical->Glyph or click on the Glyph icon from the menu bar

Glyph Type: Sphere

Radius:. 0.15

Orient: Unchecked

Scale Mode: off

Set Scale Factor: 1 - Edit: Checked

Maximum Number of Points: 3000

Mask Points: Checked

Random Mode: Unchecked

Click the Apply button

Since our goal was to unclutter the display, let's hide the particles.000*by toggling them off, by clicking on the Eye icon next to it in the Pipeline Browser

Let's also switch to the Display tab in the Object Inspector, with Glyph1 selected, and change the Color by value to GlyphVector. Since the GlyphVector value is based on the velocity. We can Edit Color Map...and choose the same Blue to Red Rainbow preset that we previously chose for velocity

12. Enter: Red Blood Cells

Now let's add in both of the other data sets, which are polygonal meshes which make up Red Blood Cells (RBCs).

These two data sets are essentially the same kind of data, so we can apply the same filters and make the same types of representation changes to each of them. However, some of the RBCs are marked by the simulation that generated them as healthy (rbc.000) and some of them are marked as diseased (bad_rbc.000).

Unhide the rbc.000 and bad_rbc.000 data sets by clicking the Eye icon next to each of them to make them visible

13. Using Color to Differentiate Data

To enable us to distinguish these two types of data from one other, we can vary their representations.

One way to do this is by setting the color of the two data sets to different colors. Repeat this process for each of rbc.000 and bad_rbc.000, picking different colors.

Select one of the rbc data sets in the Pipeline Browser

Go to the Displaytab in the Object Inspector

In the Color by:dropdown select Solid Color

Click on the Set Solid Color... button

Select a color from the Select Colordialog that appears</DOCUMENT>

Context: <DOCUMENT>3. Use ParaView

After the previous step, you can now select POLARIS@ANL in the File->Connect menu and press Connect

At this point a new window will pop up

There are a number of parameters that you must enter manually here:

Xterm executable: the path of a terminal on your system. The figure shows the case of a Mac with XQuartz. You may need to change these values for Windows or Linux.

SSH executable: the name of your ssh command. It may be different on Windows depending on the ssh client installed (i.e putty)

Remote machine: leave this value at polaris.alcf.anl.gov

Username: your ALCF user name

ParaView version: the version of Paraview that you want to use. Verify first that this version is installed on the system (as described at the top of this document). You will also need to add a -EGL suffix.

Example:
5.12.0-EGL

Client port: it is safe to use the default value

Server port: is is safe to use the default value

Number of nodes to reserve: enter the number of Polaris compute nodes you want to use for your job

Number of ranks per node: enter the number of ranks per node

Number of minutes to reserve: the duration of your job in minutes

Account: enter here the name of your ALCF allocation

Queue: the name of the Polaris queue you would like to use (i.e: debug for small, quick jobs, prod, preemptable)

File Systems: enter here the file systems you need for your job, separated with colons, no spaces. Keep in mind that your job may not run if one of these file systems is not available at that time, so enter these values carefully

Job name: safe to use default value. The PBS scheduler will assign this name to your job

Now you can press OK to establish the connection with a ParaView server on Polaris.

An ssh connection will be established with a Polaris login node and a password will be requested in a terminal, similar to the process you normally use to connect and work on the system.</DOCUMENT>

<DOCUMENT>Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) mode

MIG mode can be enabled and configured on Polaris by passing a valid configuration file to qsub:

qsub ... -l mig_config=/home/ME/path/to/mig_config.json ...

You can find a concise explanation of MIG concepts and terms at https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/tesla/mig-user-guide/index.html#concepts

Configuration

Please study the following example of a valid configuration file:

shell
{
  ""group1"": {
    ""gpus"": [0,1],
    ""mig_enabled"": true,
    ""instances"": {""7g.40gb"": [""4c.7g.40gb"", ""3c.7g.40gb""] }
  },
  ""group2"": {
    ""gpus"": [2,3],
    ""mig_enabled"": true,
    ""instances"": {""3g.20gb"": [""2c.3g.20gb"", ""1c.3g.20gb""], ""2g.10gb"": [""2g.10gb""], ""1g.5gb"": [""1g.5gb""], ""1g.5gb"": [""1g.5gb""]}
  }
}

Notes

Group names are arbitrary, but must be unique

""gpus"" must be an array of integers.  if only one physical gpu is being configured in a group, it must still be contained within an array(ex. ""gpus"": [0],)

Only groups with mig_enabled set to true will be configured

instances denote the MIG gpu instances and the nested compute instances you wish to be configured

syntax is {""gpu instance 1"": [""cpu instance 1"", ""cpu instance 2""], ...}

valid gpu instances are 1g.5gb, 1g.10gb, 2g.10gb, 3g.20gb, 4g.20gb, and 7g.40gb.  the first number denotes the number of slots used out of 7 total, and the second number denotes memory in GB

the default cpu instance for any gpu instance has the same identifier as the gpu instance(in which case it will be the only one configurable)

other cpu instances can be configured with the identifier syntax Xc.Y, where X is the number of slots available in that gpu instance, and Y is the gpu instance identifier string

some gpu instances cannot be configured adjacently, despite there being sufficient slots/memory remaining(ex. 3g.20gb and 4g.20gb). Please see NVIDIA MIG documentation for further details</DOCUMENT>

User: How can you post-process ncu output files?
Assistant: Post-process via CLI: $ nsys stats {output_filename}.qdrep and $ ncu -i {output_filename}.ncu-rep.

The default Resolution is set to 100. This will make things a bit cluttered, especially when we start adding in the other data, so let's reduce this to 25

Click the Apply button

6. Streamlines as Tubes

The streamlines are just that, lines. We can use the Tubes filter to represent them as 3D objects, rather than just lines.
- With StreamTracer1selected in the Pipeline Browser, from the main menu select: Filters->Alphabetical->Tube
- In the Object Inspector make sure the Properties tab is selected
- The default value for the Radius is a bit too large for this data, let's set that value to 0
- Click the Apply button
- Notice that the StreamLine1 object has automatically been hidden
- There are many different ways to color these tubes
- With Tubes1 selected, switch to the Display tab in the Object Inspector
- The Color bydropdown lets you choose from a handful of different variables

7. Cutting Planes (Slices)

Now let's add some cutting plans, or slices, to see what the cross-section of the continuum data looks like.
- Again, be sure that the continuum.000*data is selected in the Pipeline Browser
- Filters->Alphabetical->Slice or Click on the Slice icon from the menu bar
- In the Object Inspector make sure the Propertiestab is selected
- At the bottom on the Object Inspector is a section titled Slice Offset Values. Here we can generate values for multiple slices to be made
- First click the Delete All button to remove initial values
- Next, click the New Range button. This will bring up an Add Range dialog box.
- Set the number of Steps to 7. Click OK
- Click the Apply button
- With Slice1 selected in the Object Inspector, switch to the Display tab
- Set Color by value to Velocity

<DOCUMENT>Containers on Polaris

Polaris, powered by NVIDIA A100 GPUs, benefits from container-based workloads for seamless compatibility across NVIDIA systems. This guide details the use of containers on Polaris, including custom container creation, large-scale execution, and common pitfalls.

Apptainer Setup

Polaris employs Apptainer (formerly known as Singularity) for container management. To set up Apptainer, run:

bash
module use /soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/install/modulefiles/Core
module load apptainer
apptainer version #1.2.2

The Apptainer version on Polaris is 1.2.2. Detailed user documentation is available here

Building from Docker or Argonne GitHub Container Registry

Containers on Polaris can be built by writing Dockerfiles on a local machine and then publish the container to DockerHub, or by directly building them on ALCF compute node by writing an Apptainer recipe file. If you prefer to use existing containers, you can pull them from various registries like DockerHub and run them on Polaris.

Since Docker requires root privileges, which users do not have on Polaris, existing Docker containers must be converted to Apptainer. To build a Docker-based container on Polaris, use the following as an example:</DOCUMENT>

<DOCUMENT>Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) mode

MIG mode can be enabled and configured on Polaris by passing a valid configuration file to qsub:

qsub ... -l mig_config=/home/ME/path/to/mig_config.json ...

You can find a concise explanation of MIG concepts and terms at https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/tesla/mig-user-guide/index.html#concepts

Configuration

Please study the following example of a valid configuration file:

shell
{
  ""group1"": {
    ""gpus"": [0,1],
    ""mig_enabled"": true,
    ""instances"": {""7g.40gb"": [""4c.7g.40gb"", ""3c.7g.40gb""] }
  },
  ""group2"": {
    ""gpus"": [2,3],
    ""mig_enabled"": true,
    ""instances"": {""3g.20gb"": [""2c.3g.20gb"", ""1c.3g.20gb""], ""2g.10gb"": [""2g.10gb""], ""1g.5gb"": [""1g.5gb""], ""1g.5gb"": [""1g.5gb""]}
  }
}

Notes

Group names are arbitrary, but must be unique

""gpus"" must be an array of integers.  if only one physical gpu is being configured in a group, it must still be contained within an array(ex. ""gpus"": [0],)

Only groups with mig_enabled set to true will be configured

instances denote the MIG gpu instances and the nested compute instances you wish to be configured

syntax is {""gpu instance 1"": [""cpu instance 1"", ""cpu instance 2""], ...}

valid gpu instances are 1g.5gb, 1g.10gb, 2g.10gb, 3g.20gb, 4g.20gb, and 7g.40gb.  the first number denotes the number of slots used out of 7 total, and the second number denotes memory in GB

the default cpu instance for any gpu instance has the same identifier as the gpu instance(in which case it will be the only one configurable)

other cpu instances can be configured with the identifier syntax Xc.Y, where X is the number of slots available in that gpu instance, and Y is the gpu instance identifier string

some gpu instances cannot be configured adjacently, despite there being sufficient slots/memory remaining(ex. 3g.20gb and 4g.20gb). Please see NVIDIA MIG documentation for further details</DOCUMENT>

Julia Project Environment

The Julia built-in package manager allows you to create a project and enable
project-specific dependencies. Julia manages packages in the Julia depot located
by default in ~/.julia. However, that NFS filesystem is not meant for
high-speed access. Therefore, this Julia depot folder should be located on a
fast filesystem of your choice (grand, eagle). The Julia depot directory is
set via the environment variable JULIA_DEPOT_PATH. For example, you can set
the Julia depot to a directory on Polaris grand filesystem by adding the following line
to your ~/.bashrc file:

bash
export JULIA_DEPOT_PATH=/grand/$PROJECT/$USER/julia_depot

Programming Julia on Polaris

There are three key components to using Julia for large-scale computations:

MPI support through MPI.jl

GPU support through CUDA.jl

HDF5 support through HDF5.jl

In addition, we recommend VSCode with the Julia
extension for a modern IDE experience, together
with the ssh-remote extension for remote interactive development.

MPI Support

MPI support is provided through the MPI.jl.
bash
$ julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(""MPI"")'
This will install the MPI.jl package and default MPI prebuilt binaries provided by an artifact. For on-node debugging purposes the default artifact is sufficient. However, for large-scale computations, it is important to use the Cray MPICH installed on Polaris. As of MPI.jl v0.20 this is handled through MPIPrefences.jl.
$ julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(""MPIPreferences"")'
$ julia --project -e 'using MPIPreferences; MPIPreferences.use_system_binary(vendor=""cray"")'

The vendor=""cray"" option is important if you intend to use gpu-aware MPI in your applications.

Check that the correct MPI library is targeted with Julia.
```
julia --project -e 'using MPI; MPI.versioninfo()'

<DOCUMENT>Use TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.  Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.  When possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention.

Use XLA compilation on your code.  XLA is the Accelerated Linear Algebra library that is available in tensorFlow and critical in software like JAX.  XLA will compile a tf.Graph object, generated with tf.function or similar, and perform optimizations like operation-fusion.  XLA can give impressive performance boosts with almost no user changes except to set an environment variable TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2.  If your code is complex, or has dynamically sized tensors (tensors where the shape changes every iteration), XLA can be detrimental: the overhead for compiling functions can be large enough to mitigate performance improvements.  XLA is particularly powerful when combined with reduced precision, yielding speedups > 100% in some models.

Multi-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up

TensorFlow is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with tensorFlow has been seen with horovod in particular.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation.  Some polaris specific details that may be helpful to you:

CPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.  In particular, we encourage users to try their scaling measurements with the following settings:

<DOCUMENT>Spack PE

Spack is an HPC-oriented package manager which ALCF uses to install software for
the user environment.

ALCF's Spack PE is a Spack-managed software stack which provides various build
tools, utilities, and libraries. It consists of a base stack (spack-pe-base)
and PrgEnv-dependent stacks (currently spack-pe-gnu).

spack-pe-base contains commonplace software compiled for CPU with the system
GCC compilers. Accordingly, the software in spack-pe-base can be used
regardless of programming environment.

spack-pe-gnu is based on the E4S Project and
provides performant HPC libraries built with PrgEnv-gnu and the nvcc CUDA
compiler driver for GPU code. spack-pe-gnu is dependent on both
spack-pe-base and PrgEnv-gnu.

Using software from the Spack PE

The base suite of software tools and libraries can be accessed by loading the
spack-pe-base module. This adds a path to $MODULEPATH which contains
numerous modules.

For example, to load cmake starting from the default environment, a user
should run the following commands:
module use /soft/modulefiles
module load spack-pe-base
module load cmake

The spack-pe-base module adds paths to the user's MODULEPATH; individual packages are subsequently loaded through the newly available modules. The full list of available packages can be viewed by running module avail or module --show-hidden avail for a complete listing. Packages are loaded in the same way from spack-pe-gnu.

Inspecting packages

When a module in the Spack PE is loaded, several environment variables are
updated to integrate the package into the user's environment. Additionally, the
PACKAGE_ROOT variable is set to the path to the installation prefix of the
package. For example, after loading cmake as above:

$ echo $CMAKE_ROOT
/soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/install/linux-sles15-x86_64/gcc-12.3.0/cmake-3.27.7-a435jtzvweeos2es6enirbxdjdqhqgdp/

<DOCUMENT>Julia

Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for
technical computing. It has a syntax familiar to users of many other
technical computing environments. Designed at MIT to tackle large-scale
partial-differential equation simulation and distributed linear algebra, Julia
features a robust ecosystem of tools for
optimization,
statistics, parallel programming, and data
visualization. Julia is actively developed by the Julia
Labs team at MIT and in
industry, along with hundreds of domain-expert
scientists and programmers worldwide.

Contributing

This guide is a first draft of the Julia documentation for Polaris. If you have any
suggestions or contributions, please open a pull request or contact us by
opening a ticket at the ALCF Helpdesk.

Julia Installation

We encourage users interested in using Julia on Polaris to install in their home or project directories at this time. Using the official Julia 1.9 binaries from the Julia
webpage is recommended.
Juliaup provides a convenient way to
install Julia and manage the various Julia versions. The default installation will install julia, juliaup, and other commands in a ${HOME}/.julia directory and update profile files like .bashrc to update PATH to include that directory. One can customize the installation to change these defaults.

bash
module load craype-accel-nvidia80
curl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh

If you chose a custom installation, then be sure to update the PATH environment variable appropriately.

export PATH=${HOME}/.juliaup/bin:${PATH}

You may then list the available Julia versions with juliaup list and install a
specific version with juliaup install <version>. You can then activate a
specific version with juliaup use <version> and set the default version with
juliaup default <version>. juliaup update will update the installed Julia
versions. In general, the latest stable release of Julia should be used.

bash
juliaup add release

If the application instead relies on the job launcher to bind MPI ranks to available GPUs, then a small helper script can be used to explicitly setCUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` appropriately for each MPI rank. One example is available here where each MPI rank is similarly bound to a single GPU with round-robin assignment. The binding of MPI ranks to GPUs is discussed in more detail here.

A simple OpenCL example is available here. The OpenCL headers and library are available in the NVHPC SDK and cuda toolkits. The environment variable NVIDIA_PATH is defined for the PrgEnv-nvhpc programming environment. 
CC -o vecadd -g -O3 -std=c++0x  -I${NVIDIA_PATH}/cuda/include main.o -L${NVIDIA_PATH}/cuda/lib64 -lOpenCL

This simple example can be run on a Polaris compute node as follows.
```
$ ./vecadd
Running on GPU!
Using single-precision

Result is CORRECT!! :)
```

GPU OpenMP

A simple MPI-parallel OpenMP example is available here. Compilation proceeds similar to the above examples except for use of the -mp=gpu compiler flag to indicated compilation of OpenMP code for GPUs.

CC -g -O3 -std=c++0x -mp=gpu -gpu=cc80,cuda11.0 -c main.cpp -o vecadd

Similar to the OpenACC example above, this code binds MPI ranks to GPUs in a round-robin fashion. 
```
$ mpiexec -n 4 ./vecadd

of devices= 4

Rank 0 running on GPU 0!
Rank 1 running on GPU 1!
Rank 2 running on GPU 2!
Rank 3 running on GPU 3!

Result is CORRECT!! :)

<DOCUMENT>Mapping Programming Models to Polaris Modules

The table below offers some suggestions for how to get started setting up your environment on Polaris depending on the programming language and model. Note, mixed C/C++ and Fortran applications should choose the programming environment for the Fortran compiler because of mpi.mod and similar incompatibilities between Fortran-generated files from different compilers. Several simple examples for testing the software environment on Polaris for different programming models are available in the ALCF GettingStart repo.

Note, users are encouraged to use PrgEnv-nvhpc instead of PrgEnv-nvidia as the latter will soon be deprecated in Cray's PE. They are otherwise identical pointing to compilers from the same NVIDIA SDK version.

Context: <DOCUMENT>Controlling Where Your Job Runs

If you wish to have your job run on specific nodes form your select like this: -l select=1:vnode=<node name1>+1:vnode=<node name2>... . Obviously, that gets tedious for large jobs.

If you want to control the location of a few nodes, for example 2 out of 64, but the rest don't matter, you can do something like this: -l select=1:vnode=<node name1>+1:vnode=<node name2>+62:system=foo

Every node has a PBS resource called tier0 with a rack identifier and tier1 with a dragonfly group identifieer.  If you want all your nodes grouped in a rack, you can add the group specifier -l select=8:system=foo,place=scatter:group=tier0.  If you wanted everything in the same dragonfly group, replace tier0 with tier1.  Note that you have to also explicitly specify the place when you use group.  If you wanted a specific rack or dragonfly group instead of any of them, you are back to the select: -l select 10:tier0=x3001-g0.

Network: Rack and Dragonfly Group Mappings

Racks contain (7) 6U chassis; each chassis has 2 nodes for 14 nodes per rack

The hostnames are of the form xRRPPc0sUUb[0|1]n0 where:
RR is the row {30, 31, 32}
PP is the position in the row {30 goes 1-16, 31 and 32 go 1-12}
c is chassis and is always 0
s stands for slot, but in this case is the RU in the rack and values are {1,7,13,19,25,31,37}
b is BMC controller and is 0 or 1 (each node has its own BMC)
n is node, but is always 0 since there is only one node per BMC

So, 16+12+12 = 40 racks * 14 nodes per rack = 560 nodes.

Note that in production group 9 (the last 4 racks) will be the designated on-demand racks

The management racks are x3000 and X3100 and are dragonfly group 10

The TDS rack is x3200 and is dragonfly group 11</DOCUMENT>

Visit module is in the process of being updated.

Changes to Memory Limits on Login Nodes

Memory limits were lowered on the logins due to resource contention to 8GB of memory, and 8 cores per user. 
This might result in error messages indicating abnormal process termination for user processes run on logins.

Examples of the error messages people might see are:

nvcc error   : 'cudafe++' died due to signal 9 (Kill signal)

g++-12: fatal error: Killed signal terminated program cc1plus

These errors are likely due to exhausting the per-user resources on a login node as each user is allocated 8 cores and 8GB memory.
To avoid this you can either:

Reduce the parallelism of your compile, such as using -j or -j4 flags

Request a debug node and run your compile there where you will have the full resources of the node at your disposal</DOCUMENT>

<DOCUMENT>Kokkos

Kokkos

Kokkos Core implements a programming model in C++ for writing performance
portable applications targeting all major HPC platforms. For that purpose it
provides abstractions for both parallel execution of code and data
management. Kokkos is designed to target complex node architectures with
N-level memory hierarchies and multiple types of execution resources. It
currently can use Serial and OpenMP (threads) for CPU execution spaces
(""backends"") and CUDA, HIP, SYCL, and OpenMPTarget for GPU execution
spaces. By convention, Kokkos only allows one GPU backend at a time.

Kokkos on Polaris

Following the Polaris upgrade to HPCM
1.10,
the module setup to use the prebuilt Kokkos changed.

The prebuilt Kokkos on polaris includes 3 backends: Serial and OpenMP for CPU
execution and CUDA for GPU execution. To use it, run

module load craype-x86-milan
module load craype-accel-nvidia80
module swap PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-gnu
module use /soft/modulefiles
module load cuda-PrgEnv-nvidia/12.2.91
module load kokkos

This sets the following environment variables, some of which are used by
cmake:

KOKKOS_HOME - path to the lib64/, include/ files installed

LIBRARY_PATH - prepends $KOKKOS_HOME/lib64 to this variable used by cmake

CPATH - prepends $KOKKOS_HOME/include to this variable used by cmake

LD_LIBRARY_PATH - prepends $KOKKOS_HOME/lib64 to this variable

Building a Kokkos Application Using cmake

Add these lines to CMakeLists.txt:

find_package(Kokkos REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(myTarget Kokkos::kokkoscore)

Here is a simple example CMakeLists.txt to compile an example program:

```
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.22)
project(buildExample)
find_package(Kokkos REQUIRED)

More information in the ImageMagick webpage.</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Permission Denied Error: If you encounter permission errors during the build

Check your quota and delete any unnecessary files. 
Clean-up apptainer cache, ~/.apptainer/cache, and set the apptainer tmp and cache directories as below:
    bash
    export APPTAINER_TMPDIR=/tmp/apptainer-tmpdir
    mkdir $APPTAINER_TMPDIR
    export APPTAINER_CACHEDIR=/tmp/apptainer-cachedir/
    mkdir $APPTAINER_CACHEDIR 
Make sure you are not on a directory accessed with a symlink, i.e. check if pwd and pwd -P returns the same path.
If any of the above doesn't work, try running the build in your home directory.

Mapping to rank 0 on all nodes: Ensure that the container's MPI aligns with the system MPI. Follow the additional steps outlined in the container registry documentation for MPI on Polaris

libmpi.so.40 not found: This can happen if the container's application has an OpenMPI dependency which is not currently supported on Polaris. It can also spring up if the containers base environment is not debian architecture like Ubuntu. Ensure the application has an MPICH implementation as well. Also try removing .conda, .cache, and .local folders from your home directory and rebuild the container.</DOCUMENT>

Special notes for Polaris

On Polaris, there is a known bug where python applications launched with mpi and that use fork to spawn processes can sometimes have unexplaned hangs.  For this reason, it is recommended to use start_method=""spawn"" on Polaris when using the MpiExecLauncher as is shown in the example config above.  Alternatively, another solution is to use the GNUParallelLauncher which uses GNU Parallel to spawn processes.  GNU Parallel can be loaded in your environment with the command module load gnu-parallel.  Both of these approaches will circumvent the hang issue from using fork.

Updates

For parsl versions after July 2023, the address passed in the HighThroughputExecutor needs to be set to address = address_by_interface(""bond0"").  With parsl versions prior to July 2023, it was recommended to use address = address_by_hostname() on Polaris, but with later versions this will not work on Polaris (or any other machine).</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Result is CORRECT!! :)
``
If the application instead relies on the job launcher to bind MPI ranks to available GPUs, then a small helper script can be used to explicitly setCUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` appropriately for each MPI rank. One example is available here where each MPI rank is similarly bound to a single GPU with round-robin assignment. The binding of MPI ranks to GPUs is discussed in more detail here.

GPU OpenCL

A simple OpenCL example is available here. The OpenCL headers and library are available in the NVHPC SDK and cuda toolkits. The environment variable NVIDIA_PATH is defined for the PrgEnv-nvhpc programming environment. 
CC -o vecadd -g -O3 -std=c++0x  -I${NVIDIA_PATH}/cuda/include main.o -L${NVIDIA_PATH}/cuda/lib64 -lOpenCL

This simple example can be run on a Polaris compute node as follows.
```
$ ./vecadd
Running on GPU!
Using single-precision

Result is CORRECT!! :)
```

GPU OpenMP

A simple MPI-parallel OpenMP example is available here. Compilation proceeds similar to the above examples except for use of the -mp=gpu compiler flag to indicated compilation of OpenMP code for GPUs.

CC -g -O3 -std=c++0x -mp=gpu -gpu=cc80,cuda11.0 -c main.cpp -o vecadd

Similar to the OpenACC example above, this code binds MPI ranks to GPUs in a round-robin fashion. 
```
$ mpiexec -n 4 ./vecadd

of devices= 4

Rank 0 running on GPU 0!
Rank 1 running on GPU 1!
Rank 2 running on GPU 2!
Rank 3 running on GPU 3!

Note: Currently container build and executions are only supported on the Polaris compute nodes

Recipe-Based Container Building

As mentioned earlier, you can build Apptainer containers from recipe files. Instructions are available here. See available containers for more recipes.

Note: You can also build custom recipes by bootstrapping from prebuilt images. For e.g the first two lines in a recipe to use our custom Tensorflow implementation would be Bootstrap: oras followed by From: ghcr.io/argonne-lcf/tf2-mpich-nvidia-gpu:latest

<DOCUMENT>Mixed C/C++ & Fortran Applications

For applications consisting of a mix of C/C++ and Fortran that also uses MPI, it is suggested that the programming environment chosen for Fortran be used to build the full application because of mpi.mod (and similar) incompatibilities.

Compiling for GPUs

It is assumed the majority of applications to be built on Polaris will make use of the GPUs. As such, the craype-accel-nvidia80 module is in the default environment. This has the effect of the Cray compiler wrappers adding -gpu to the compiler invocation along with additional include paths and libraries. Additional compilers flags may be needed depending on the compiler and GPU programming model used (e.g. -cuda, -acc, or -mp=gpu).

This module also adds GPU Transport Layer (GTL) libraries to the link-line to support GPU-aware MPI applications.

<DOCUMENT>JAX

JAX is another popular python package for accelerated computing.  JAX is built on XLA (the same XLA TensorFlow uses) as well as AutoGrad, and additionally has acceleration tools that operate on functions such as vmap, jit, etc.  JAX is not as widespread in machine learning as TensorFlow and PyTorch for traditional models (Computer Vision, Language Models) though it is quickly gaining promienence.  JAX is very powerful when a program needs non-traditional autodifferentiation or vectorizatoin, such as: forward-mode AD, higher order derivatives, Jacobians, Hessians, or any combination of the above.  Users of JAX on Polaris are encouraged to read the user documentation in detail, particularly the details about pure-functional programming, no in-place operations, and the common mistakes in writing functions for the @jit decorator.

JAX on Polaris

JAX is installed on Polaris via the conda module, available with:
bash
module load conda; conda activate

Then, you can load JAX in python as usual (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):

```python

import jax
jax.version
'0.3.15'

```

Notes on JAX 0.3.15

On Polaris, due to a bug, an environment variable must be set to use JAX on GPUs.  The following code will crash:
python
import jax.numpy as numpy
a = numpy.zeros(1000)
outputting an error that looks like:
python
jaxlib.xla_extension.XlaRuntimeError: UNKNOWN: no kernel image is available for execution on the device

You can fix this by setting an environment variable:
bash
export XLA_FLAGS=""--xla_gpu_force_compilation_parallelism=1""

Scaling JAX to multiple GPUs and multiple Nodes

Jax has intrinsic scaling tools to use multiple GPUs on a single node, via the pmap function.  If this is sufficient for your needs, excellent.  If not, another alternative is to use the newer package mpi4jax.</DOCUMENT>

<DOCUMENT>NVIDIA Compilers on Polaris

The NVIDIA compilers (nvc, nvc++, nvcc, and nvfortran) are available on Polaris via the PrgEnv-nvhpc and nvhpc modules. There is currently a PrgEnv-nvidia module available, but that will soon be deprecated in Cray's PE, thus it is not recommend for use.

The Cray compiler wrappers map to NVIDIA compilers as follows.

cc -> nvc
CC -> nvc++
ftn -> nvfortran

Users are encouraged to look through NVIDIA's documentation for the NVHPC SDK and specific information on the compilers, tools, and libraries.

Notes on NVIDIA Compilers

PGI compilers

The NVIDIA programming environments makes available compilers from the NVIDIA HPC SDK. While the PGI compilers are available in this programming environment, it should be noted they are actually symlinks to the corresponding NVIDIA compilers.
pgcc -> nvc
pgc++ -> nvc++
pgf90 -> nvfortran
pgfortran -> nvfortran
While nvcc is the traditional CUDA C and CUDA C++ compiler for NVIDIA GPUs, the nvc, nvc++, and nvfortran compilers additionally target CPUs.

NVHPC SDK Directory Structure

Users migrating from CUDA toolkits to the NVHPC SDK may find it beneficial to review the directory structure of the hpc-sdk directory to find the location of commonly used libraries (including math libraries for the CPU). With the PrgEnv-nvhpc module loaded, the NVIDIA_PATH environment variable can be used to locate the path to various NVIDIA tools, libraries, and examples.

compiler/bin - cuda-gdb, ncu, nsys, ...

examples - CUDA-Fortran, OpenMP, ...

comm_libs - nccl, nvshmem, ...

compiler/libs - blas, lapack, ...

cuda/lib64 - cudart, OpenCL, ...

math_libs/lib64 - cublas, cufft, ...

Differences between nvcc and nvc/nvc++</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>This variable can be used to inspect software installations and find header or
library paths. Additionally, Spack packages have a .spack directory in the
installation prefix which contains build information and logs.

Building software with Spack

Spack is a powerful package manager designed for HPC.
The Spack PE is installed and managed with Spack; users can also install Spack
in their own home or project directory to manage their software builds. Spack
has a steep learning curve, but it may benefit workflows involving frequent
builds with complex dependencies.

For users who wish to use Spack to install their own software, we provide
configuration files corresponding to the Spack PE deployments. These
configuration files can be found in config directories in /soft/spack within
the respective Spack PE installation directories. For example, the
spack-pe-base/0.6.1 configurations are in /soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/config. Not
all of these settings will be useful for all builds and it is not recommended to
adopt these wholesale as global settings. The recommended method is to include
these settings ad hoc in a spack environment to control what information spack
uses for its builds.

Support requests and feedback should be directed to
support@alcf.anl.gov. For general Spack
questions, users are encouraged to consult the following resources:

Horovod works best when you limit the visible devices to only one GPU.  Note that if you import mpi4py or horovod, and then do something like os.environ[""CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES""] = hvd.local_rank(), it may not actually work!  You must set the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable prior to doing MPI.COMM_WORLD.init(), which is done in horovod.init() as well as implicitly in from mpi4py import MPI.   On Polaris specifically, you can use the environment variable PMI_LOCAL_RANK (as well as PMI_LOCAL_SIZE) to learn information about the node-local MPI ranks.

The table below offers some suggestions for how to get started setting up your environment on Polaris depending on the programming language and model. Note, mixed C/C++ and Fortran applications should choose the programming environment for the Fortran compiler because of mpi.mod and similar incompatibilities between Fortran-generated files from different compilers. Several simple examples for testing the software environment on Polaris for different programming models are available in the ALCF GettingStart repo.

Note, users are encouraged to use PrgEnv-nvhpc instead of PrgEnv-nvidia as the latter will soon be deprecated in Cray's PE. They are otherwise identical pointing to compilers from the same NVIDIA SDK version.

<DOCUMENT>ParaView on Polaris

The recommended way of running ParaView on Polaris is in client/server mode. This consists of running the ParaView client on your local resource, and the ParaView server on the Polaris compute nodes. The ParaView client needs to first be installed on your local resource, and needs to match the version that you run on Polaris.

There are multiple versions of ParaView installed on Polaris. To find the versions of ParaView currently available on Polaris run the following command on a login node: 
module use /soft/modulefiles
module avail paraview

Binary and source packages of the ParaView client for Linux, MacOS, and Windows are available from the ParaView Download Page.

Connecting to the ParaView server on Polaris

This section describes how to launch the ParaView server on Polaris from a local ParaView client.

Start ParaView Client

First, launch the ParaView client on your local resource. You will need to configure some server settings in the client. This initial set up should only need to be done once, and can be reused each time you want to run ParaView on Polaris.

Server Configuration

1. Select Connect

From the ParaView client choose to connect to a server by either clicking on the ""Connect"" icon in the menu bar

or selecting File->Connect from the main menu

2. Set Up Servers (first time only)

The first time you want to run a server on Polaris and have it connect to your local ParaView client, you will need to set up a Server. Once this server is set up, you can reuse it each time you run the ParaView client with the ParaView server on Polaris.

Kitware, the developers of ParaView, maintain a database of server configurations which you can retrieve through the ParaView client. In the File->Connect menu press the button named ""Fetch Servers"" and select POLARIS@ANL. Windows users should select ""windows to POLARIS@ANL"". Press ""Import Selected""

3. Use ParaView</DOCUMENT>

Context: <DOCUMENT>[""TensorFlow on Polaris\n\nTensorFlow is a popular, open-source deep learning framework developed and released by Google.  The TensorFlow home page has more information about TensorFlow, which you can refer to.  For trouble shooting on Polaris, please contact support@alcf.anl.gov.\n\nInstallation on Polaris\n\nTensorFlow is already pre-installed on Polaris, available in the conda module.  To use it from a compute node, please do:\n\nbash\nmodule load conda\nconda activate\n\nThen, you can load TensorFlow in python as usual (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):\n\n```python\n\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.version\n'2.9.1'\n\n```\n\nThis installation of TensorFlow was built from source and the CUDA libraries it uses are found via the CUDA_HOME environment variable (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):\n\nbash\n$ echo $CUDA_HOME\n/soft/datascience/cuda/cuda_11.5.2_495.29.05_linux\n\nIf you need to build applications that use this version of TensorFlow and CUDA, we recommend using these cuda libraries to ensure compatibility.  We periodically update the TensorFlow release, though updates will come in the form of new versions of the conda module.\n\nTensorFlow is also available through NVIDIA containers that have been translated to Singularity containers.  For more information about containers, please see the Containers documentation page.\n\nTensorFlow Best Practices on Polaris\n\nSingle Node Performance\n\nWhen running TensorFlow applications, we have found the following practices to be generally, if not universally, useful and encourage you to try some of these techniques to boost performance of your own applications.\n\nUse Reduced Precision. Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with TensorFlow operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the tf.keras.mixed_precision Policy, as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  If you use a custom training loop (and not keras.Model.fit), you will also need to apply loss scaling."", 'data/md/polaris/data-science-workflows/frameworks/tensorflow.md']</DOCUMENT>

<DOCUMENT>Instructions for gpt-neox:

We include below a set of instructions to get EleutherAI/gpt-neox running on Polaris.

A batch submission script for the following example is available here.

!!! warning ""Warning""

Load and activate the base conda environment:
  bash
  module load conda
  conda activate base

We've installed the requirements for running gpt-neox into a virtual
   environment. To activate this environment,
  bash
  source /soft/datascience/venvs/polaris/2022-09-08/bin/activate

Clone the EleutherAI/gpt-neox repository if it doesn't already exist:
  bash
  git clone https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neox

Navigate into the gpt-neox directory:
  bash
  cd gpt-neox


  Note
  The remaining instructions assume you're inside the gpt-neox directory

Create a DeepSpeed compliant hostfile (each line is formatted as hostname, slots=N):
  bash
  cat $PBS_NODEFILE > hostfile
  sed -e 's/$/ slots=4/' -i hostfile
  export DLTS_HOSTFILE=hostfile

Create a .deepspeed_env file to ensure a consistent environment across all
   workers
   bash
   echo ""PATH=${PATH} > .deepspeed_env""
   echo ""LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH} >> .deepspeed_env""
   echo ""http_proxy=${http_proxy} >> .deepspeed_env""
   echo ""https_proxy=${https_proxy} >> .deepspeed_env""

<DOCUMENT>Known Issues

This is a collection of known issues that have been encountered on Polaris. Documentation will be updated as issues are resolved. Users are encouraged to email support@alcf.anl.gov to report issues.

Submitting Jobs

For batch job submissions, if the parameters within your submission script do not meet the parameters of any of the execution queues (small, ..., backfill-large) you might not receive the ""Job submission"" error on the command line at all, and the job will never appear in history qstat -xu <username> (current bug in PBS). E.g. if a user submits a script to the prod routing queue requesting 10 nodes for 24 hours, exceeding ""Time Max"" of 6 hrs of the small execution queue (which handles jobs with 10-24 nodes), then it may behave as if the job was never submitted.

Job scripts are copied to temporary locations after qsub and any changes to the original script while the job is queued will not be reflected in the copied script. Furthermore, qalter requires -A <allocation name> when changing job properties. Currently, there is a request for a qalter-like command to trigger a re-copy of the original script to the temporary location.

Compiling & Running Applications

If your job fails to start with an RPC launch message like below, please forward the complete messages to support@alcf.anl.gov.

Context: <DOCUMENT>2. Select which data to view

Let's start by looking at the continuum.000*data. This is an unstructured mesh that has velocity and count (density) values.
- Hide other data sets using the Eyeball icon next their names in the Pipeline Browser.
  - Black = visible, Grey = hidden
- Select continuum.000*(name is highlighted) in the Pipeline Browser
  - Click on the name to highlight it
- When manipulating appearance or applying filters, these always affect the selected data set
- Switch to the Display tab in the Object Inspector
- Under Color by, select Velocity from the dropdown
  - There is also a shortcut to Color by in the menu bar near the top of the GUI
  -

3. Manipulating the Color Map

To change the colors used to represent the Velocity:
- Under Color byclick the Edit Color Map... button
- On the Color Scale Editor window click the Choose Preset button
- On the Preset Color Scales window, select: Blue to Red Rainbow, and click OK. Then click Close on the Color Scale Editor window
- You can also create and save your own color maps

4. Data Representation

In order to be able to see the particles and red blood cells inside the cylinder, we need to be able to see through it. If we scroll down a bit in the Object Inspector view:
- Group of controls labeled Style
- In the Representation dropdown, select Wireframe

5. Generate Streamlines

ParaView enables the generation of different types of data from existing data sets in the Pipeline

Streamlines: Generated from vectors of the flow field. These curves show the direction a fluid element will travel in at any point in time

Make sure that the continuum.000*data is selected in the Pipeline Browser

From the main menu select: Filters->Alphabetical->Stream Tracer, or click on the Stream Tracer icon from the menu bar

In the Object Inspector make sure the Properties tab is selected.

Scroll down to seeds, and change Seed Type to Line Source

Click the Y Axis button to set the seed line to run along the Y axis.</DOCUMENT>

On Polaris, the MPICH_OFI_CXI_PID_BASE=0 must be exported before the first call to mpiexec, and then incremented by 1 and re-exported before each successive call. This is done with the SmartSim API by adding env_vars={'MPICH_OFI_CXI_PID_BASE':str(0)} to the PalsMpiexecSettings() API.</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>VASP

What is VASP?

The Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) is a software package for performing electronic structure calculations with periodic boundary conditions. It is most commonly used that to perform density functional theory (DFT) calculations in a planewave basis using the projector augemented wave (PAW) method. A more complete description of VASP can be found here:
https://www.vasp.at

<DOCUMENT>Example Programs and Makefiles for Polaris

Several simple examples of building CPU and GPU-enabled codes on Polaris are available in the ALCF GettingStart repo for several programming models. If build your application is problematic for some reason (e.g. absence of a GPU), then users are encouraged to build and test applications directly on one of the Polaris compute nodes via an interactive job. The discussion below makes use of the NVHPC compilers in the default environment as illustrative examples. Similar examples for other compilers on Polaris are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo.

CPU MPI+OpenMP Example

One of the first useful tasks with any new machine, scheduler, and job launcher is to ensure one is binding MPI ranks and OpenMP threads to the host cpu as intended. A simple HelloWorld MPI+OpenMP example is available here to get started with.

The application can be straightforwardly compiled using the Cray compiler wrappers.
CC -fopenmp main.cpp -o hello_affinity

The executable hello_affinity can then be launched in a job script (or directly in shell of interactive job) using mpiexec as discussed here.

CUDA

Several variants of C/C++ and Fortran CUDA examples are available here that include MPI and multi-gpu examples.

One can use the Cray compiler wrappers to compile GPU-enabled applications as well. This example of simple vector addition uses the NVIDIA compilers.

<DOCUMENT>Kokkos

Kokkos

Kokkos Core implements a programming model in C++ for writing performance
portable applications targeting all major HPC platforms. For that purpose it
provides abstractions for both parallel execution of code and data
management. Kokkos is designed to target complex node architectures with
N-level memory hierarchies and multiple types of execution resources. It
currently can use Serial and OpenMP (threads) for CPU execution spaces
(""backends"") and CUDA, HIP, SYCL, and OpenMPTarget for GPU execution
spaces. By convention, Kokkos only allows one GPU backend at a time.

Kokkos on Polaris

Following the Polaris upgrade to HPCM
1.10,
the module setup to use the prebuilt Kokkos changed.

The prebuilt Kokkos on polaris includes 3 backends: Serial and OpenMP for CPU
execution and CUDA for GPU execution. To use it, run

module load craype-x86-milan
module load craype-accel-nvidia80
module swap PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-gnu
module use /soft/modulefiles
module load cuda-PrgEnv-nvidia/12.2.91
module load kokkos

This sets the following environment variables, some of which are used by
cmake:

KOKKOS_HOME - path to the lib64/, include/ files installed

LIBRARY_PATH - prepends $KOKKOS_HOME/lib64 to this variable used by cmake

CPATH - prepends $KOKKOS_HOME/include to this variable used by cmake

LD_LIBRARY_PATH - prepends $KOKKOS_HOME/lib64 to this variable

Building a Kokkos Application Using cmake

Add these lines to CMakeLists.txt:

find_package(Kokkos REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(myTarget Kokkos::kokkoscore)

Here is a simple example CMakeLists.txt to compile an example program:

```
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.22)

Horovod works best when you limit the visible devices to only one GPU.  Note that if you import mpi4py or horovod, and then do something like os.environ[""CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES""] = hvd.local_rank(), it may not actually work!  You must set the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable prior to doing MPI.COMM_WORLD.init(), which is done in horovod.init() as well as implicitly in from mpi4py import MPI.   On Polaris specifically, you can use the environment variable PMI_LOCAL_RANK (as well as PMI_LOCAL_SIZE) to learn information about the node-local MPI ranks.

Additional information to be provided.</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Result is CORRECT!! :)

If the application instead relies on the job launcher to bind MPI ranks to available GPUs, then a small helper script can be used to explicitly setCUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` appropriately for each MPI rank. One example is available here where each MPI rank is similarly bound to a single GPU with round-robin assignment. The binding of MPI ranks to GPUs is discussed in more detail here.

GPU OpenCL

A simple OpenCL example is available here. The OpenCL headers and library are available in the NVHPC SDK and cuda toolkits. The environment variable NVIDIA_PATH is defined for the PrgEnv-nvhpc programming environment. 
CC -o vecadd -g -O3 -std=c++0x  -I${NVIDIA_PATH}/cuda/include main.o -L${NVIDIA_PATH}/cuda/lib64 -lOpenCL

This simple example can be run on a Polaris compute node as follows.
```
$ ./vecadd
Running on GPU!
Using single-precision

Result is CORRECT!! :)
```

GPU OpenMP

A simple MPI-parallel OpenMP example is available here. Compilation proceeds similar to the above examples except for use of the -mp=gpu compiler flag to indicated compilation of OpenMP code for GPUs.

CC -g -O3 -std=c++0x -mp=gpu -gpu=cc80,cuda11.0 -c main.cpp -o vecadd

Similar to the OpenACC example above, this code binds MPI ranks to GPUs in a round-robin fashion. 
```
$ mpiexec -n 4 ./vecadd

Rank 0 running on GPU 0!
Rank 1 running on GPU 1!
Rank 2 running on GPU 2!
Rank 3 running on GPU 3!

```</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>CC -g -O3 -std=c++0x -cuda main.cpp -o vecadd

The craype-accel-nvidia80 module in the default environment will add the -gpu compiler flag for nvhpc compilers along with appropriate include directories and libraries. It is left to the user to provide an additional flag to the nvhpc compilers to select the target GPU programming model. In this case, -cuda is used to indicate compilation of CUDA code. The application can then be launched within a batch job submission script or as follows on one of the compute nodes.

<DOCUMENT>SmartSim and SmartRedis

SmartSim is an open source tool developed by the Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) designed to facilitate the integration of traditional HPC simulation applications with machine learning workflows.
There are two core components to SmartSim:

Infrastructure library (IL)
Provides API to start, stop and monitor HPC applications from Python
Interfaces with the scheduler launch jobs (PBSPro on Polaris and Cobalt on Theta/ThetaGPU)
Deploys a distributed in-memory database called the Orchestrator

SmartRedis client library
Provides clients that connect to the Orchestrator from Fortran, C, C++, Python code
The client API library enables data transfer to/from database and ability to load and run JIT-traced Python and ML runtimes acting on stored data

path.

Note: The cloning process can be quite slow.

Using pip install --user (not recommended)

!!! danger

With the conda environment setup, one can install common Python modules using
#!bash python3 pip install --users '<module-name>' which will install
packages in #!bash $PYTHONUSERBASE/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages.

The #!bash $PYTHONUSERBASE environment variable is automatically set when you
load the base conda module, and is equal to  #!bash
/home/$USER/.local/polaris/conda/YYYY-MM-DD.

Note, Python modules installed this way that contain command line binaries will
not have those binaries automatically added to the shell's #!bash $PATH. To
manually add the path:

bash
export PATH=""$PYTHONUSERBASE/bin:$PATH""

Be sure to remove this location from #!bash $PATH if you deactivate the base
Anaconda environment or unload the module.

Cloning the Anaconda environment, or using venv are both more flexible and
transparent when compared to #!bash --user installs.</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Spack PE

Spack is an HPC-oriented package manager which ALCF uses to install software for
the user environment.

ALCF's Spack PE is a Spack-managed software stack which provides various build
tools, utilities, and libraries. It consists of a base stack (spack-pe-base)
and PrgEnv-dependent stacks (currently spack-pe-gnu).

spack-pe-base contains commonplace software compiled for CPU with the system
GCC compilers. Accordingly, the software in spack-pe-base can be used
regardless of programming environment.

spack-pe-gnu is based on the E4S Project and
provides performant HPC libraries built with PrgEnv-gnu and the nvcc CUDA
compiler driver for GPU code. spack-pe-gnu is dependent on both
spack-pe-base and PrgEnv-gnu.

Using software from the Spack PE

The base suite of software tools and libraries can be accessed by loading the
spack-pe-base module. This adds a path to $MODULEPATH which contains
numerous modules.

For example, to load cmake starting from the default environment, a user
should run the following commands:
module use /soft/modulefiles
module load spack-pe-base
module load cmake

The spack-pe-base module adds paths to the user's MODULEPATH; individual packages are subsequently loaded through the newly available modules. The full list of available packages can be viewed by running module avail or module --show-hidden avail for a complete listing. Packages are loaded in the same way from spack-pe-gnu.

Inspecting packages

When a module in the Spack PE is loaded, several environment variables are
updated to integrate the package into the user's environment. Additionally, the
PACKAGE_ROOT variable is set to the path to the installation prefix of the
package. For example, after loading cmake as above:

$ echo $CMAKE_ROOT
/soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/install/linux-sles15-x86_64/gcc-12.3.0/cmake-3.27.7-a435jtzvweeos2es6enirbxdjdqhqgdp/
$ ls -a $CMAKE_ROOT
.  ..  bin  doc  share  .spack</DOCUMENT>

User: In an MPI-parallel OpenACC application, how does the GPU get bound to each rank?

Since our goal was to unclutter the display, let's hide the particles.000*by toggling them off, by clicking on the Eye icon next to it in the Pipeline Browser

Let's also switch to the Display tab in the Object Inspector, with Glyph1 selected, and change the Color by value to GlyphVector. Since the GlyphVector value is based on the velocity. We can Edit Color Map...and choose the same Blue to Red Rainbow preset that we previously chose for velocity

12. Enter: Red Blood Cells

Now let's add in both of the other data sets, which are polygonal meshes which make up Red Blood Cells (RBCs).

These two data sets are essentially the same kind of data, so we can apply the same filters and make the same types of representation changes to each of them. However, some of the RBCs are marked by the simulation that generated them as healthy (rbc.000) and some of them are marked as diseased (bad_rbc.000).

Unhide the rbc.000 and bad_rbc.000 data sets by clicking the Eye icon next to each of them to make them visible

13. Using Color to Differentiate Data

To enable us to distinguish these two types of data from one other, we can vary their representations.

One way to do this is by setting the color of the two data sets to different colors. Repeat this process for each of rbc.000 and bad_rbc.000, picking different colors.

Select one of the rbc data sets in the Pipeline Browser

Go to the Displaytab in the Object Inspector

CUDA.jl uses the nvcc compiler to compile GPU kernels. This will create object files in the TEMP filesystem. The default TMPDIR in a job on Polaris is set to a temp directory that only exists on the head node of a job. We recommend setting TEMPDIR to a local directory on each compute node.
bash
export TMPDIR=/local/scratch

A simple example to test gpu-aware MPI on multiple nodes is available here.</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>TensorFlow on Polaris

TensorFlow is a popular, open-source deep learning framework developed and released by Google.  The TensorFlow home page has more information about TensorFlow, which you can refer to.  For trouble shooting on Polaris, please contact support@alcf.anl.gov.

Installation on Polaris

TensorFlow is already pre-installed on Polaris, available in the conda module.  To use it from a compute node, please do:

bash
module load conda
conda activate

Then, you can load TensorFlow in python as usual (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):

```python

import tensorflow as tf
tf.version
'2.9.1'

```

This installation of TensorFlow was built from source and the CUDA libraries it uses are found via the CUDA_HOME environment variable (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):

bash
$ echo $CUDA_HOME
/soft/datascience/cuda/cuda_11.5.2_495.29.05_linux

If you need to build applications that use this version of TensorFlow and CUDA, we recommend using these cuda libraries to ensure compatibility.  We periodically update the TensorFlow release, though updates will come in the form of new versions of the conda module.

TensorFlow is also available through NVIDIA containers that have been translated to Singularity containers.  For more information about containers, please see the Containers documentation page.

TensorFlow Best Practices on Polaris

Single Node Performance

When running TensorFlow applications, we have found the following practices to be generally, if not universally, useful and encourage you to try some of these techniques to boost performance of your own applications.

Use Reduced Precision. Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with TensorFlow operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the tf.keras.mixed_precision Policy, as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  If you use a custom training loop (and not keras.Model.fit), you will also need to apply loss scaling.</DOCUMENT>

If the application instead relies on the job launcher to bind MPI ranks to available GPUs, then a small helper script can be used to explicitly setCUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` appropriately for each MPI rank. One example is available here where each MPI rank is similarly bound to a single GPU with round-robin assignment. The binding of MPI ranks to GPUs is discussed in more detail here.

GPU OpenCL

A simple OpenCL example is available here. The OpenCL headers and library are available in the NVHPC SDK and cuda toolkits. The environment variable NVIDIA_PATH is defined for the PrgEnv-nvhpc programming environment. 
CC -o vecadd -g -O3 -std=c++0x  -I${NVIDIA_PATH}/cuda/include main.o -L${NVIDIA_PATH}/cuda/lib64 -lOpenCL

This simple example can be run on a Polaris compute node as follows.
```
$ ./vecadd
Running on GPU!
Using single-precision

Result is CORRECT!! :)
```

GPU OpenMP

A simple MPI-parallel OpenMP example is available here. Compilation proceeds similar to the above examples except for use of the -mp=gpu compiler flag to indicated compilation of OpenMP code for GPUs.

CC -g -O3 -std=c++0x -mp=gpu -gpu=cc80,cuda11.0 -c main.cpp -o vecadd

Similar to the OpenACC example above, this code binds MPI ranks to GPUs in a round-robin fashion. 
```
$ mpiexec -n 4 ./vecadd

of devices= 4

Rank 0 running on GPU 0!
Rank 1 running on GPU 1!
Rank 2 running on GPU 2!
Rank 3 running on GPU 3!

Result is CORRECT!! :)

<DOCUMENT>Gateway nodes

There are 50 gateway nodes.  These nodes are not user accessible, but are used transparently for access to the storage systems.  Each node has a single 200 Gbps HDR IB card for access to the storage area network.  This gives a theoretical peak bandwidth of 1250 GB/s which is approximately the aggregate bandwidth of the global file systems (1300 GB/s).

Storage

Polaris has access to the ALCF global file systems.  Details on storage can be found here.</DOCUMENT>

Context: <DOCUMENT>Compiling and Linking Overview on Polaris

Compiling on Polaris Login and Compute Nodes

If your build system does not require GPUs for the build process, as is usually the case, compilation of GPU-accelerated codes is generally expected to work well on the Polaris login nodes. If your build system does require GPUs, you cannot yet compile on the Polaris login nodes, as they do not currently have GPUs installed. You may in this case compile your applications on the Polaris compute nodes. Do this by submitting an interactive single-node job, or running your build system in a batch job.

Home File System

Is it helpful to realize that there is a single HOME filesystem for users that can be accessed from the login and computes of each production resource at ALCF. Thus, users should be mindful of modifications to their environments (e.g. .bashrc) that may cause issues to arise due to differences between the systems.

Cray Programming Environment

The Cray Programming Environment (PE) uses three compiler wrappers for building software. These compiler wrappers should be used when building MPI-enabled applications.

cc - C compiler

CC - C++ compiler

ftn - Fortran compiler

Each of these wrappers can select a specific vendor compiler based on the PrgEnv module loaded in the environment. The following are some helpful options to understand what the compiler wrapper is invoking.

--craype-verbose : Print the command which is forwarded to the compiler invocation

--cray-print-opts=libs : Print library information

--cray-print-opts=cflags : Print include information

The output from these commands may be useful in build scripts where a compiler other than that invoked by a compiler wrapper is desired. Defining some variables as such may prove useful in those situations.
CRAY_CFLAGS=$(cc --cray-print-opts=cflags)
CRAY_LIB=$(cc --cray-print-opts=libs)
Further documentation and options are available via man cc and similar.

<DOCUMENT>Controlling Where Your Job Runs

If you wish to have your job run on specific nodes form your select like this: -l select=1:vnode=<node name1>+1:vnode=<node name2>... . Obviously, that gets tedious for large jobs.

If you want to control the location of a few nodes, for example 2 out of 64, but the rest don't matter, you can do something like this: -l select=1:vnode=<node name1>+1:vnode=<node name2>+62:system=foo

Every node has a PBS resource called tier0 with a rack identifier and tier1 with a dragonfly group identifieer.  If you want all your nodes grouped in a rack, you can add the group specifier -l select=8:system=foo,place=scatter:group=tier0.  If you wanted everything in the same dragonfly group, replace tier0 with tier1.  Note that you have to also explicitly specify the place when you use group.  If you wanted a specific rack or dragonfly group instead of any of them, you are back to the select: -l select 10:tier0=x3001-g0.

Network: Rack and Dragonfly Group Mappings

Racks contain (7) 6U chassis; each chassis has 2 nodes for 14 nodes per rack

The hostnames are of the form xRRPPc0sUUb[0|1]n0 where:
RR is the row {30, 31, 32}
PP is the position in the row {30 goes 1-16, 31 and 32 go 1-12}
c is chassis and is always 0
s stands for slot, but in this case is the RU in the rack and values are {1,7,13,19,25,31,37}
b is BMC controller and is 0 or 1 (each node has its own BMC)
n is node, but is always 0 since there is only one node per BMC

So, 16+12+12 = 40 racks * 14 nodes per rack = 560 nodes.

Note that in production group 9 (the last 4 racks) will be the designated on-demand racks

The management racks are x3000 and X3100 and are dragonfly group 10

The TDS rack is x3200 and is dragonfly group 11</DOCUMENT>

Users with different needs, such as assigning multiple GPUs per MPI rank, can modify the above script to suit their needs.

Interactive Jobs on Compute Nodes

Here is how to submit an interactive job to, for example, edit/build/test an application Polaris compute nodes:
qsub -I -l select=1 -l filesystems=home:eagle -l walltime=1:00:00 -q debug -A <project_name>

This command requests 1 node for a period of 1 hour in the debug queue, requiring access to the /home and eagle filesystems. After waiting in the queue for a node to become available, a shell prompt on a compute node will appear. You may then start building applications and testing gpu affinity scripts on the compute node.

NOTE: If you want to ssh or scp to one of your assigned compute nodes you will need to make sure your $HOME directory and your $HOME/.ssh directory permissions are both set to 700.

12. Enter: Red Blood Cells

Now let's add in both of the other data sets, which are polygonal meshes which make up Red Blood Cells (RBCs).

These two data sets are essentially the same kind of data, so we can apply the same filters and make the same types of representation changes to each of them. However, some of the RBCs are marked by the simulation that generated them as healthy (rbc.000) and some of them are marked as diseased (bad_rbc.000).

The following sequence of module commands can be used to switch to the GNU programming environment (gcc, g++, gfortran) and also have NVIDIA compilers available in your path.

module swap PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-gnu
module load nvhpc-mixed

The compilers invoked by the Cray MPI wrappers are listed for each programming environment in the following table.

module C C++ Fortran MPI Compiler Wrapper cc CC ftn PrgEnv-nvhpc nvc nvc++ nvfortran PrgEnv-gnu gcc g++ gfortran

Note, while gcc and g++ may be available in the default environment, the PrgEnv-gnu module is needed to provide gfortran.

Additional Compilers Provided by ALCF

The ALCF additionally provides compilers to enable the OpenMP and SYCL programming models for GPUs viaLLVM as documented here

Additional documentation for using compilers is available on the respective programming model pages: OpenMP and SYCL.

Linking

Dynamic linking of libraries is currently the default on Polaris. The Cray MPI wrappers will handle this automatically.

Notes on Default Modules

craype-x86-rome: While the Polaris compute nodes currently have Milan CPUs, this module is loaded by default to avoid the craype-x86-milan module from adding a zen3 target not supported in the default nvhpc/21.9 compilers. The craype-x86-milan module is expected to be made default once a newer nvhpc version (e.g. 22.5) is made the default.

craype-accel-nvidia80: This module adds compiler flags to enable GPU acceleration for NVHPC compilers along with gpu-enabled MPI libraries as it is assumed that the majority of applications to be compiled on Polaris will target the GPUs for acceleration. Users building cpu-only applications may find it useful to unload this module to silence ""gpu code generation"" warnings.

Julia Project Environment

The Julia built-in package manager allows you to create a project and enable
project-specific dependencies. Julia manages packages in the Julia depot located
by default in ~/.julia. However, that NFS filesystem is not meant for
high-speed access. Therefore, this Julia depot folder should be located on a
fast filesystem of your choice (grand, eagle). The Julia depot directory is
set via the environment variable JULIA_DEPOT_PATH. For example, you can set
the Julia depot to a directory on Polaris grand filesystem by adding the following line
to your ~/.bashrc file:

bash
export JULIA_DEPOT_PATH=/grand/$PROJECT/$USER/julia_depot

Programming Julia on Polaris

There are three key components to using Julia for large-scale computations:

MPI support through MPI.jl

GPU support through CUDA.jl

HDF5 support through HDF5.jl

In addition, we recommend VSCode with the Julia
extension for a modern IDE experience, together
with the ssh-remote extension for remote interactive development.

MPI Support

MPI support is provided through the MPI.jl.
bash
$ julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(""MPI"")'
This will install the MPI.jl package and default MPI prebuilt binaries provided by an artifact. For on-node debugging purposes the default artifact is sufficient. However, for large-scale computations, it is important to use the Cray MPICH installed on Polaris. As of MPI.jl v0.20 this is handled through MPIPrefences.jl.
$ julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(""MPIPreferences"")'
$ julia --project -e 'using MPIPreferences; MPIPreferences.use_system_binary(vendor=""cray"")'

The vendor=""cray"" option is important if you intend to use gpu-aware MPI in your applications.

Check that the correct MPI library is targeted with Julia.
```
julia --project -e 'using MPI; MPI.versioninfo()'
MPIPreferences:
  binary:  system
  abi:     MPICH

<DOCUMENT>Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) mode

MIG mode can be enabled and configured on Polaris by passing a valid configuration file to qsub:

qsub ... -l mig_config=/home/ME/path/to/mig_config.json ...

You can find a concise explanation of MIG concepts and terms at https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/tesla/mig-user-guide/index.html#concepts

Configuration

Please study the following example of a valid configuration file:

shell
{
  ""group1"": {
    ""gpus"": [0,1],
    ""mig_enabled"": true,
    ""instances"": {""7g.40gb"": [""4c.7g.40gb"", ""3c.7g.40gb""] }
  },
  ""group2"": {
    ""gpus"": [2,3],
    ""mig_enabled"": true,
    ""instances"": {""3g.20gb"": [""2c.3g.20gb"", ""1c.3g.20gb""], ""2g.10gb"": [""2g.10gb""], ""1g.5gb"": [""1g.5gb""], ""1g.5gb"": [""1g.5gb""]}
  }
}

Notes

Group names are arbitrary, but must be unique

""gpus"" must be an array of integers.  if only one physical gpu is being configured in a group, it must still be contained within an array(ex. ""gpus"": [0],)

Only groups with mig_enabled set to true will be configured

instances denote the MIG gpu instances and the nested compute instances you wish to be configured

syntax is {""gpu instance 1"": [""cpu instance 1"", ""cpu instance 2""], ...}

valid gpu instances are 1g.5gb, 1g.10gb, 2g.10gb, 3g.20gb, 4g.20gb, and 7g.40gb.  the first number denotes the number of slots used out of 7 total, and the second number denotes memory in GB

the default cpu instance for any gpu instance has the same identifier as the gpu instance(in which case it will be the only one configurable)

other cpu instances can be configured with the identifier syntax Xc.Y, where X is the number of slots available in that gpu instance, and Y is the gpu instance identifier string

some gpu instances cannot be configured adjacently, despite there being sufficient slots/memory remaining(ex. 3g.20gb and 4g.20gb). Please see NVIDIA MIG documentation for further details</DOCUMENT>

<DOCUMENT>NVIDIA Compilers on Polaris

The NVIDIA compilers (nvc, nvc++, nvcc, and nvfortran) are available on Polaris via the PrgEnv-nvhpc and nvhpc modules. There is currently a PrgEnv-nvidia module available, but that will soon be deprecated in Cray's PE, thus it is not recommend for use.

The Cray compiler wrappers map to NVIDIA compilers as follows.

cc -> nvc
CC -> nvc++
ftn -> nvfortran

Users are encouraged to look through NVIDIA's documentation for the NVHPC SDK and specific information on the compilers, tools, and libraries.

Notes on NVIDIA Compilers

PGI compilers

The NVIDIA programming environments makes available compilers from the NVIDIA HPC SDK. While the PGI compilers are available in this programming environment, it should be noted they are actually symlinks to the corresponding NVIDIA compilers.
pgcc -> nvc
pgc++ -> nvc++
pgf90 -> nvfortran
pgfortran -> nvfortran
While nvcc is the traditional CUDA C and CUDA C++ compiler for NVIDIA GPUs, the nvc, nvc++, and nvfortran compilers additionally target CPUs.

NVHPC SDK Directory Structure

Users migrating from CUDA toolkits to the NVHPC SDK may find it beneficial to review the directory structure of the hpc-sdk directory to find the location of commonly used libraries (including math libraries for the CPU). With the PrgEnv-nvhpc module loaded, the NVIDIA_PATH environment variable can be used to locate the path to various NVIDIA tools, libraries, and examples.

compiler/bin - cuda-gdb, ncu, nsys, ...

examples - CUDA-Fortran, OpenMP, ...

comm_libs - nccl, nvshmem, ...

There are four login nodes available to users for editing code, building code, submitting / monitoring jobs, checking usage (sbank), etc..  Their full hostnames are polaris-login-N.hsn.cm.polaris.alcf.anl.gov  for N equal to 01 through 04; there are an additional two login nodes that are not user-accessible which are used for running services such as JupyterHub. The various compilers and libraries are present on the logins, so most users should be able to build their code.  However, if your build requires the physical presence of the GPU, you will need to build on a compute node.

All users share the same login nodes so please be courteous and respectful of your fellow users.  For example, please do not run computationally or IO intensive pre- or post-processing on the logins and keep the parallelism of your builds to a reasonable level.

<DOCUMENT>Running Multiple MPI Applications on a node

Multiple applications can be run simultaneously on a node by launching several mpiexec commands and backgrounding them. For performance, it will likely be necessary to ensure that each application runs on a distinct set of CPU resources and/or targets specific GPUs. One can provide a list of CPUs using the --cpu-bind option, which when combined with CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES provides a user with specifying exactly which CPU and GPU resources to run each application on. In the example below, four instances of the application are simultaneously running on a single node. In the first instance, the application is spawning MPI ranks 0-7 on CPUs 24-31 and using GPU 0. This mapping is based on output from the nvidia-smi topo -m command and pairs CPUs with the closest GPU.

```bash
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
mpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:24:25:26:27:28:29:30:31 ./hello_affinity &

export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1
mpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:16:17:18:19:20:21:22:23 ./hello_affinity &

export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2
mpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:8:9:10:11:12:13:14:15 ./hello_affinity &

export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=3
mpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:0:1:2:3:4:5:6:7 ./hello_affinity &

wait
```

Compute Node Access to the Internet

Currently, the only access the internet is via a proxy.  Here are the proxy environment variables for Polaris:

bash
export http_proxy=""http://proxy.alcf.anl.gov:3128""
export https_proxy=""http://proxy.alcf.anl.gov:3128""
export ftp_proxy=""http://proxy.alcf.anl.gov:3128""

In the future, though we don't have a timeline on this because it depends on future features in slingshot and internal software development, we intend to have public IP addresses be a schedulable resource.  For instance, if only your head node needed public access your select statement might looks something like: -l select=1:pubnet=True+63.

<DOCUMENT>Mixed C/C++ & Fortran Applications

For applications consisting of a mix of C/C++ and Fortran that also uses MPI, it is suggested that the programming environment chosen for Fortran be used to build the full application because of mpi.mod (and similar) incompatibilities.

Compiling for GPUs

It is assumed the majority of applications to be built on Polaris will make use of the GPUs. As such, the craype-accel-nvidia80 module is in the default environment. This has the effect of the Cray compiler wrappers adding -gpu to the compiler invocation along with additional include paths and libraries. Additional compilers flags may be needed depending on the compiler and GPU programming model used (e.g. -cuda, -acc, or -mp=gpu).

This module also adds GPU Transport Layer (GTL) libraries to the link-line to support GPU-aware MPI applications.

Changes to Memory Limits on Login Nodes

Memory limits were lowered on the logins due to resource contention to 8GB of memory, and 8 cores per user. 
This might result in error messages indicating abnormal process termination for user processes run on logins.

Examples of the error messages people might see are:

nvcc error   : 'cudafe++' died due to signal 9 (Kill signal)

g++-12: fatal error: Killed signal terminated program cc1plus

These errors are likely due to exhausting the per-user resources on a login node as each user is allocated 8 cores and 8GB memory.
To avoid this you can either:

Reduce the parallelism of your compile, such as using -j or -j4 flags

Request a debug node and run your compile there where you will have the full resources of the node at your disposal</DOCUMENT>

Context: <DOCUMENT>Notes

SmartSim workflows, such as online training, often require launching multiple MPI applications on the same set of nodes. On Polaris, the MPICH_OFI_CXI_PID_BASE=0 must be exported before the first call to mpiexec, and then incremented by 1 and re-exported before each successive call. This is done with the SmartSim API by adding env_vars={'MPICH_OFI_CXI_PID_BASE':str(0)} to the PalsMpiexecSettings() API.</DOCUMENT>

Troubleshooting Common Issues

Permission Denied Error: If you encounter permission errors during the build</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Mixed C/C++ & Fortran Applications

For applications consisting of a mix of C/C++ and Fortran that also uses MPI, it is suggested that the programming environment chosen for Fortran be used to build the full application because of mpi.mod (and similar) incompatibilities.

Compiling for GPUs

It is assumed the majority of applications to be built on Polaris will make use of the GPUs. As such, the craype-accel-nvidia80 module is in the default environment. This has the effect of the Cray compiler wrappers adding -gpu to the compiler invocation along with additional include paths and libraries. Additional compilers flags may be needed depending on the compiler and GPU programming model used (e.g. -cuda, -acc, or -mp=gpu).

This module also adds GPU Transport Layer (GTL) libraries to the link-line to support GPU-aware MPI applications.

Login nodes

There are four login nodes available to users for editing code, building code, submitting / monitoring jobs, checking usage (sbank), etc..  Their full hostnames are polaris-login-N.hsn.cm.polaris.alcf.anl.gov  for N equal to 01 through 04; there are an additional two login nodes that are not user-accessible which are used for running services such as JupyterHub. The various compilers and libraries are present on the logins, so most users should be able to build their code.  However, if your build requires the physical presence of the GPU, you will need to build on a compute node.

All users share the same login nodes so please be courteous and respectful of your fellow users.  For example, please do not run computationally or IO intensive pre- or post-processing on the logins and keep the parallelism of your builds to a reasonable level.

<DOCUMENT>Containers on Polaris

Polaris, powered by NVIDIA A100 GPUs, benefits from container-based workloads for seamless compatibility across NVIDIA systems. This guide details the use of containers on Polaris, including custom container creation, large-scale execution, and common pitfalls.

Apptainer Setup

Polaris employs Apptainer (formerly known as Singularity) for container management. To set up Apptainer, run:

bash
module use /soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/install/modulefiles/Core
module load apptainer
apptainer version #1.2.2

The Apptainer version on Polaris is 1.2.2. Detailed user documentation is available here

Building from Docker or Argonne GitHub Container Registry

Containers on Polaris can be built by writing Dockerfiles on a local machine and then publish the container to DockerHub, or by directly building them on ALCF compute node by writing an Apptainer recipe file. If you prefer to use existing containers, you can pull them from various registries like DockerHub and run them on Polaris.

Since Docker requires root privileges, which users do not have on Polaris, existing Docker containers must be converted to Apptainer. To build a Docker-based container on Polaris, use the following as an example:</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>SmartSim and SmartRedis

SmartSim is an open source tool developed by the Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) designed to facilitate the integration of traditional HPC simulation applications with machine learning workflows.
There are two core components to SmartSim:

Infrastructure library (IL)
Provides API to start, stop and monitor HPC applications from Python
Interfaces with the scheduler launch jobs (PBSPro on Polaris and Cobalt on Theta/ThetaGPU)
Deploys a distributed in-memory database called the Orchestrator

SmartRedis client library
Provides clients that connect to the Orchestrator from Fortran, C, C++, Python code
The client API library enables data transfer to/from database and ability to load and run JIT-traced Python and ML runtimes acting on stored data

<DOCUMENT>GNU Compilers on Polaris

The GNU compilers are available on Polaris via the PrgEnv-gnu and gcc-mixed modules. The gcc-mixed module can be useful when, for example, the PrgEnv-nvhpc compilers are used to compile C/C++ MPI-enabled code and gfortran is needed.

The GNU compilers currently on Polaris do not support GPU code generation and thus can only be used for compiling CPU codes.

The nvhpc and llvm compilers can be used for compiling GPU-enabled applications.</DOCUMENT>

User: What is the purpose of the PrgEnv-gnu module on Polaris?
Assistant: The purpose of the PrgEnv-gnu module on Polaris is to provide access to the GNU compilers for compiling CPU-enabled applications.

<DOCUMENT>Julia

Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for
technical computing. It has a syntax familiar to users of many other
technical computing environments. Designed at MIT to tackle large-scale
partial-differential equation simulation and distributed linear algebra, Julia
features a robust ecosystem of tools for
optimization,
statistics, parallel programming, and data
visualization. Julia is actively developed by the Julia
Labs team at MIT and in
industry, along with hundreds of domain-expert
scientists and programmers worldwide.

This guide is a first draft of the Julia documentation for Polaris. If you have any
suggestions or contributions, please open a pull request or contact us by
opening a ticket at the ALCF Helpdesk.

Julia Installation

We encourage users interested in using Julia on Polaris to install in their home or project directories at this time. Using the official Julia 1.9 binaries from the Julia
webpage is recommended.
Juliaup provides a convenient way to
install Julia and manage the various Julia versions. The default installation will install julia, juliaup, and other commands in a ${HOME}/.julia directory and update profile files like .bashrc to update PATH to include that directory. One can customize the installation to change these defaults.

bash
module load craype-accel-nvidia80
curl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh

If you chose a custom installation, then be sure to update the PATH environment variable appropriately.

export PATH=${HOME}/.juliaup/bin:${PATH}

You may then list the available Julia versions with juliaup list and install a
specific version with juliaup install <version>. You can then activate a
specific version with juliaup use <version> and set the default version with
juliaup default <version>. juliaup update will update the installed Julia
versions. In general, the latest stable release of Julia should be used.

bash
juliaup add release

<DOCUMENT>TensorFlow on Polaris

TensorFlow is a popular, open-source deep learning framework developed and released by Google.  The TensorFlow home page has more information about TensorFlow, which you can refer to.  For trouble shooting on Polaris, please contact support@alcf.anl.gov.

Installation on Polaris

TensorFlow is already pre-installed on Polaris, available in the conda module.  To use it from a compute node, please do:

bash
module load conda
conda activate

Then, you can load TensorFlow in python as usual (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):

```python

import tensorflow as tf
tf.version
'2.9.1'

```

This installation of TensorFlow was built from source and the CUDA libraries it uses are found via the CUDA_HOME environment variable (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):

bash
$ echo $CUDA_HOME
/soft/datascience/cuda/cuda_11.5.2_495.29.05_linux

If you need to build applications that use this version of TensorFlow and CUDA, we recommend using these cuda libraries to ensure compatibility.  We periodically update the TensorFlow release, though updates will come in the form of new versions of the conda module.

TensorFlow is also available through NVIDIA containers that have been translated to Singularity containers.  For more information about containers, please see the Containers documentation page.

TensorFlow Best Practices on Polaris

Single Node Performance

When running TensorFlow applications, we have found the following practices to be generally, if not universally, useful and encourage you to try some of these techniques to boost performance of your own applications.

Use Reduced Precision. Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with TensorFlow operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the tf.keras.mixed_precision Policy, as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  If you use a custom training loop (and not keras.Model.fit), you will also need to apply loss scaling.</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>To use SmartSim in the future, simply load the same modules and source the virtual environment.

``
When running on the login node, switch back to the default provided MPI binaries inMPI_jll.jl

by removing theLocalPreferences.toml` file.

GPU Support

NVIDIA GPU support is provided through the CUDA.jl package. The default in Julia is to download artifacts (e.g. CUDA toolkit) based on the runtime detected. While that should generally work, it is recommended to use the local CUDA installation provided on Polaris especially if using gpu-aware MPI in your workloads (important to use supported versions of CUDA with Cray MPICH provided).

To use the local CUDA installation provided by the modules on Polaris, the LocalPreferences.toml file can be modified as follows.

$ head $JULIA_DEPOT_PATH/environments/v1.10/LocalPreferences.toml
[CUDA_Runtime_jll]
local = true

If using the default PrgEnv-nvhpc module on Polaris, then it will be necessary to correct a path to the CUPTI library to successfully install CUDA.jl.

$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$CRAY_NVIDIA_PREFIX/cuda/12.2/extras/CUPTI/lib64/
$ julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(""CUDA"")'

The GPUs are not currently usable on the Polaris login nodes, so one can confirm the version of CUDA being used by testing in a batch or interactive job on a compute node.

Overview

The OpenMP API is an open standard for parallel programming. The specification document can be found here: https://www.openmp.org. The specification describes directives, runtime routines, and environment variables that allow an application developer to express parallelism (e.g. shared memory multiprocessing and device offloading). Many compiler vendors provide implementations of the OpenMP specification (https://www.openmp.org/specifications).

Setting the environment to use OpenMP on Polaris

Many of the programming environments available on Polaris have OpenMP support.

module OpenMP CPU support? OpenMP GPU support? PrgEnv-nvhpc yes yes llvm yes yes PrgEnv-gnu yes no PrgEnv-cray yes yes*

Currently PrgEnv-cray is not recommended for OpenMP offload.

By default, the PrgEnv-nvhpc module is loaded. To switch to other modules, you can use module switch.

Using PrgEnv-nvhpc

This is loaded by default, so there's no need to load additional modules. You can confirm that it is loaded by running module list to check that PrgEnv-nvhpc is in the list.

Using LLVM

To use the LLVM module, load the following.
module load mpiwrappers/cray-mpich-llvm
module load cudatoolkit-standalone

See the the LLVM compiling page here for more information.

Using PrgEnv-gnu

To switch from PrgEnv-nvhpc to PrgEnv-gnu you can run:

module switch PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-gnu

The gcc/gfortran on Polaris was not built with GPU support. To use OpenMP on the CPU, you need to unload craype-accel-nvidia80:

module unload craype-accel-nvidia80

Using PrgEnv-cray

To switch from PrgEnv-nvhpc to PrgEnv-cray you can run:

module switch PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-cray

To use OpenMP on the CPU only, also unload craype-accel-nvidia80:

module unload craype-accel-nvidia80

To use OpenMP on the GPU, load cudatoolkit-standalone, although this is not recommended at the moment.
module load cudatoolkit-standalone

After the previous step, you can now select POLARIS@ANL in the File->Connect menu and press Connect

At this point a new window will pop up

There are a number of parameters that you must enter manually here:

Xterm executable: the path of a terminal on your system. The figure shows the case of a Mac with XQuartz. You may need to change these values for Windows or Linux.

SSH executable: the name of your ssh command. It may be different on Windows depending on the ssh client installed (i.e putty)

Remote machine: leave this value at polaris.alcf.anl.gov

Username: your ALCF user name

ParaView version: the version of Paraview that you want to use. Verify first that this version is installed on the system (as described at the top of this document). You will also need to add a -EGL suffix.

Example:
5.12.0-EGL

Client port: it is safe to use the default value

Server port: is is safe to use the default value

Number of nodes to reserve: enter the number of Polaris compute nodes you want to use for your job

Number of ranks per node: enter the number of ranks per node

Number of minutes to reserve: the duration of your job in minutes

Account: enter here the name of your ALCF allocation

Queue: the name of the Polaris queue you would like to use (i.e: debug for small, quick jobs, prod, preemptable)

File Systems: enter here the file systems you need for your job, separated with colons, no spaces. Keep in mind that your job may not run if one of these file systems is not available at that time, so enter these values carefully

Job name: safe to use default value. The PBS scheduler will assign this name to your job

Now you can press OK to establish the connection with a ParaView server on Polaris.

An ssh connection will be established with a Polaris login node and a password will be requested in a terminal, similar to the process you normally use to connect and work on the system.</DOCUMENT>

Differences between nvcc and nvc/nvc++

For users that want to continue using nvcc it is important to be mindful of differences with the newer nvc and nvc++ compilers. For example, the -cuda flag instructs nvcc to compile .cu input files to .cu.cpp.ii output files which are to be separately compiled, whereas the same -cuda flag instructs nvc, nvc++, and nvfortran to enable CUDA C/C++ or CUDA Fortran code generation. The resulting output file in each case is different (text vs. object) and one may see unrecognized format error when -cuda is incorrectly passed to nvcc.

Known Issues and Workarounds

If you are using nvcc to invoke nvc++ and compiling C++17 code, and are seeing the following warning and unable to compile C++17 constructs:

```
polaris-login-01(~)> nvcc --std=c++17 -ccbin nvc++ ~/smalltests/bool_constant.cpp
nvcc warning : The -std=c++17 flag is not supported with the configured host compiler. Flag will be ignored.

QMCPACK, is a modern high-performance open-source Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation code. Its main applications are electronic structure calculations of molecular, quasi-2D and solid-state systems. Variational Monte Carlo (VMC), diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) and a number of other advanced QMC algorithms are implemented. Orbital space auxiliary field QMC (AFQMC) has recently been added. By directly solving the Schrodinger equation, QMC methods offer greater accuracy than methods such as density functional theory, but at a trade-off of much greater computational expense.

Prebuilt executables are provided at /soft/applications/qmcpack.

Using pip install --user (not recommended)

!!! danger

With the conda environment setup, one can install common Python modules using
#!bash python3 pip install --users '<module-name>' which will install
packages in #!bash $PYTHONUSERBASE/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages.

The #!bash $PYTHONUSERBASE environment variable is automatically set when you
load the base conda module, and is equal to  #!bash
/home/$USER/.local/polaris/conda/YYYY-MM-DD.

Note, Python modules installed this way that contain command line binaries will
not have those binaries automatically added to the shell's #!bash $PATH. To
manually add the path:

bash
export PATH=""$PYTHONUSERBASE/bin:$PATH""

Be sure to remove this location from #!bash $PATH if you deactivate the base
Anaconda environment or unload the module.

Cloning the Anaconda environment, or using venv are both more flexible and
transparent when compared to #!bash --user installs.</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>JAX

JAX is another popular python package for accelerated computing.  JAX is built on XLA (the same XLA TensorFlow uses) as well as AutoGrad, and additionally has acceleration tools that operate on functions such as vmap, jit, etc.  JAX is not as widespread in machine learning as TensorFlow and PyTorch for traditional models (Computer Vision, Language Models) though it is quickly gaining promienence.  JAX is very powerful when a program needs non-traditional autodifferentiation or vectorizatoin, such as: forward-mode AD, higher order derivatives, Jacobians, Hessians, or any combination of the above.  Users of JAX on Polaris are encouraged to read the user documentation in detail, particularly the details about pure-functional programming, no in-place operations, and the common mistakes in writing functions for the @jit decorator.

JAX on Polaris

JAX is installed on Polaris via the conda module, available with:
bash
module load conda; conda activate

Then, you can load JAX in python as usual (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):

```python

import jax
jax.version
'0.3.15'

```

Notes on JAX 0.3.15

On Polaris, due to a bug, an environment variable must be set to use JAX on GPUs.  The following code will crash:
python
import jax.numpy as numpy
a = numpy.zeros(1000)
outputting an error that looks like:
python
jaxlib.xla_extension.XlaRuntimeError: UNKNOWN: no kernel image is available for execution on the device

You can fix this by setting an environment variable:
bash
export XLA_FLAGS=""--xla_gpu_force_compilation_parallelism=1""

Scaling JAX to multiple GPUs and multiple Nodes

Jax has intrinsic scaling tools to use multiple GPUs on a single node, via the pmap function.  If this is sufficient for your needs, excellent.  If not, another alternative is to use the newer package mpi4jax.</DOCUMENT>

Context: <DOCUMENT>Containers on Polaris

Polaris, powered by NVIDIA A100 GPUs, benefits from container-based workloads for seamless compatibility across NVIDIA systems. This guide details the use of containers on Polaris, including custom container creation, large-scale execution, and common pitfalls.

Apptainer Setup

Polaris employs Apptainer (formerly known as Singularity) for container management. To set up Apptainer, run:

bash
module use /soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/install/modulefiles/Core
module load apptainer
apptainer version #1.2.2

The Apptainer version on Polaris is 1.2.2. Detailed user documentation is available here

Building from Docker or Argonne GitHub Container Registry

Containers on Polaris can be built by writing Dockerfiles on a local machine and then publish the container to DockerHub, or by directly building them on ALCF compute node by writing an Apptainer recipe file. If you prefer to use existing containers, you can pull them from various registries like DockerHub and run them on Polaris.

Since Docker requires root privileges, which users do not have on Polaris, existing Docker containers must be converted to Apptainer. To build a Docker-based container on Polaris, use the following as an example:</DOCUMENT>

<DOCUMENT>Balsam

Balsam is a Python-based workflow manager that helps users execute large numbers of jobs, potentially with interjob dependencies, track job outcomes, and manage postprocessing analysis. A Balsam Site runs on a node with access to the job scheduler, where it can submit and monitor jobs. Overall job state is aggregated on the Balsam Server, making job data from all Sites accessible from any individual site (or the user's laptop), via the command-line interface or the Python API. To get information on how to use the command line tool, you can type balsam --help in your shell.

Full documentation for Balsam is available online.

Balsam requires Python 3.7+. To install Balsam on Polaris, first set up a virtual Python environment:

shell
module load conda
conda activate base
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --pre balsam

To use Balsam, users need an account on the Balsam server.  Users can get an account by contacting the ALCF Help Desk.  Once a user has an account, they can login and make a new site.  A Balsam site is a project space for your workflow. You will be prompted to select what machine (Polaris) you are working on when creating a new site:

shell
balsam login
balsam site init -n new-site new-site
cd new-site
balsam site start

There are four login nodes available to users for editing code, building code, submitting / monitoring jobs, checking usage (sbank), etc..  Their full hostnames are polaris-login-N.hsn.cm.polaris.alcf.anl.gov  for N equal to 01 through 04; there are an additional two login nodes that are not user-accessible which are used for running services such as JupyterHub. The various compilers and libraries are present on the logins, so most users should be able to build their code.  However, if your build requires the physical presence of the GPU, you will need to build on a compute node.

All users share the same login nodes so please be courteous and respectful of your fellow users.  For example, please do not run computationally or IO intensive pre- or post-processing on the logins and keep the parallelism of your builds to a reasonable level.

Running</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>and launch the ParaView server with

srizzi@x3005c0s7b0n0:~> mpirun -n 8 pvserver --server-port=8000
Waiting for client...
Connection URL: cs://x3005c0s7b0n0:8000
Accepting connection(s): x3005c0s7b0n0:8000

In this case pvserver will be listening on TCP port 8000 of your head node. You can change this port if you want.

Creating a tunnel over ssh

We need to establish an ssh tunnel to connect client to server. On your local machine open a new terminal and type:

ssh -v -N -L 8000:x3005c0s7b0n0:8000 polaris.alcf.anl.gov

where 8000 is a TCP port and x3005c0s7b0n0 the name of your head node. Adjust these values accordingly.

Among multiple lines with debug information,  you should see something like:

debug1: Local connections to LOCALHOST:8000 forwarded to remote address x3005c0s7b0n0:8000

Keep this terminal open for the duration of your session to keep the ssh tunnel active.

Now you are ready to launch your ParaView client locally. Keep in mind that client and servers versions must match. The ParaView version currently deployed on Polaris is 5.12.0

Connecting to ParaView server

Connect your ParaView client to the server configuration you created above. You can select Connect, either from the File menu, or the icon circled in the figure:

and selecting the configuration you created in a previous step.

The connection should point to:

localhost:8000

In the terminal where you launched the server you will see now that the connection is established. Note that ParaView may take a few seconds to connect. This is normal behavior.

username@x3005c0s7b0n0:~> mpirun -n 8 pvserver --server-port=8000
Waiting for client...
Connection URL: cs://x3005c0s7b0n0:8000
Accepting connection(s): x3005c0s7b0n0:8000
Client connected.

At this point you can use ParaView normally.</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>TensorFlow on Polaris

TensorFlow is a popular, open-source deep learning framework developed and released by Google.  The TensorFlow home page has more information about TensorFlow, which you can refer to.  For trouble shooting on Polaris, please contact support@alcf.anl.gov.

Installation on Polaris

TensorFlow is already pre-installed on Polaris, available in the conda module.  To use it from a compute node, please do:

bash
module load conda
conda activate

Then, you can load TensorFlow in python as usual (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):

```python

import tensorflow as tf
tf.version
'2.9.1'

```

This installation of TensorFlow was built from source and the CUDA libraries it uses are found via the CUDA_HOME environment variable (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):

bash
$ echo $CUDA_HOME
/soft/datascience/cuda/cuda_11.5.2_495.29.05_linux

If you need to build applications that use this version of TensorFlow and CUDA, we recommend using these cuda libraries to ensure compatibility.  We periodically update the TensorFlow release, though updates will come in the form of new versions of the conda module.

TensorFlow is also available through NVIDIA containers that have been translated to Singularity containers.  For more information about containers, please see the Containers documentation page.

TensorFlow Best Practices on Polaris

Single Node Performance

When running TensorFlow applications, we have found the following practices to be generally, if not universally, useful and encourage you to try some of these techniques to boost performance of your own applications.

Use Reduced Precision. Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with TensorFlow operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the tf.keras.mixed_precision Policy, as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  If you use a custom training loop (and not keras.Model.fit), you will also need to apply loss scaling.</DOCUMENT>

For example to compile a simple code hello.cpp:

For PrgEnv-nvhpc, after loading the modules as discussed above we would use:

CC -mp=gpu -gpu=cc80 hello.cpp
ftn -mp=gpu -gpu=cc80 hello.F90

For LLVM, after loading the modules as discussed above:

mpicxx -fopenmp -fopenmp-targets=nvptx64-nvidia-cuda hello.cpp

For PrgEnv-gnu, after loading the modules as discussed above we would use:

CC -fopenmp hello.cpp
ftn -fopenmp hello.F90

For PrgEnv-cray, after loading the modules as discussed above we would use:

CC -fopenmp hello.cpp
ftn -fopenmp hello.F90

Running on Polaris

To run, you can run the produced executable or with mpiexec in a job script, and then submit the script to the Polaris queue, like:

```
$ cat submit.sh

!/bin/sh

PBS -l select=1:system=polaris

PBS -l walltime=0:30:00

PBS -q debug

PBS -A Catalyst

PBS -l filesystems=home:eagle

cd ${PBS_O_WORKDIR}
 mpiexec -n 1 ./executable
$ # submit to the queue:
$ qsub -l select=1:system=polaris -l walltime=0:30:00 -l filesystems=home:eagle -q debug -A Catalyst ./submit.sh
```

In the above, having the PBS options in the script and on the command line is redundant, but we put it there to show both ways of launching. This submits the script to one node in the debug queue on Polaris, requesting 30 min and the eagle and home filesystems. It will charge project Catalyst for the time.

More details for setting up the job script are in Job Scheduling and Execution section.

!!! danger

With the conda environment setup, one can install common Python modules using
#!bash python3 pip install --users '<module-name>' which will install
packages in #!bash $PYTHONUSERBASE/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages.

The #!bash $PYTHONUSERBASE environment variable is automatically set when you
load the base conda module, and is equal to  #!bash
/home/$USER/.local/polaris/conda/YYYY-MM-DD.

Note, Python modules installed this way that contain command line binaries will
not have those binaries automatically added to the shell's #!bash $PATH. To
manually add the path:

bash
export PATH=""$PYTHONUSERBASE/bin:$PATH""

Be sure to remove this location from #!bash $PATH if you deactivate the base
Anaconda environment or unload the module.

Cloning the Anaconda environment, or using venv are both more flexible and
transparent when compared to #!bash --user installs.</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>JAX

JAX is another popular python package for accelerated computing.  JAX is built on XLA (the same XLA TensorFlow uses) as well as AutoGrad, and additionally has acceleration tools that operate on functions such as vmap, jit, etc.  JAX is not as widespread in machine learning as TensorFlow and PyTorch for traditional models (Computer Vision, Language Models) though it is quickly gaining promienence.  JAX is very powerful when a program needs non-traditional autodifferentiation or vectorizatoin, such as: forward-mode AD, higher order derivatives, Jacobians, Hessians, or any combination of the above.  Users of JAX on Polaris are encouraged to read the user documentation in detail, particularly the details about pure-functional programming, no in-place operations, and the common mistakes in writing functions for the @jit decorator.

JAX on Polaris

JAX is installed on Polaris via the conda module, available with:
bash
module load conda; conda activate

Then, you can load JAX in python as usual (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):

```python

import jax
jax.version
'0.3.15'

```

Notes on JAX 0.3.15

On Polaris, due to a bug, an environment variable must be set to use JAX on GPUs.  The following code will crash:
python
import jax.numpy as numpy
a = numpy.zeros(1000)
outputting an error that looks like:
python
jaxlib.xla_extension.XlaRuntimeError: UNKNOWN: no kernel image is available for execution on the device

You can fix this by setting an environment variable:
bash
export XLA_FLAGS=""--xla_gpu_force_compilation_parallelism=1""

Scaling JAX to multiple GPUs and multiple Nodes

Jax has intrinsic scaling tools to use multiple GPUs on a single node, via the pmap function.  If this is sufficient for your needs, excellent.  If not, another alternative is to use the newer package mpi4jax.</DOCUMENT>

Even with the continuum data represented as wireframe, there is still considerable occlusion of the interior structures. In order to further reduce this occlusion by the wireframe, we can make it more transparent.

Again, be sure that the continuum.000*data is selected in the Pipeline Browser

In the Object Inspector make sure the Display tab is selected

In the Object Inspector there is a section titled Style

Set Opacity to 0.2

9. Animating Simulation Data

Since our data has multiple time steps, we can easily animate through them to see how the data changes over time.

Simply click the Play button on the animation bar at the top of the GUI

Pause to make it stop

Loop: With this button toggled on, animation will repeat until stopped

10. Animations

Animations can be saved to disk as a movie file, to be played back later.

From the main menu: File->Save Animation

11. Particles as Glyphs

Glyphs are another way of visually representing data where the attributes of a graphical element are dictated by attributes of the data.

All of the particles are displayed as red points in the graphics window. There are ~39K particles in this particular data set, which makes the display a bit cluttered. In order to both filter some of these out, and create 3D representations for them, let's apply a glyph filter to this data.

Now let's add some of our other data back into the scene. Let's start with the particle data.

<DOCUMENT>Spack PE

Spack is an HPC-oriented package manager which ALCF uses to install software for
the user environment.

ALCF's Spack PE is a Spack-managed software stack which provides various build
tools, utilities, and libraries. It consists of a base stack (spack-pe-base)
and PrgEnv-dependent stacks (currently spack-pe-gnu).

spack-pe-base contains commonplace software compiled for CPU with the system
GCC compilers. Accordingly, the software in spack-pe-base can be used
regardless of programming environment.

spack-pe-gnu is based on the E4S Project and
provides performant HPC libraries built with PrgEnv-gnu and the nvcc CUDA
compiler driver for GPU code. spack-pe-gnu is dependent on both
spack-pe-base and PrgEnv-gnu.

Using software from the Spack PE

The base suite of software tools and libraries can be accessed by loading the
spack-pe-base module. This adds a path to $MODULEPATH which contains
numerous modules.

For example, to load cmake starting from the default environment, a user
should run the following commands:
module use /soft/modulefiles
module load spack-pe-base
module load cmake

The spack-pe-base module adds paths to the user's MODULEPATH; individual packages are subsequently loaded through the newly available modules. The full list of available packages can be viewed by running module avail or module --show-hidden avail for a complete listing. Packages are loaded in the same way from spack-pe-gnu.

Inspecting packages

When a module in the Spack PE is loaded, several environment variables are
updated to integrate the package into the user's environment. Additionally, the
PACKAGE_ROOT variable is set to the path to the installation prefix of the
package. For example, after loading cmake as above:

$ echo $CMAKE_ROOT
/soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/install/linux-sles15-x86_64/gcc-12.3.0/cmake-3.27.7-a435jtzvweeos2es6enirbxdjdqhqgdp/
$ ls -a $CMAKE_ROOT
.  ..  bin  doc  share  .spack</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>LLVM Compilers on Polaris

This page is not about LLVM-based Cray Compiling Environment (CCE) compilers from PrgEnv-cray but about open source LLVM compilers.

If LLVM compilers are needed without MPI support, simply load the llvm module.

Cray Programming Environment does not offer LLVM compiler support.
Thus cc/CC/ftn compiler wrappers using LLVM compilers currently are not available.
To use Clang with MPI, one can load the mpiwrappers/cray-mpich-llvm module which loads the following modules.

llvm, upstream llvm compilers

cray-mpich, MPI compiler wrappers mpicc/mpicxx/mpif90. mpif90 uses gfortran because flang is not ready for production use.

cray-pals, MPI launchers mpiexec/aprun/mpirun

Limitation There is no GPU-aware MPI library linking support by default. If needed, users should manually add the GTL (GPU Transport Layer) library to the application link line.

Update 04/25/2024 To access LLVM modules, module use /soft/modulefiles is required.

Building a Kokkos Application Using make

Here's an example Makefile:

```

KOKKOS_HOME set via:

module load kokkos

You can look at the first lines of $KOKKOS_HOME/KokkosConfigCommon.cmake to

see the flags used in cmake configuration of the kokkos library build. The

default Kokkos module on Polaris was built with PrgEnv-nvhpc and includes

Serial, OpenMP (threads) and CUDA backends. So you should have that

environment module loaded and include compiler flags for cuda and openmp:

Cray MPI wrapper for C++ and C compilers:

CXX=CC
CC=cc

CPPFLAGS=-cuda -fopenmp

```

Configuring Your Own Kokkos Build on Polaris

Here are recommended environment settings and configuration to build your own
kokkos libraries on Polaris:

Environment

To match what was done in the centrally-built kokkos associated with the
modules discussed above, use the programming environment
PrgEnv-gnu, and use the Cray wrapper CC as the C++ compiler. You'll also
need to explicitly load the Cuda toolkit version 12.2.91 as shown:</DOCUMENT>

"System: This is a chat between a user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions based on the context. The assistant should also indicate when the answer cannot be found in the context.
Context: <DOCUMENT>and launch the ParaView server with

srizzi@x3005c0s7b0n0:~> mpirun -n 8 pvserver --server-port=8000
Waiting for client...
Connection URL: cs://x3005c0s7b0n0:8000
Accepting connection(s): x3005c0s7b0n0:8000

In this case pvserver will be listening on TCP port 8000 of your head node. You can change this port if you want.

Creating a tunnel over ssh

We need to establish an ssh tunnel to connect client to server. On your local machine open a new terminal and type:

ssh -v -N -L 8000:x3005c0s7b0n0:8000 polaris.alcf.anl.gov

where 8000 is a TCP port and x3005c0s7b0n0 the name of your head node. Adjust these values accordingly.

Among multiple lines with debug information,  you should see something like:

debug1: Local connections to LOCALHOST:8000 forwarded to remote address x3005c0s7b0n0:8000

Keep this terminal open for the duration of your session to keep the ssh tunnel active.

Now you are ready to launch your ParaView client locally. Keep in mind that client and servers versions must match. The ParaView version currently deployed on Polaris is 5.12.0

Connecting to ParaView server

Connect your ParaView client to the server configuration you created above. You can select Connect, either from the File menu, or the icon circled in the figure:

and selecting the configuration you created in a previous step.

The connection should point to:

localhost:8000

In the terminal where you launched the server you will see now that the connection is established. Note that ParaView may take a few seconds to connect. This is normal behavior.

username@x3005c0s7b0n0:~> mpirun -n 8 pvserver --server-port=8000
Waiting for client...
Connection URL: cs://x3005c0s7b0n0:8000
Accepting connection(s): x3005c0s7b0n0:8000
Client connected.

At this point you can use ParaView normally.</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Polaris System Updates

2024-04-22

The management software on Polaris has been upgraded to HPCM 1.10
The following version changes are in place with the upgrade to HPCM 1.10:

HPE Cray Programming Environment (CPE) 23.12

SlingShot version 2.1.2

NVIDIA SDK 23.9

NVIDIA driver version 535.154.05

CUDA 12.2

SUSE 15 SP5

Releasing jobs

Jobs that were queued before the upgrade have been restored to the appropriate queues but are placed on user hold. 
Jobs are not expected to complete successfully due to the changes made to the system and software environments resulting from the upgrade. 
We recommend you review your jobs and either release the hold (qrls <jobid>) or delete it (qdel <jobid>) and resubmit as appropriate.

Users need to rebuild for the new PE environment and major OS upgrade. Existing binaries are unlikely to run successfully.

We have held all jobs submitted prior to the upgrade as a user hold. Users may release their existing jobs with qrls to run after they have rebuilt their binaries.

PBS does cache the job execution script.  If a change to the script is required due to a path changing post rebuild, the job will have to be resubmitted.

All application binaries should be rebuilt prior to further job submissions.

Re-building user codes

Many user codes will need to be re-built and/or re-linked against the newer version of the programming environment (23.12) and Spack provided dependencies.

Changes to the user software environment

In addition to the system upgrades, several changes have been made to the user
software environment which may impact user workflows.

Older PE versions removed

Older versions of the Cray PE (older than 23.12) are deprecated as they are incompatible with the
upgraded system stack and are no longer available for use.

``
If the application instead relies on the job launcher to bind MPI ranks to available GPUs, then a small helper script can be used to explicitly setCUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` appropriately for each MPI rank. One example is available here where each MPI rank is similarly bound to a single GPU with round-robin assignment. The binding of MPI ranks to GPUs is discussed in more detail here.

GPU OpenCL

A simple OpenCL example is available here. The OpenCL headers and library are available in the NVHPC SDK and cuda toolkits. The environment variable NVIDIA_PATH is defined for the PrgEnv-nvhpc programming environment. 
CC -o vecadd -g -O3 -std=c++0x  -I${NVIDIA_PATH}/cuda/include main.o -L${NVIDIA_PATH}/cuda/lib64 -lOpenCL

This simple example can be run on a Polaris compute node as follows.
```
$ ./vecadd
Running on GPU!
Using single-precision

Result is CORRECT!! :)
```

GPU OpenMP

A simple MPI-parallel OpenMP example is available here. Compilation proceeds similar to the above examples except for use of the -mp=gpu compiler flag to indicated compilation of OpenMP code for GPUs.

CC -g -O3 -std=c++0x -mp=gpu -gpu=cc80,cuda11.0 -c main.cpp -o vecadd

Similar to the OpenACC example above, this code binds MPI ranks to GPUs in a round-robin fashion. 
```
$ mpiexec -n 4 ./vecadd

of devices= 4

Rank 0 running on GPU 0!
Rank 1 running on GPU 1!
Rank 2 running on GPU 2!
Rank 3 running on GPU 3!

Result is CORRECT!! :)

<DOCUMENT>Compiling and Linking Overview on Polaris

Compiling on Polaris Login and Compute Nodes

If your build system does not require GPUs for the build process, as is usually the case, compilation of GPU-accelerated codes is generally expected to work well on the Polaris login nodes. If your build system does require GPUs, you cannot yet compile on the Polaris login nodes, as they do not currently have GPUs installed. You may in this case compile your applications on the Polaris compute nodes. Do this by submitting an interactive single-node job, or running your build system in a batch job.

Home File System

Is it helpful to realize that there is a single HOME filesystem for users that can be accessed from the login and computes of each production resource at ALCF. Thus, users should be mindful of modifications to their environments (e.g. .bashrc) that may cause issues to arise due to differences between the systems.

Cray Programming Environment

The Cray Programming Environment (PE) uses three compiler wrappers for building software. These compiler wrappers should be used when building MPI-enabled applications.

cc - C compiler

CC - C++ compiler

ftn - Fortran compiler

Each of these wrappers can select a specific vendor compiler based on the PrgEnv module loaded in the environment. The following are some helpful options to understand what the compiler wrapper is invoking.

--craype-verbose : Print the command which is forwarded to the compiler invocation

--cray-print-opts=libs : Print library information

--cray-print-opts=cflags : Print include information

The output from these commands may be useful in build scripts where a compiler other than that invoked by a compiler wrapper is desired. Defining some variables as such may prove useful in those situations.
CRAY_CFLAGS=$(cc --cray-print-opts=cflags)
CRAY_LIB=$(cc --cray-print-opts=libs)
Further documentation and options are available via man cc and similar.

What is Gromacs?

GROMACS is a versatile package to perform molecular dynamics, i.e. simulate the Newtonian equations of motion for systems with hundreds to millions of particles. It is primarily designed for biochemical molecules like proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids that have a lot of complicated bonded interactions, but since GROMACS is extremely fast at calculating the nonbonded interactions (that usually dominate simulations) many groups are also using it for research on non-biological systems, e.g. polymers.

<DOCUMENT>Programming Models on Polaris

The software environment on Polaris supports several parallel programming models targeting the CPUs and GPUs.

CPU Parallel Programming Models

The Cray compiler wrappers cc, CC, and ftn are recommended for MPI applications as they provide the needed include paths and libraries for each programming environment. A summary of available CPU parallel programming models and relevant compiler flags is shown below. Users are encouraged to review the corresponding man pages and documentation.

Programming Model GNU NVHPC LLVM OpenMP -fopenmp -mp -fopenmp OpenACC -- -acc=multicore --

Higher-level programming models such as Kokkos and Raja may also be used for CPU programming.

GPU Programming Models

A summary of available GPU programming models and relevant compiler flags is shown below for compilers that generate offloadable code. Users are encouraged to review the corresponding man pages and documentation.

Programming Model GNU NVHPC LLVM ONEAPI CUDA -- -cuda [-gpu=cuda8.0,cc11.0] -- -- HIP* -- -- -- -- OpenACC -- -acc -- -- OpenCL* -- -- -- -- OpenMP -- -mp=gpu -fopenmp-targets=nvptx64 -- SYCL -- -- -- -fsycl -fsycl-targets=nvptx64-nvidia-cuda -Xsycl-target-backend --cuda-gpu-arch=sm_80

Note, the llvm and oneapi modules are provided by ALCF to complement the compilers provided by the Cray PE on Polaris.

Higher-level programming models such as Kokkos and Raja may also be used for GPU programming.

OpenCL is supported, but does not require specific compiler flags per-se as the offloaded kernels are just-in-time compiled. Abstraction programming models, such as Kokkos, can be built on top of some of these programming models (see below).

A HIP compiler supporting the A100 GPUs is still to be installed on Polaris.

Context: <DOCUMENT>Balsam

Balsam is a Python-based workflow manager that helps users execute large numbers of jobs, potentially with interjob dependencies, track job outcomes, and manage postprocessing analysis. A Balsam Site runs on a node with access to the job scheduler, where it can submit and monitor jobs. Overall job state is aggregated on the Balsam Server, making job data from all Sites accessible from any individual site (or the user's laptop), via the command-line interface or the Python API. To get information on how to use the command line tool, you can type balsam --help in your shell.

Full documentation for Balsam is available online.

Balsam requires Python 3.7+. To install Balsam on Polaris, first set up a virtual Python environment:

shell
module load conda
conda activate base
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --pre balsam

To use Balsam, users need an account on the Balsam server.  Users can get an account by contacting the ALCF Help Desk.  Once a user has an account, they can login and make a new site.  A Balsam site is a project space for your workflow. You will be prompted to select what machine (Polaris) you are working on when creating a new site:

shell
balsam login
balsam site init -n new-site new-site
cd new-site
balsam site start

See the Balsam documentation for full details.</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>[""Use TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.  Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.  When possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention.\n\nUse XLA compilation on your code.  XLA is the Accelerated Linear Algebra library that is available in tensorFlow and critical in software like JAX.  XLA will compile a tf.Graph object, generated with tf.function or similar, and perform optimizations like operation-fusion.  XLA can give impressive performance boosts with almost no user changes except to set an environment variable TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2.  If your code is complex, or has dynamically sized tensors (tensors where the shape changes every iteration), XLA can be detrimental: the overhead for compiling functions can be large enough to mitigate performance improvements.  XLA is particularly powerful when combined with reduced precision, yielding speedups > 100% in some models.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nTensorFlow is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with tensorFlow has been seen with horovod in particular.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation.  Some polaris specific details that may be helpful to you:\n\nCPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.  In particular, we encourage users to try their scaling measurements with the following settings:\n\nSet the environment variable NCCL_COLLNET_ENABLE=1"", 'data/md/polaris/data-science-workflows/frameworks/tensorflow.md']</DOCUMENT>

What is Gromacs?

GROMACS is a versatile package to perform molecular dynamics, i.e. simulate the Newtonian equations of motion for systems with hundreds to millions of particles. It is primarily designed for biochemical molecules like proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids that have a lot of complicated bonded interactions, but since GROMACS is extremely fast at calculating the nonbonded interactions (that usually dominate simulations) many groups are also using it for research on non-biological systems, e.g. polymers.

Using GROMACS at ALCF

ALCF offers assistance with building binaries and compiling instructions for GROMACS. For questions, contact us at support@alcf.anl.gov.

Note, mixed C/C++ and Fortran applications should choose the programming environment for the Fortran compiler because of mpi.mod and similar incompatibilities between Fortran-generated files from different compilers. Several simple examples for testing the software environment on Polaris for different programming models are available in the ALCF GettingStart repo.

Note, users are encouraged to use PrgEnv-nvhpc instead of PrgEnv-nvidia as the latter will soon be deprecated in Cray's PE. They are otherwise identical pointing to compilers from the same NVIDIA SDK version.

<DOCUMENT>Gromacs on Polaris

What is Gromacs?

GROMACS is a versatile package to perform molecular dynamics, i.e. simulate the Newtonian equations of motion for systems with hundreds to millions of particles. It is primarily designed for biochemical molecules like proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids that have a lot of complicated bonded interactions, but since GROMACS is extremely fast at calculating the nonbonded interactions (that usually dominate simulations) many groups are also using it for research on non-biological systems, e.g. polymers.

Using GROMACS at ALCF

ALCF offers assistance with building binaries and compiling instructions for GROMACS. For questions, contact us at support@alcf.anl.gov.

Building Gromacs

The installed binary is build/bin/gmx_mpi.

Running Gromacs on Polaris

Prebuilt Gromacs binaries can be found in the directory /soft/applications/Gromacs/gromacs-2022.1.

A sample pbs script follows that will run GROMACS on two nodes, using 4 MPI ranks per node, and each rank with four OpenMP threads. The PME kernel owns one MPI rank and one GPU per node, while the nonbonded kernel uses 3 MPI ranks and 3 GPUs per node.

path.

Note: The cloning process can be quite slow.

Using pip install --user (not recommended)

!!! danger

With the conda environment setup, one can install common Python modules using
#!bash python3 pip install --users '<module-name>' which will install
packages in #!bash $PYTHONUSERBASE/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages.

The #!bash $PYTHONUSERBASE environment variable is automatically set when you
load the base conda module, and is equal to  #!bash
/home/$USER/.local/polaris/conda/YYYY-MM-DD.

Note, Python modules installed this way that contain command line binaries will
not have those binaries automatically added to the shell's #!bash $PATH. To
manually add the path:

bash
export PATH=""$PYTHONUSERBASE/bin:$PATH""

Be sure to remove this location from #!bash $PATH if you deactivate the base
Anaconda environment or unload the module.

Cloning the Anaconda environment, or using venv are both more flexible and
transparent when compared to #!bash --user installs.</DOCUMENT>

<DOCUMENT>ImageMagick on Polaris

To use ImageMagick on Polaris first load the corresponding module:

module use /soft/modulefiles
module load spack-pe-base imagemagick</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Note: that the particles.000* is still visible.

Unhide the particles.000*data: click Eye icon

Select particles.000*data: click on name

Filters->Alphabetical->Glyph or click on the Glyph icon from the menu bar

Glyph Type: Sphere

Radius:. 0.15

Orient: Unchecked

Scale Mode: off

Set Scale Factor: 1 - Edit: Checked

Maximum Number of Points: 3000

Mask Points: Checked

Random Mode: Unchecked

Click the Apply button

Since our goal was to unclutter the display, let's hide the particles.000*by toggling them off, by clicking on the Eye icon next to it in the Pipeline Browser

Let's also switch to the Display tab in the Object Inspector, with Glyph1 selected, and change the Color by value to GlyphVector. Since the GlyphVector value is based on the velocity. We can Edit Color Map...and choose the same Blue to Red Rainbow preset that we previously chose for velocity

12. Enter: Red Blood Cells

Now let's add in both of the other data sets, which are polygonal meshes which make up Red Blood Cells (RBCs).

These two data sets are essentially the same kind of data, so we can apply the same filters and make the same types of representation changes to each of them. However, some of the RBCs are marked by the simulation that generated them as healthy (rbc.000) and some of them are marked as diseased (bad_rbc.000).

Unhide the rbc.000 and bad_rbc.000 data sets by clicking the Eye icon next to each of them to make them visible

13. Using Color to Differentiate Data

To enable us to distinguish these two types of data from one other, we can vary their representations.

One way to do this is by setting the color of the two data sets to different colors. Repeat this process for each of rbc.000 and bad_rbc.000, picking different colors.

Select one of the rbc data sets in the Pipeline Browser

Go to the Displaytab in the Object Inspector

In the Color by:dropdown select Solid Color

Click on the Set Solid Color... button

Select a color from the Select Colordialog that appears</DOCUMENT>

Context: <DOCUMENT>VisIt on Polaris

Getting Started

The latest VisIt versions installed on Polaris are 3.3.3 and 3.4.0.

Please note that at the time of this writing VisIt version 3.4.0 does not yet have a client for Mac available.

Follow these steps to install VisIt on your local machine:

Download and install VisIt for your local platform (MacOS, Windows, Linux). The version you download must match the server version installed on Polaris. Use this page

Download the Polaris host profile for VisIt (you may need to right-click and choose ""Save link as..."" or ""Save target as..."")

Copy this file to a file called ~/.visit/hosts/host_anl_polaris.xml on Mac or Linux. [ We need to also specify this path for for Windows]

Note: VisIt allows the user to download host profiles for ANL, but all these settings are outdated. We are working with the VisIt developers to update the ANL host list.

Additional information for using VisIt in client/server mode here

Running VisIt

Start up VisIt on your local machine

Click File -> Open File and choose ""ANL Polaris"" from the ""Host"" dropdown

You'll be prompted for your password; enter your ALCF authenticator app response

When you open a selected file, it will launch a job on Polaris
You will need to specify the ""Bank"" (Project) to use when VisIt submits jobs to the queue on Polaris. Specify a project in the Options box.
If your environment doesn't get sourced correctly with non-interactive SSH, you can set the default project to use under Options -> Host profiles

<DOCUMENT>libEnsemble

libEnsemble is a Python toolkit for running dynamic ensembles of calculations.

Users provide generator and simulator functions to express their ensembles, where the generator can steer the ensemble based on previous results. These functions can portably submit external executables at any scale.

System details are detected, and dynamic resource management is provided. This includes automatically detecting, assigning, and reassigning
GPUs for ensemble members.

libEnsemble can be used in a consistent manner on laptops, clusters, and supercomputers with minimal required dependencies.

Getting libEnsemble on Polaris

libEnsemble is provided on Polaris in the conda module:

See the docs for more details on using python on Polaris.

libEnsemble examples

For a very simple example of using libEnsemble see the Simple Introduction tutorial

For an example that runs a small ensemble using a C application (offloading work to the GPU), see
the GPU app tutorial.
The required files for this tutorial can be found
in this directory.
A video demo is also available.

Job Submission

libEnsemble runs on the compute nodes on Polaris using either Python's
multiprocessing or mpi4py. The user can set the number of workers for
maximum concurrency. libEnsemble will detect the nodes available
from the PBS environment and use these for running simulations. Polaris supports
running multiple concurrent simulations on each node if desired.

A simple example batch script for a libEnsemble use case that runs five workers on one node:

```shell
    #!/bin/bash -l
    #PBS -l select=1:system=polaris
    #PBS -l walltime=00:15:00
    #PBS -l filesystems=home:grand
    #PBS -q debug
    #PBS -A

```

The script can be run with:

Or you can run an interactive session with:

<DOCUMENT>Use Reduced Precision. Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with PyTorch operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the PyTorch Automatic Mixed Precision package (AMP), as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  In PyTorch, users generally need to manage casting and loss scaling manually,  though context managers and function decorators can provide easy tools to do this.

PyTorch has a JIT module as well as backends to support op fusion, similar to TensorFlow's tf.function tools.  However, PyTorch JIT capabilities are newer and may not yield performance improvements.  Please see TorchScript for more information.

Multi-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up

PyTorch is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with PyTorch has been seen with both DDP and Horovod.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation or the Distributed Data Parallel documentation.  Some Polaris-specific details that may be helpful to you:

CPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.  In particular, we encourage users to try their scaling measurements with the following settings:

Set the environment variable NCCL_COLLNET_ENABLE=1

Set the environment varialbe NCCL_NET_GDR_LEVEL=PHB

Manually set the CPU affinity via mpiexec, such as with --cpu-bind verbose,list:0,8,16,24</DOCUMENT>

User: How does libEnsemble facilitate running dynamic ensembles of calculations?
Assistant: libEnsemble facilitates running dynamic ensembles of calculations by providing a framework for users to define their own generator and simulator functions, which can steer the ensemble based on previous results, while automatically detecting and assigning resources such as GPUs for ensemble members.

<DOCUMENT>QMCPACK on Polaris

QMCPACK, is a modern high-performance open-source Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation code. Its main applications are electronic structure calculations of molecular, quasi-2D and solid-state systems. Variational Monte Carlo (VMC), diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) and a number of other advanced QMC algorithms are implemented. Orbital space auxiliary field QMC (AFQMC) has recently been added. By directly solving the Schrodinger equation, QMC methods offer greater accuracy than methods such as density functional theory, but at a trade-off of much greater computational expense.

Prebuilt executables are provided at /soft/applications/qmcpack.
The directory of each installation also includes a job submission script example qmcpack-polaris.job.
Update build recipe is provided on GitHub.</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Running Multiple MPI Applications on a node

Multiple applications can be run simultaneously on a node by launching several mpiexec commands and backgrounding them. For performance, it will likely be necessary to ensure that each application runs on a distinct set of CPU resources and/or targets specific GPUs. One can provide a list of CPUs using the --cpu-bind option, which when combined with CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES provides a user with specifying exactly which CPU and GPU resources to run each application on. In the example below, four instances of the application are simultaneously running on a single node. In the first instance, the application is spawning MPI ranks 0-7 on CPUs 24-31 and using GPU 0. This mapping is based on output from the nvidia-smi topo -m command and pairs CPUs with the closest GPU.

```bash
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
mpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:24:25:26:27:28:29:30:31 ./hello_affinity &

export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1
mpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:16:17:18:19:20:21:22:23 ./hello_affinity &

export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2
mpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:8:9:10:11:12:13:14:15 ./hello_affinity &

export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=3
mpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:0:1:2:3:4:5:6:7 ./hello_affinity &

wait
```

Compute Node Access to the Internet

Currently, the only access the internet is via a proxy.  Here are the proxy environment variables for Polaris:

bash
export http_proxy=""http://proxy.alcf.anl.gov:3128""
export https_proxy=""http://proxy.alcf.anl.gov:3128""
export ftp_proxy=""http://proxy.alcf.anl.gov:3128""

In the future, though we don't have a timeline on this because it depends on future features in slingshot and internal software development, we intend to have public IP addresses be a schedulable resource.  For instance, if only your head node needed public access your select statement might looks something like: -l select=1:pubnet=True+63.

<DOCUMENT>libEnsemble

libEnsemble is a Python toolkit for running dynamic ensembles of calculations.

Users provide generator and simulator functions to express their ensembles, where the generator can steer the ensemble based on previous results. These functions can portably submit external executables at any scale.

System details are detected, and dynamic resource management is provided. This includes automatically detecting, assigning, and reassigning
GPUs for ensemble members.

libEnsemble can be used in a consistent manner on laptops, clusters, and supercomputers with minimal required dependencies.

Getting libEnsemble on Polaris

libEnsemble is provided on Polaris in the conda module:

See the docs for more details on using python on Polaris.

libEnsemble examples

For a very simple example of using libEnsemble see the Simple Introduction tutorial

For an example that runs a small ensemble using a C application (offloading work to the GPU), see
the GPU app tutorial.
The required files for this tutorial can be found
in this directory.
A video demo is also available.

Job Submission

libEnsemble runs on the compute nodes on Polaris using either Python's
multiprocessing or mpi4py. The user can set the number of workers for
maximum concurrency. libEnsemble will detect the nodes available
from the PBS environment and use these for running simulations. Polaris supports
running multiple concurrent simulations on each node if desired.

A simple example batch script for a libEnsemble use case that runs five workers on one node:

```shell
    #!/bin/bash -l
    #PBS -l select=1:system=polaris
    #PBS -l walltime=00:15:00
    #PBS -l filesystems=home:grand
    #PBS -q debug
    #PBS -A

```

The script can be run with:

Or you can run an interactive session with:

<DOCUMENT>Example Programs and Makefiles for Polaris

Several simple examples of building CPU and GPU-enabled codes on Polaris are available in the ALCF GettingStart repo for several programming models. If build your application is problematic for some reason (e.g. absence of a GPU), then users are encouraged to build and test applications directly on one of the Polaris compute nodes via an interactive job. The discussion below makes use of the NVHPC compilers in the default environment as illustrative examples. Similar examples for other compilers on Polaris are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo.

CPU MPI+OpenMP Example

One of the first useful tasks with any new machine, scheduler, and job launcher is to ensure one is binding MPI ranks and OpenMP threads to the host cpu as intended. A simple HelloWorld MPI+OpenMP example is available here to get started with.

The application can be straightforwardly compiled using the Cray compiler wrappers.
CC -fopenmp main.cpp -o hello_affinity

The executable hello_affinity can then be launched in a job script (or directly in shell of interactive job) using mpiexec as discussed here.

```

!/bin/sh

PBS -l select=1:system=polaris

PBS -l place=scatter

PBS -l walltime=0:30:00

PBS -l filesystems=home

MPI example w/ 16 MPI ranks per node spread evenly across cores

NNODES=wc -l < $PBS_NODEFILE
NRANKS_PER_NODE=16
NDEPTH=4
NTHREADS=1

NTOTRANKS=$(( NNODES * NRANKS_PER_NODE ))
echo ""NUM_OF_NODES= ${NNODES} TOTAL_NUM_RANKS= ${NTOTRANKS} RANKS_PER_NODE= ${NRANKS_PER_NODE} THREADS_PER_RANK= ${NTHREADS}""

mpiexec -n ${NTOTRANKS} --ppn ${NRANKS_PER_NODE} --depth=${NDEPTH} --cpu-bind depth ./hello_affinity
```

CUDA

Several variants of C/C++ and Fortran CUDA examples are available here that include MPI and multi-gpu examples.

One can use the Cray compiler wrappers to compile GPU-enabled applications as well. This example of simple vector addition uses the NVIDIA compilers.

<DOCUMENT>Containers on Polaris

Polaris, powered by NVIDIA A100 GPUs, benefits from container-based workloads for seamless compatibility across NVIDIA systems. This guide details the use of containers on Polaris, including custom container creation, large-scale execution, and common pitfalls.

Apptainer Setup

Polaris employs Apptainer (formerly known as Singularity) for container management. To set up Apptainer, run:

bash
module use /soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/install/modulefiles/Core
module load apptainer
apptainer version #1.2.2

The Apptainer version on Polaris is 1.2.2. Detailed user documentation is available here

Building from Docker or Argonne GitHub Container Registry

Containers on Polaris can be built by writing Dockerfiles on a local machine and then publish the container to DockerHub, or by directly building them on ALCF compute node by writing an Apptainer recipe file. If you prefer to use existing containers, you can pull them from various registries like DockerHub and run them on Polaris.

Since Docker requires root privileges, which users do not have on Polaris, existing Docker containers must be converted to Apptainer. To build a Docker-based container on Polaris, use the following as an example:</DOCUMENT>

<DOCUMENT>OpenMP

Overview

The OpenMP API is an open standard for parallel programming. The specification document can be found here: https://www.openmp.org. The specification describes directives, runtime routines, and environment variables that allow an application developer to express parallelism (e.g. shared memory multiprocessing and device offloading). Many compiler vendors provide implementations of the OpenMP specification (https://www.openmp.org/specifications).

Setting the environment to use OpenMP on Polaris

Many of the programming environments available on Polaris have OpenMP support.

module OpenMP CPU support? OpenMP GPU support? PrgEnv-nvhpc yes yes llvm yes yes PrgEnv-gnu yes no PrgEnv-cray yes yes*

Currently PrgEnv-cray is not recommended for OpenMP offload.

By default, the PrgEnv-nvhpc module is loaded. To switch to other modules, you can use module switch.

Using PrgEnv-nvhpc

This is loaded by default, so there's no need to load additional modules. You can confirm that it is loaded by running module list to check that PrgEnv-nvhpc is in the list.

Using LLVM

To use the LLVM module, load the following.
module load mpiwrappers/cray-mpich-llvm
module load cudatoolkit-standalone

See the the LLVM compiling page here for more information.

Using PrgEnv-gnu

To switch from PrgEnv-nvhpc to PrgEnv-gnu you can run:

module switch PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-gnu

The gcc/gfortran on Polaris was not built with GPU support. To use OpenMP on the CPU, you need to unload craype-accel-nvidia80:

module unload craype-accel-nvidia80

Using PrgEnv-cray

To switch from PrgEnv-nvhpc to PrgEnv-cray you can run:

module switch PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-cray

To use OpenMP on the CPU only, also unload craype-accel-nvidia80:

module unload craype-accel-nvidia80

To use OpenMP on the GPU, load cudatoolkit-standalone, although this is not recommended at the moment.
module load cudatoolkit-standalone

What is Gromacs?

GROMACS is a versatile package to perform molecular dynamics, i.e. simulate the Newtonian equations of motion for systems with hundreds to millions of particles. It is primarily designed for biochemical molecules like proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids that have a lot of complicated bonded interactions, but since GROMACS is extremely fast at calculating the nonbonded interactions (that usually dominate simulations) many groups are also using it for research on non-biological systems, e.g. polymers.

Using GROMACS at ALCF

Provides API to start, stop and monitor HPC applications from Python
Interfaces with the scheduler launch jobs (PBSPro on Polaris and Cobalt on Theta/ThetaGPU)
Deploys a distributed in-memory database called the Orchestrator

SmartRedis client library
Provides clients that connect to the Orchestrator from Fortran, C, C++, Python code
The client API library enables data transfer to/from database and ability to load and run JIT-traced Python and ML runtimes acting on stored data

Installation

SmartSim on Polaris can be installed creating a virtual environment based on the ML conda module
module load conda/2023-10-04
conda activate
module load cmake
module load gcc/11.2.0
module load cudatoolkit-standalone/11.8.0
python -m venv --clear /path/to/_ssim_env --system-site-packages
source /path/to/_ssim_env/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
Note that /path/to/ can either be a user's home or project directory.

To use SmartSim in the future, simply load the same modules and source the virtual environment.</DOCUMENT>

User: What steps are required to install SmartSim on Polaris for use with ML conda modules?
Assistant: Install SmartSim on Polaris by loading necessary modules, creating a virtual environment, activating the virtual environment, upgrading pip, and then installing SmartSim.

Context: <DOCUMENT>where, #!bash path/to/envs/base-clone should be replaced by a suitably chosen
path.

Note: The cloning process can be quite slow.

Using pip install --user (not recommended)

!!! danger

With the conda environment setup, one can install common Python modules using
#!bash python3 pip install --users '<module-name>' which will install
packages in #!bash $PYTHONUSERBASE/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages.

The #!bash $PYTHONUSERBASE environment variable is automatically set when you
load the base conda module, and is equal to  #!bash
/home/$USER/.local/polaris/conda/YYYY-MM-DD.

Note, Python modules installed this way that contain command line binaries will
not have those binaries automatically added to the shell's #!bash $PATH. To
manually add the path:

bash
export PATH=""$PYTHONUSERBASE/bin:$PATH""

Be sure to remove this location from #!bash $PATH if you deactivate the base
Anaconda environment or unload the module.

Cloning the Anaconda environment, or using venv are both more flexible and
transparent when compared to #!bash --user installs.</DOCUMENT>

<DOCUMENT>LLVM Compilers on Polaris

This page is not about LLVM-based Cray Compiling Environment (CCE) compilers from PrgEnv-cray but about open source LLVM compilers.

If LLVM compilers are needed without MPI support, simply load the llvm module.

Cray Programming Environment does not offer LLVM compiler support.
Thus cc/CC/ftn compiler wrappers using LLVM compilers currently are not available.
To use Clang with MPI, one can load the mpiwrappers/cray-mpich-llvm module which loads the following modules.

llvm, upstream llvm compilers

cray-mpich, MPI compiler wrappers mpicc/mpicxx/mpif90. mpif90 uses gfortran because flang is not ready for production use.

cray-pals, MPI launchers mpiexec/aprun/mpirun

Limitation There is no GPU-aware MPI library linking support by default. If needed, users should manually add the GTL (GPU Transport Layer) library to the application link line.

Update 04/25/2024 To access LLVM modules, module use /soft/modulefiles is required.

OpenMP offload

When targeting the OpenMP or CUDA programming models for GPUs, the cudatoolkit-standalone module should also be loaded.</DOCUMENT>

User: How do I set up the environment variables for SmartSim?
Assistant: The environment variables for SmartSim are set by exporting SMARTSIM_REDISAI=1.2.7, CC=cc, CXX=CC, CUDA_DEPS_BASE=/soft/libraries, and the various CUDA and CUDNN version-related variables.

"System: This is a chat between a user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions based on the context. The assistant should also indicate when the answer cannot be found in the context.
Context: <DOCUMENT>Compilers provided by Cray Programming Environments

The default programming environment on Polaris is currently NVHPC. The GNU compilers are available via another programming environment. The following sequence of module commands can be used to switch to the GNU programming environment (gcc, g++, gfortran) and also have NVIDIA compilers available in your path.

module swap PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-gnu
module load nvhpc-mixed

The compilers invoked by the Cray MPI wrappers are listed for each programming environment in the following table.

module C C++ Fortran MPI Compiler Wrapper cc CC ftn PrgEnv-nvhpc nvc nvc++ nvfortran PrgEnv-gnu gcc g++ gfortran

Note, while gcc and g++ may be available in the default environment, the PrgEnv-gnu module is needed to provide gfortran.

Additional Compilers Provided by ALCF

The ALCF additionally provides compilers to enable the OpenMP and SYCL programming models for GPUs viaLLVM as documented here

Additional documentation for using compilers is available on the respective programming model pages: OpenMP and SYCL.

Linking

Dynamic linking of libraries is currently the default on Polaris. The Cray MPI wrappers will handle this automatically.

Notes on Default Modules

craype-x86-rome: While the Polaris compute nodes currently have Milan CPUs, this module is loaded by default to avoid the craype-x86-milan module from adding a zen3 target not supported in the default nvhpc/21.9 compilers. The craype-x86-milan module is expected to be made default once a newer nvhpc version (e.g. 22.5) is made the default.

craype-accel-nvidia80: This module adds compiler flags to enable GPU acceleration for NVHPC compilers along with gpu-enabled MPI libraries as it is assumed that the majority of applications to be compiled on Polaris will target the GPUs for acceleration. Users building cpu-only applications may find it useful to unload this module to silence ""gpu code generation"" warnings.

<DOCUMENT>libEnsemble

libEnsemble is a Python toolkit for running dynamic ensembles of calculations.

Users provide generator and simulator functions to express their ensembles, where the generator can steer the ensemble based on previous results. These functions can portably submit external executables at any scale.

System details are detected, and dynamic resource management is provided. This includes automatically detecting, assigning, and reassigning
GPUs for ensemble members.

libEnsemble can be used in a consistent manner on laptops, clusters, and supercomputers with minimal required dependencies.

Getting libEnsemble on Polaris

libEnsemble is provided on Polaris in the conda module:

See the docs for more details on using python on Polaris.

libEnsemble examples

For a very simple example of using libEnsemble see the Simple Introduction tutorial

For an example that runs a small ensemble using a C application (offloading work to the GPU), see
the GPU app tutorial.
The required files for this tutorial can be found
in this directory.
A video demo is also available.

Job Submission

libEnsemble runs on the compute nodes on Polaris using either Python's
multiprocessing or mpi4py. The user can set the number of workers for
maximum concurrency. libEnsemble will detect the nodes available
from the PBS environment and use these for running simulations. Polaris supports
running multiple concurrent simulations on each node if desired.

A simple example batch script for a libEnsemble use case that runs five workers on one node:

```shell
    #!/bin/bash -l
    #PBS -l select=1:system=polaris
    #PBS -l walltime=00:15:00
    #PBS -l filesystems=home:grand
    #PBS -q debug
    #PBS -A

```

The script can be run with:

If the application instead relies on the job launcher to bind MPI ranks to available GPUs, then a small helper script can be used to explicitly setCUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` appropriately for each MPI rank. One example is available here where each MPI rank is similarly bound to a single GPU with round-robin assignment. The binding of MPI ranks to GPUs is discussed in more detail here.

GPU OpenCL

A simple OpenCL example is available here. The OpenCL headers and library are available in the NVHPC SDK and cuda toolkits. The environment variable NVIDIA_PATH is defined for the PrgEnv-nvhpc programming environment. 
CC -o vecadd -g -O3 -std=c++0x  -I${NVIDIA_PATH}/cuda/include main.o -L${NVIDIA_PATH}/cuda/lib64 -lOpenCL

This simple example can be run on a Polaris compute node as follows.
```
$ ./vecadd
Running on GPU!
Using single-precision

Result is CORRECT!! :)
```

GPU OpenMP

A simple MPI-parallel OpenMP example is available here. Compilation proceeds similar to the above examples except for use of the -mp=gpu compiler flag to indicated compilation of OpenMP code for GPUs.

CC -g -O3 -std=c++0x -mp=gpu -gpu=cc80,cuda11.0 -c main.cpp -o vecadd

Similar to the OpenACC example above, this code binds MPI ranks to GPUs in a round-robin fashion. 
```
$ mpiexec -n 4 ./vecadd

of devices= 4

Rank 0 running on GPU 0!
Rank 1 running on GPU 1!
Rank 2 running on GPU 2!
Rank 3 running on GPU 3!

<DOCUMENT>TensorFlow on Polaris

TensorFlow is a popular, open-source deep learning framework developed and released by Google.  The TensorFlow home page has more information about TensorFlow, which you can refer to.  For trouble shooting on Polaris, please contact support@alcf.anl.gov.

Installation on Polaris

TensorFlow is already pre-installed on Polaris, available in the conda module.  To use it from a compute node, please do:

bash
module load conda
conda activate

Then, you can load TensorFlow in python as usual (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):

```python

import tensorflow as tf
tf.version
'2.9.1'

```

This installation of TensorFlow was built from source and the CUDA libraries it uses are found via the CUDA_HOME environment variable (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):

bash
$ echo $CUDA_HOME
/soft/datascience/cuda/cuda_11.5.2_495.29.05_linux

If you need to build applications that use this version of TensorFlow and CUDA, we recommend using these cuda libraries to ensure compatibility.  We periodically update the TensorFlow release, though updates will come in the form of new versions of the conda module.

TensorFlow is also available through NVIDIA containers that have been translated to Singularity containers.  For more information about containers, please see the Containers documentation page.

TensorFlow Best Practices on Polaris

Single Node Performance

When running TensorFlow applications, we have found the following practices to be generally, if not universally, useful and encourage you to try some of these techniques to boost performance of your own applications.

Use Reduced Precision. Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with TensorFlow operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the tf.keras.mixed_precision Policy, as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  If you use a custom training loop (and not keras.Model.fit), you will also need to apply loss scaling.</DOCUMENT>

<DOCUMENT>Notes

SmartSim workflows, such as online training, often require launching multiple MPI applications on the same set of nodes. On Polaris, the MPICH_OFI_CXI_PID_BASE=0 must be exported before the first call to mpiexec, and then incremented by 1 and re-exported before each successive call. This is done with the SmartSim API by adding env_vars={'MPICH_OFI_CXI_PID_BASE':str(0)} to the PalsMpiexecSettings() API.</DOCUMENT>

User: What is the purpose of exporting MPICH_OFI_CXI_PID_BASE in SmartSim workflows?

GPU Support

NVIDIA GPU support is provided through the CUDA.jl package. The default in Julia is to download artifacts (e.g. CUDA toolkit) based on the runtime detected. While that should generally work, it is recommended to use the local CUDA installation provided on Polaris especially if using gpu-aware MPI in your workloads (important to use supported versions of CUDA with Cray MPICH provided).

To use the local CUDA installation provided by the modules on Polaris, the LocalPreferences.toml file can be modified as follows.

$ head $JULIA_DEPOT_PATH/environments/v1.10/LocalPreferences.toml
[CUDA_Runtime_jll]
local = true

If using the default PrgEnv-nvhpc module on Polaris, then it will be necessary to correct a path to the CUPTI library to successfully install CUDA.jl.

Using pip install --user (not recommended)

!!! danger

With the conda environment setup, one can install common Python modules using
#!bash python3 pip install --users '<module-name>' which will install
packages in #!bash $PYTHONUSERBASE/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages.

The #!bash $PYTHONUSERBASE environment variable is automatically set when you
load the base conda module, and is equal to  #!bash
/home/$USER/.local/polaris/conda/YYYY-MM-DD.

Note, Python modules installed this way that contain command line binaries will
not have those binaries automatically added to the shell's #!bash $PATH. To
manually add the path:

bash
export PATH=""$PYTHONUSERBASE/bin:$PATH""

Be sure to remove this location from #!bash $PATH if you deactivate the base
Anaconda environment or unload the module.

Cloning the Anaconda environment, or using venv are both more flexible and
transparent when compared to #!bash --user installs.</DOCUMENT>

HDF5 Support

Parallel HDF5 support is provided by
module load cray-hdf5-parallel
After setting export JULIA_HDF5_PATH=$HDF5_DIR we can install the HDF5.jl package.

julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(""HDF5"")'

To remove warning messages indicating that use of JULIA_HDF5_PATH has been deprecated, one can use the following command to set the HDF5 libraries.

```
$ echo $CRAY_HDF5_PARALLEL_PREFIX/
/opt/cray/pe/hdf5-parallel/1.12.2.9/nvidia/23.3

$ julia --project -e 'using HDF5; HDF5.API.set_libraries!(""/opt/cray/pe/hdf5-parallel/1.12.2.9/nvidia/23.3/lib/libhdf5.so"", ""/opt/cray/pe/hdf5-parallel/1.12.2.9/nvidia/23.3/lib/libhdf5_hl.so"")'
```

Quickstart Guide

The following example shows how to use MPI.jl, CUDA.jl, and HDF5.jl to write a
parallel program that computes the sum of two vectors on the GPU and writes the
result to an HDF5 file. A repository with an example code computing an
approximation of pi can be found at
Polaris.jl. In this repository, you will also find
a setup_polaris.sh script that will build the HDF5.jl and MPI.jl package for the system libraries.
The dependencies are installed with the following commands:
bash
julia --project

Differences between nvcc and nvc/nvc++

For users that want to continue using nvcc it is important to be mindful of differences with the newer nvc and nvc++ compilers. For example, the -cuda flag instructs nvcc to compile .cu input files to .cu.cpp.ii output files which are to be separately compiled, whereas the same -cuda flag instructs nvc, nvc++, and nvfortran to enable CUDA C/C++ or CUDA Fortran code generation. The resulting output file in each case is different (text vs. object) and one may see unrecognized format error when -cuda is incorrectly passed to nvcc.

Known Issues and Workarounds

If you are using nvcc to invoke nvc++ and compiling C++17 code, and are seeing the following warning and unable to compile C++17 constructs:

```
polaris-login-01(~)> nvcc --std=c++17 -ccbin nvc++ ~/smalltests/bool_constant.cpp
nvcc warning : The -std=c++17 flag is not supported with the configured host compiler. Flag will be ignored.

<DOCUMENT>[""Parsl on Polaris\n\nParsl is a flexible and scalable parallel programming library for Python.\n\n-- Parsl Documentation\n\nFor many applications, managing an ensemble of jobs into a workflow is a critical step that can easily become a performance bottleneck.  Many tools exist to address this, of which parsl is just one.  On this page, we'll highlight some of the key pieces of information about parsl that are relevant to Polaris.  Parsl is also extensively documented, has a dedicated Slack Channel, and a large community of users and developers beyond ALCF.  We encourage you to engage with the parsl community for support with parsl specific questions, and for Polaris-specific questions or problems, please contact support@alcf.anl.gov.\n\nGetting Parsl on Polaris\n\nYou can install parsl building off of the conda modules.  You have some flexibility in how you want to extend the conda module to include parsl, but here is an example way to do it:\n\n```python\n\nLoad the Conda Module (needed everytime you use parsl)\n\nmodule load conda\nconda activate\n\nCreate a virtual env that uses the conda env as the system packages.\n\nOnly do the next line on initial set up:\n\npython -m venv --system-site-packages /path/to/your/virtualenv\n\nLoad the virtual env (every time):\n\nsource /path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/activate\n\nInstall parsl (only once)\n\npip install parsl\n\n```\n\nUsing Parsl on Polaris\n\nParsl has a variety of possible configuration settings.  As an example, we provide the configuration below that will run one task per GPU:\n\n```python\nfrom parsl.config import Config\n\nPBSPro is the right provider for Polaris:\n\nfrom parsl.providers import PBSProProvider\n\nThe high throughput executor is for scaling to HPC systems:\n\nfrom parsl.executors import HighThroughputExecutor\n\nYou can use the MPI launcher, but may want the Gnu Parallel launcher, see below\n\nfrom parsl.launchers import MpiExecLauncher, GnuParallelLauncher\n\naddress_by_interface is needed for the HighThroughputExecutor:"", 'data/md/polaris/workflows/parsl.md']</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>GNU Compilers on Polaris

The GNU compilers are available on Polaris via the PrgEnv-gnu and gcc-mixed modules. The gcc-mixed module can be useful when, for example, the PrgEnv-nvhpc compilers are used to compile C/C++ MPI-enabled code and gfortran is needed.

The GNU compilers currently on Polaris do not support GPU code generation and thus can only be used for compiling CPU codes.

The nvhpc and llvm compilers can be used for compiling GPU-enabled applications.</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>and launch the ParaView server with

srizzi@x3005c0s7b0n0:~> mpirun -n 8 pvserver --server-port=8000
Waiting for client...
Connection URL: cs://x3005c0s7b0n0:8000
Accepting connection(s): x3005c0s7b0n0:8000

In this case pvserver will be listening on TCP port 8000 of your head node. You can change this port if you want.

Creating a tunnel over ssh

We need to establish an ssh tunnel to connect client to server. On your local machine open a new terminal and type:

ssh -v -N -L 8000:x3005c0s7b0n0:8000 polaris.alcf.anl.gov

where 8000 is a TCP port and x3005c0s7b0n0 the name of your head node. Adjust these values accordingly.

Among multiple lines with debug information,  you should see something like:

debug1: Local connections to LOCALHOST:8000 forwarded to remote address x3005c0s7b0n0:8000

Keep this terminal open for the duration of your session to keep the ssh tunnel active.

Now you are ready to launch your ParaView client locally. Keep in mind that client and servers versions must match. The ParaView version currently deployed on Polaris is 5.12.0

Connecting to ParaView server

Connect your ParaView client to the server configuration you created above. You can select Connect, either from the File menu, or the icon circled in the figure:

and selecting the configuration you created in a previous step.

The connection should point to:

localhost:8000

In the terminal where you launched the server you will see now that the connection is established. Note that ParaView may take a few seconds to connect. This is normal behavior.

username@x3005c0s7b0n0:~> mpirun -n 8 pvserver --server-port=8000
Waiting for client...
Connection URL: cs://x3005c0s7b0n0:8000
Accepting connection(s): x3005c0s7b0n0:8000
Client connected.

At this point you can use ParaView normally.</DOCUMENT>

Context: <DOCUMENT>Python

We provide prebuilt conda environments containing GPU-supported builds of
torch, tensorflow (both with horovod support for multi-node
calculations), jax, and many other commonly-used Python modules.

Users can activate this environment by first loading the conda module, and
then activating the base environment.

Explicitly (either from an interactive job, or inside a job script):

bash
module use /soft/modulefiles; module load conda ; conda activate base

This will load and activate the base environment.

Virtual environments via venv

To install additional packages that are missing from the base environment,
we can build a venv on top of it.

!!! success ""Conda base environment + venv""

You can always retroactively change the #!bash --system-site-packages flag
state for this virtual environment by editing #!bash ${VENV_DIR}/pyvenv.cfg and
changing the value of the line #!bash include-system-site-packages=false.

To install a different version of a package that is already installed in the
base environment, you can use:

bash
python3 pip install --ignore-installed <package> # or -I

The shared base environment is not writable, so it is impossible to remove or
uninstall packages from it. The packages installed with the above pip command
should shadow those installed in the base environment.

Cloning the base Anaconda environment

!!! warning

If you need more flexibility, you can clone the conda environment into a custom
path, which would then allow for root-like installations via #!bash conda install
<module> or #!bash pip install <module>.

Unlike the venv approach, using a cloned Anaconda environment requires you to
copy the entirety of the base environment, which can use significant storage
space.

To clone the base environment:

bash
module load conda ; conda activate base
conda create --clone base --prefix /path/to/envs/base-clone
conda activate /path/to/envs/base-clone

where, #!bash path/to/envs/base-clone should be replaced by a suitably chosen
path.</DOCUMENT>

<DOCUMENT>Balsam

Balsam is a Python-based workflow manager that helps users execute large numbers of jobs, potentially with interjob dependencies, track job outcomes, and manage postprocessing analysis. A Balsam Site runs on a node with access to the job scheduler, where it can submit and monitor jobs. Overall job state is aggregated on the Balsam Server, making job data from all Sites accessible from any individual site (or the user's laptop), via the command-line interface or the Python API. To get information on how to use the command line tool, you can type balsam --help in your shell.

Full documentation for Balsam is available online.

Balsam requires Python 3.7+. To install Balsam on Polaris, first set up a virtual Python environment:

shell
module load conda
conda activate base
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --pre balsam

To use Balsam, users need an account on the Balsam server.  Users can get an account by contacting the ALCF Help Desk.  Once a user has an account, they can login and make a new site.  A Balsam site is a project space for your workflow. You will be prompted to select what machine (Polaris) you are working on when creating a new site:

shell
balsam login
balsam site init -n new-site new-site
cd new-site
balsam site start

See the Balsam documentation for full details.</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Controlling Where Your Job Runs

If you wish to have your job run on specific nodes form your select like this: -l select=1:vnode=<node name1>+1:vnode=<node name2>... . Obviously, that gets tedious for large jobs.

If you want to control the location of a few nodes, for example 2 out of 64, but the rest don't matter, you can do something like this: -l select=1:vnode=<node name1>+1:vnode=<node name2>+62:system=foo

Every node has a PBS resource called tier0 with a rack identifier and tier1 with a dragonfly group identifieer.  If you want all your nodes grouped in a rack, you can add the group specifier -l select=8:system=foo,place=scatter:group=tier0.  If you wanted everything in the same dragonfly group, replace tier0 with tier1.  Note that you have to also explicitly specify the place when you use group.  If you wanted a specific rack or dragonfly group instead of any of them, you are back to the select: -l select 10:tier0=x3001-g0.

Network: Rack and Dragonfly Group Mappings

Racks contain (7) 6U chassis; each chassis has 2 nodes for 14 nodes per rack

The hostnames are of the form xRRPPc0sUUb[0|1]n0 where:
RR is the row {30, 31, 32}
PP is the position in the row {30 goes 1-16, 31 and 32 go 1-12}
c is chassis and is always 0
s stands for slot, but in this case is the RU in the rack and values are {1,7,13,19,25,31,37}
b is BMC controller and is 0 or 1 (each node has its own BMC)
n is node, but is always 0 since there is only one node per BMC

So, 16+12+12 = 40 racks * 14 nodes per rack = 560 nodes.

Note that in production group 9 (the last 4 racks) will be the designated on-demand racks

The management racks are x3000 and X3100 and are dragonfly group 10

The TDS rack is x3200 and is dragonfly group 11</DOCUMENT>

Kokkos

Kokkos Core implements a programming model in C++ for writing performance
portable applications targeting all major HPC platforms. For that purpose it
provides abstractions for both parallel execution of code and data
management. Kokkos is designed to target complex node architectures with
N-level memory hierarchies and multiple types of execution resources. It
currently can use Serial and OpenMP (threads) for CPU execution spaces
(""backends"") and CUDA, HIP, SYCL, and OpenMPTarget for GPU execution
spaces. By convention, Kokkos only allows one GPU backend at a time.

Kokkos Documentation

Kokkos on Polaris

Following the Polaris upgrade to HPCM
1.10,
the module setup to use the prebuilt Kokkos changed.

The prebuilt Kokkos on polaris includes 3 backends: Serial and OpenMP for CPU
execution and CUDA for GPU execution. To use it, run

module load craype-x86-milan
module load craype-accel-nvidia80
module swap PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-gnu
module use /soft/modulefiles
module load cuda-PrgEnv-nvidia/12.2.91
module load kokkos

This sets the following environment variables, some of which are used by
cmake:

KOKKOS_HOME - path to the lib64/, include/ files installed

LIBRARY_PATH - prepends $KOKKOS_HOME/lib64 to this variable used by cmake

CPATH - prepends $KOKKOS_HOME/include to this variable used by cmake

LD_LIBRARY_PATH - prepends $KOKKOS_HOME/lib64 to this variable

Building a Kokkos Application Using cmake

Add these lines to CMakeLists.txt:

find_package(Kokkos REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(myTarget Kokkos::kokkoscore)

Here is a simple example CMakeLists.txt to compile an example program:

```
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.22)

<DOCUMENT>Example Programs and Makefiles for Polaris

Several simple examples of building CPU and GPU-enabled codes on Polaris are available in the ALCF GettingStart repo for several programming models. If build your application is problematic for some reason (e.g. absence of a GPU), then users are encouraged to build and test applications directly on one of the Polaris compute nodes via an interactive job. The discussion below makes use of the NVHPC compilers in the default environment as illustrative examples. Similar examples for other compilers on Polaris are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo.

CPU MPI+OpenMP Example

One of the first useful tasks with any new machine, scheduler, and job launcher is to ensure one is binding MPI ranks and OpenMP threads to the host cpu as intended. A simple HelloWorld MPI+OpenMP example is available here to get started with.

The application can be straightforwardly compiled using the Cray compiler wrappers.
CC -fopenmp main.cpp -o hello_affinity

The executable hello_affinity can then be launched in a job script (or directly in shell of interactive job) using mpiexec as discussed here.

```

!/bin/sh

PBS -l select=1:system=polaris

PBS -l place=scatter

PBS -l walltime=0:30:00

PBS -l filesystems=home

MPI example w/ 16 MPI ranks per node spread evenly across cores

NNODES=wc -l < $PBS_NODEFILE
NRANKS_PER_NODE=16
NDEPTH=4
NTHREADS=1

NTOTRANKS=$(( NNODES * NRANKS_PER_NODE ))
echo ""NUM_OF_NODES= ${NNODES} TOTAL_NUM_RANKS= ${NTOTRANKS} RANKS_PER_NODE= ${NRANKS_PER_NODE} THREADS_PER_RANK= ${NTHREADS}""

mpiexec -n ${NTOTRANKS} --ppn ${NRANKS_PER_NODE} --depth=${NDEPTH} --cpu-bind depth ./hello_affinity
```

CUDA

Several variants of C/C++ and Fortran CUDA examples are available here that include MPI and multi-gpu examples.

One can use the Cray compiler wrappers to compile GPU-enabled applications as well. This example of simple vector addition uses the NVIDIA compilers.

CC -g -O3 -std=c++0x -cuda main.cpp -o vecadd</DOCUMENT>

<DOCUMENT>Polaris System Updates

2024-04-22

The management software on Polaris has been upgraded to HPCM 1.10
The following version changes are in place with the upgrade to HPCM 1.10:

HPE Cray Programming Environment (CPE) 23.12

SlingShot version 2.1.2

NVIDIA SDK 23.9

NVIDIA driver version 535.154.05

CUDA 12.2

SUSE 15 SP5

Releasing jobs

Jobs that were queued before the upgrade have been restored to the appropriate queues but are placed on user hold. 
Jobs are not expected to complete successfully due to the changes made to the system and software environments resulting from the upgrade. 
We recommend you review your jobs and either release the hold (qrls <jobid>) or delete it (qdel <jobid>) and resubmit as appropriate.

Users need to rebuild for the new PE environment and major OS upgrade. Existing binaries are unlikely to run successfully.

We have held all jobs submitted prior to the upgrade as a user hold. Users may release their existing jobs with qrls to run after they have rebuilt their binaries.

PBS does cache the job execution script.  If a change to the script is required due to a path changing post rebuild, the job will have to be resubmitted.

All application binaries should be rebuilt prior to further job submissions.

Re-building user codes

Many user codes will need to be re-built and/or re-linked against the newer version of the programming environment (23.12) and Spack provided dependencies.

Changes to the user software environment

In addition to the system upgrades, several changes have been made to the user
software environment which may impact user workflows.

Older PE versions removed

Older versions of the Cray PE (older than 23.12) are deprecated as they are incompatible with the
upgraded system stack and are no longer available for use.

Context: <DOCUMENT>Known Issues

This is a collection of known issues that have been encountered on Polaris. Documentation will be updated as issues are resolved. Users are encouraged to email support@alcf.anl.gov to report issues.

Submitting Jobs

For batch job submissions, if the parameters within your submission script do not meet the parameters of any of the execution queues (small, ..., backfill-large) you might not receive the ""Job submission"" error on the command line at all, and the job will never appear in history qstat -xu <username> (current bug in PBS). E.g. if a user submits a script to the prod routing queue requesting 10 nodes for 24 hours, exceeding ""Time Max"" of 6 hrs of the small execution queue (which handles jobs with 10-24 nodes), then it may behave as if the job was never submitted.

Job scripts are copied to temporary locations after qsub and any changes to the original script while the job is queued will not be reflected in the copied script. Furthermore, qalter requires -A <allocation name> when changing job properties. Currently, there is a request for a qalter-like command to trigger a re-copy of the original script to the temporary location.

Compiling & Running Applications

If your job fails to start with an RPC launch message like below, please forward the complete messages to support@alcf.anl.gov.

bash
   launch failed on x3104c0s1b0n0: Couldn't forward RPC launch(ab751d77-e80a-4c54-b1c2-4e881f7e8c90) to child x3104c0s31b0n0.hsn.cm.polaris.alcf.anl.gov: Resource temporarily unavailable</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>8. Data Representation: Opacity

Even with the continuum data represented as wireframe, there is still considerable occlusion of the interior structures. In order to further reduce this occlusion by the wireframe, we can make it more transparent.

Again, be sure that the continuum.000*data is selected in the Pipeline Browser

In the Object Inspector make sure the Display tab is selected

In the Object Inspector there is a section titled Style

Set Opacity to 0.2

9. Animating Simulation Data

Since our data has multiple time steps, we can easily animate through them to see how the data changes over time.

Simply click the Play button on the animation bar at the top of the GUI

Pause to make it stop

Loop: With this button toggled on, animation will repeat until stopped

10. Animations

Animations can be saved to disk as a movie file, to be played back later.

From the main menu: File->Save Animation

Animation Settings Dialog: Save Animation

Files of type: AVI files (*.avi)

Enter a name in File name:

Click OK

Movie can be played back with standard media players (Windows Media Player, QuickTime, VLC, etc.)

11. Particles as Glyphs

Glyphs are another way of visually representing data where the attributes of a graphical element are dictated by attributes of the data.

All of the particles are displayed as red points in the graphics window. There are ~39K particles in this particular data set, which makes the display a bit cluttered. In order to both filter some of these out, and create 3D representations for them, let's apply a glyph filter to this data.

Now let's add some of our other data back into the scene. Let's start with the particle data.

In order to both filter some of these out, and create 3D representations for them, we will apply the glyph filter to this data.</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>ParaView and Visit

ParaView module has been updated. For more information, see https://docs.alcf.anl.gov/polaris/visualization/paraview/ and https://docs.alcf.anl.gov/polaris/visualization/paraview-manual-launch/

Visit module is in the process of being updated.

Changes to Memory Limits on Login Nodes

Memory limits were lowered on the logins due to resource contention to 8GB of memory, and 8 cores per user. 
This might result in error messages indicating abnormal process termination for user processes run on logins.

Examples of the error messages people might see are:

nvcc error   : 'cudafe++' died due to signal 9 (Kill signal)

g++-12: fatal error: Killed signal terminated program cc1plus

These errors are likely due to exhausting the per-user resources on a login node as each user is allocated 8 cores and 8GB memory.
To avoid this you can either:

Reduce the parallelism of your compile, such as using -j or -j4 flags

Request a debug node and run your compile there where you will have the full resources of the node at your disposal</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Parsl on Polaris

Parsl is a flexible and scalable parallel programming library for Python.

-- Parsl Documentation

For many applications, managing an ensemble of jobs into a workflow is a critical step that can easily become a performance bottleneck.  Many tools exist to address this, of which parsl is just one.  On this page, we'll highlight some of the key pieces of information about parsl that are relevant to Polaris.  Parsl is also extensively documented, has a dedicated Slack Channel, and a large community of users and developers beyond ALCF.  We encourage you to engage with the parsl community for support with parsl specific questions, and for Polaris-specific questions or problems, please contact support@alcf.anl.gov.

Getting Parsl on Polaris

You can install parsl building off of the conda modules.  You have some flexibility in how you want to extend the conda module to include parsl, but here is an example way to do it:

```python

Load the Conda Module (needed everytime you use parsl)

module load conda
conda activate

Create a virtual env that uses the conda env as the system packages.

Only do the next line on initial set up:

python -m venv --system-site-packages /path/to/your/virtualenv

Load the virtual env (every time):

source /path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/activate

Install parsl (only once)

pip install parsl

```

Using Parsl on Polaris

Parsl has a variety of possible configuration settings.  As an example, we provide the configuration below that will run one task per GPU:

```python
from parsl.config import Config

PBSPro is the right provider for Polaris:

from parsl.providers import PBSProProvider

The high throughput executor is for scaling to HPC systems:

from parsl.executors import HighThroughputExecutor

You can use the MPI launcher, but may want the Gnu Parallel launcher, see below

from parsl.launchers import MpiExecLauncher, GnuParallelLauncher

address_by_interface is needed for the HighThroughputExecutor:</DOCUMENT>

User: What configuration settings are available in Parsl for Polaris?

<DOCUMENT>3. Use ParaView

After the previous step, you can now select POLARIS@ANL in the File->Connect menu and press Connect

At this point a new window will pop up

There are a number of parameters that you must enter manually here:

Xterm executable: the path of a terminal on your system. The figure shows the case of a Mac with XQuartz. You may need to change these values for Windows or Linux.

SSH executable: the name of your ssh command. It may be different on Windows depending on the ssh client installed (i.e putty)

Remote machine: leave this value at polaris.alcf.anl.gov

Username: your ALCF user name

ParaView version: the version of Paraview that you want to use. Verify first that this version is installed on the system (as described at the top of this document). You will also need to add a -EGL suffix.

Example:
5.12.0-EGL

Client port: it is safe to use the default value

Server port: is is safe to use the default value

Number of nodes to reserve: enter the number of Polaris compute nodes you want to use for your job

Number of ranks per node: enter the number of ranks per node

Number of minutes to reserve: the duration of your job in minutes

Account: enter here the name of your ALCF allocation

Queue: the name of the Polaris queue you would like to use (i.e: debug for small, quick jobs, prod, preemptable)

File Systems: enter here the file systems you need for your job, separated with colons, no spaces. Keep in mind that your job may not run if one of these file systems is not available at that time, so enter these values carefully

Job name: safe to use default value. The PBS scheduler will assign this name to your job

Now you can press OK to establish the connection with a ParaView server on Polaris.

An ssh connection will be established with a Polaris login node and a password will be requested in a terminal, similar to the process you normally use to connect and work on the system.</DOCUMENT>

<DOCUMENT>JAX

JAX is another popular python package for accelerated computing.  JAX is built on XLA (the same XLA TensorFlow uses) as well as AutoGrad, and additionally has acceleration tools that operate on functions such as vmap, jit, etc.  JAX is not as widespread in machine learning as TensorFlow and PyTorch for traditional models (Computer Vision, Language Models) though it is quickly gaining promienence.  JAX is very powerful when a program needs non-traditional autodifferentiation or vectorizatoin, such as: forward-mode AD, higher order derivatives, Jacobians, Hessians, or any combination of the above.  Users of JAX on Polaris are encouraged to read the user documentation in detail, particularly the details about pure-functional programming, no in-place operations, and the common mistakes in writing functions for the @jit decorator.

JAX on Polaris

JAX is installed on Polaris via the conda module, available with:
bash
module load conda; conda activate

Then, you can load JAX in python as usual (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):

```python

import jax
jax.version
'0.3.15'

```

Notes on JAX 0.3.15

On Polaris, due to a bug, an environment variable must be set to use JAX on GPUs.  The following code will crash:
python
import jax.numpy as numpy
a = numpy.zeros(1000)
outputting an error that looks like:
python
jaxlib.xla_extension.XlaRuntimeError: UNKNOWN: no kernel image is available for execution on the device

You can fix this by setting an environment variable:
bash
export XLA_FLAGS=""--xla_gpu_force_compilation_parallelism=1""

Scaling JAX to multiple GPUs and multiple Nodes

Jax has intrinsic scaling tools to use multiple GPUs on a single node, via the pmap function.  If this is sufficient for your needs, excellent.  If not, another alternative is to use the newer package mpi4jax.</DOCUMENT>

Context: <DOCUMENT>Use TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.  Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.  When possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention.

Use XLA compilation on your code.  XLA is the Accelerated Linear Algebra library that is available in tensorFlow and critical in software like JAX.  XLA will compile a tf.Graph object, generated with tf.function or similar, and perform optimizations like operation-fusion.  XLA can give impressive performance boosts with almost no user changes except to set an environment variable TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2.  If your code is complex, or has dynamically sized tensors (tensors where the shape changes every iteration), XLA can be detrimental: the overhead for compiling functions can be large enough to mitigate performance improvements.  XLA is particularly powerful when combined with reduced precision, yielding speedups > 100% in some models.

Multi-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up

TensorFlow is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with tensorFlow has been seen with horovod in particular.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation.  Some polaris specific details that may be helpful to you:

CPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.  In particular, we encourage users to try their scaling measurements with the following settings:

<DOCUMENT>NVIDIA Compilers on Polaris

The NVIDIA compilers (nvc, nvc++, nvcc, and nvfortran) are available on Polaris via the PrgEnv-nvhpc and nvhpc modules. There is currently a PrgEnv-nvidia module available, but that will soon be deprecated in Cray's PE, thus it is not recommend for use.

The Cray compiler wrappers map to NVIDIA compilers as follows.

cc -> nvc
CC -> nvc++
ftn -> nvfortran

Users are encouraged to look through NVIDIA's documentation for the NVHPC SDK and specific information on the compilers, tools, and libraries.

Notes on NVIDIA Compilers

PGI compilers

The NVIDIA programming environments makes available compilers from the NVIDIA HPC SDK. While the PGI compilers are available in this programming environment, it should be noted they are actually symlinks to the corresponding NVIDIA compilers.
pgcc -> nvc
pgc++ -> nvc++
pgf90 -> nvfortran
pgfortran -> nvfortran
While nvcc is the traditional CUDA C and CUDA C++ compiler for NVIDIA GPUs, the nvc, nvc++, and nvfortran compilers additionally target CPUs.

NVHPC SDK Directory Structure

Users migrating from CUDA toolkits to the NVHPC SDK may find it beneficial to review the directory structure of the hpc-sdk directory to find the location of commonly used libraries (including math libraries for the CPU). With the PrgEnv-nvhpc module loaded, the NVIDIA_PATH environment variable can be used to locate the path to various NVIDIA tools, libraries, and examples.

<DOCUMENT>Use TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.  Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.  When possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention.

Use XLA compilation on your code.  XLA is the Accelerated Linear Algebra library that is available in tensorFlow and critical in software like JAX.  XLA will compile a tf.Graph object, generated with tf.function or similar, and perform optimizations like operation-fusion.  XLA can give impressive performance boosts with almost no user changes except to set an environment variable TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2.  If your code is complex, or has dynamically sized tensors (tensors where the shape changes every iteration), XLA can be detrimental: the overhead for compiling functions can be large enough to mitigate performance improvements.  XLA is particularly powerful when combined with reduced precision, yielding speedups > 100% in some models.

Multi-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up

TensorFlow is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with tensorFlow has been seen with horovod in particular.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation.  Some polaris specific details that may be helpful to you:

CPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.  In particular, we encourage users to try their scaling measurements with the following settings:

Set the environment variable NCCL_COLLNET_ENABLE=1</DOCUMENT>

User: How can one adjust user-specific options in Parsl?
Assistant: Adjust user-specific options by modifying the values assigned to each key in the `user_opts` dictionary.

Context: <DOCUMENT>Use Reduced Precision. Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with PyTorch operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the PyTorch Automatic Mixed Precision package (AMP), as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  In PyTorch, users generally need to manage casting and loss scaling manually,  though context managers and function decorators can provide easy tools to do this.

PyTorch has a JIT module as well as backends to support op fusion, similar to TensorFlow's tf.function tools.  However, PyTorch JIT capabilities are newer and may not yield performance improvements.  Please see TorchScript for more information.

Multi-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up

PyTorch is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with PyTorch has been seen with both DDP and Horovod.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation or the Distributed Data Parallel documentation.  Some Polaris-specific details that may be helpful to you:

   spack-pe-base/0.6.1
   spack-pe-gnu/0.6.1

Note that spack-pe-base and spack-pe-gnu are metamodules which contain
further software offerings. See the Spack section below for details.

Spack

We have newly installed Spack deployments in /soft. Spack is an HPC-oriented
package manager which ALCF uses to install software for the user environment.
However, no knowledge of Spack is necessary to use these software offerings. All
ALCF-managed software is accessible to users via modules.

The base suite of software tools and libraries can be accessed by loading the
spack-pe-base module. This adds a path to $MODULEPATH which contains
numerous modules.

For example, to load cmake starting from the default environment, a user
should run the following commands:
module use /soft/modulefiles
module load spack-pe-base
module load cmake
Other modules in spack-pe-base can be browsed by running module avail or
module --show-hidden avail. The latter shows hidden modules which are
installed as dependencies of the un-hidden modules.

In addition to the base stack, a suite of higher-level libraries are installed
in the spack-pe-gnu module. These are built with and are dependent on
PrgEnv-gnu. A PrgEnv-nvidia-compatible stack will be available in the
future.

Note that not all software is installed through Spack; many applications and
libraries are installed as standalone packages in /soft. Users are encouraged
to browse the available modules with module avail to see what software is
installed on the system.

With the appropriate LAMMPS Makefile in place an executable can be compiled as in the following example. Note, per-user limits on the login nodes will reduce the maximum parallelism for compilation. Users are encouraged to compile on a compute node in an interactive session if necessary.

cd lammps-<version>/src

KOKKOS package and NVHPC compilers

The following modules are useful for this particular build. Note, the cmake module is not required if using the GNU Makefile procedure to build LAMMPS. The initial module restore is just setting the default environment as the starting point. Users may find it useful to copy these module commands into a small helper script to assist with compiling and running LAMMPS (e.g. setup_lammps_nvhpc.sh).</DOCUMENT>

Julia Project Environment

The Julia built-in package manager allows you to create a project and enable
project-specific dependencies. Julia manages packages in the Julia depot located
by default in ~/.julia. However, that NFS filesystem is not meant for
high-speed access. Therefore, this Julia depot folder should be located on a
fast filesystem of your choice (grand, eagle). The Julia depot directory is
set via the environment variable JULIA_DEPOT_PATH. For example, you can set
the Julia depot to a directory on Polaris grand filesystem by adding the following line
to your ~/.bashrc file:

bash
export JULIA_DEPOT_PATH=/grand/$PROJECT/$USER/julia_depot

Programming Julia on Polaris

There are three key components to using Julia for large-scale computations:

MPI support through MPI.jl

GPU support through CUDA.jl

HDF5 support through HDF5.jl

In addition, we recommend VSCode with the Julia
extension for a modern IDE experience, together
with the ssh-remote extension for remote interactive development.

MPI Support

MPI support is provided through the MPI.jl.
bash
$ julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(""MPI"")'
This will install the MPI.jl package and default MPI prebuilt binaries provided by an artifact. For on-node debugging purposes the default artifact is sufficient. However, for large-scale computations, it is important to use the Cray MPICH installed on Polaris. As of MPI.jl v0.20 this is handled through MPIPrefences.jl.
$ julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(""MPIPreferences"")'
$ julia --project -e 'using MPIPreferences; MPIPreferences.use_system_binary(vendor=""cray"")'

The vendor=""cray"" option is important if you intend to use gpu-aware MPI in your applications.

Check that the correct MPI library is targeted with Julia.

<DOCUMENT>Note: that the particles.000* is still visible.

Unhide the particles.000*data: click Eye icon

Select particles.000*data: click on name

Filters->Alphabetical->Glyph or click on the Glyph icon from the menu bar

Glyph Type: Sphere

Radius:. 0.15

Orient: Unchecked

Scale Mode: off

Set Scale Factor: 1 - Edit: Checked

Maximum Number of Points: 3000

Mask Points: Checked

Random Mode: Unchecked

Click the Apply button

Since our goal was to unclutter the display, let's hide the particles.000*by toggling them off, by clicking on the Eye icon next to it in the Pipeline Browser

Let's also switch to the Display tab in the Object Inspector, with Glyph1 selected, and change the Color by value to GlyphVector. Since the GlyphVector value is based on the velocity. We can Edit Color Map...and choose the same Blue to Red Rainbow preset that we previously chose for velocity

12. Enter: Red Blood Cells

Now let's add in both of the other data sets, which are polygonal meshes which make up Red Blood Cells (RBCs).

These two data sets are essentially the same kind of data, so we can apply the same filters and make the same types of representation changes to each of them. However, some of the RBCs are marked by the simulation that generated them as healthy (rbc.000) and some of them are marked as diseased (bad_rbc.000).

Unhide the rbc.000 and bad_rbc.000 data sets by clicking the Eye icon next to each of them to make them visible

13. Using Color to Differentiate Data

To enable us to distinguish these two types of data from one other, we can vary their representations.

One way to do this is by setting the color of the two data sets to different colors. Repeat this process for each of rbc.000 and bad_rbc.000, picking different colors.

Select one of the rbc data sets in the Pipeline Browser

Go to the Displaytab in the Object Inspector

In the Color by:dropdown select Solid Color

Click on the Set Solid Color... button

Select a color from the Select Colordialog that appears</DOCUMENT>

GPU Support

NVIDIA GPU support is provided through the CUDA.jl package. The default in Julia is to download artifacts (e.g. CUDA toolkit) based on the runtime detected. While that should generally work, it is recommended to use the local CUDA installation provided on Polaris especially if using gpu-aware MPI in your workloads (important to use supported versions of CUDA with Cray MPICH provided).

To use the local CUDA installation provided by the modules on Polaris, the LocalPreferences.toml file can be modified as follows.

$ head $JULIA_DEPOT_PATH/environments/v1.10/LocalPreferences.toml
[CUDA_Runtime_jll]
local = true

If using the default PrgEnv-nvhpc module on Polaris, then it will be necessary to correct a path to the CUPTI library to successfully install CUDA.jl.

$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$CRAY_NVIDIA_PREFIX/cuda/12.2/extras/CUPTI/lib64/
$ julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(""CUDA"")'

The GPUs are not currently usable on the Polaris login nodes, so one can confirm the version of CUDA being used by testing in a batch or interactive job on a compute node.

<DOCUMENT>and launch the ParaView server with

srizzi@x3005c0s7b0n0:~> mpirun -n 8 pvserver --server-port=8000
Waiting for client...
Connection URL: cs://x3005c0s7b0n0:8000
Accepting connection(s): x3005c0s7b0n0:8000

In this case pvserver will be listening on TCP port 8000 of your head node. You can change this port if you want.

Creating a tunnel over ssh

We need to establish an ssh tunnel to connect client to server. On your local machine open a new terminal and type:

ssh -v -N -L 8000:x3005c0s7b0n0:8000 polaris.alcf.anl.gov

where 8000 is a TCP port and x3005c0s7b0n0 the name of your head node. Adjust these values accordingly.

Among multiple lines with debug information,  you should see something like:

debug1: Local connections to LOCALHOST:8000 forwarded to remote address x3005c0s7b0n0:8000

Keep this terminal open for the duration of your session to keep the ssh tunnel active.

Now you are ready to launch your ParaView client locally. Keep in mind that client and servers versions must match. The ParaView version currently deployed on Polaris is 5.12.0

Connecting to ParaView server

Connect your ParaView client to the server configuration you created above. You can select Connect, either from the File menu, or the icon circled in the figure:

and selecting the configuration you created in a previous step.

The connection should point to:

localhost:8000

In the terminal where you launched the server you will see now that the connection is established. Note that ParaView may take a few seconds to connect. This is normal behavior.

username@x3005c0s7b0n0:~> mpirun -n 8 pvserver --server-port=8000
Waiting for client...
Connection URL: cs://x3005c0s7b0n0:8000
Accepting connection(s): x3005c0s7b0n0:8000
Client connected.

At this point you can use ParaView normally.</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>CCE Compilers on Polaris

The GNU compilers are available on Polaris via the PrgEnv-gnu and gcc-mixed modules. The gcc-mixed module can be useful when, for example, the PrgEnv-nvhpc compilers are used to compile C/C++ MPI-enabled code and gfortran is needed.

The GNU compilers currently on Polaris do not support GPU code generation and thus can only be used for compiling CPU codes.

The nvhpc and llvm compilers can be used for compiling GPU-enabled applications.</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>```

Special notes for Polaris

On Polaris, there is a known bug where python applications launched with mpi and that use fork to spawn processes can sometimes have unexplaned hangs.  For this reason, it is recommended to use start_method=""spawn"" on Polaris when using the MpiExecLauncher as is shown in the example config above.  Alternatively, another solution is to use the GNUParallelLauncher which uses GNU Parallel to spawn processes.  GNU Parallel can be loaded in your environment with the command module load gnu-parallel.  Both of these approaches will circumvent the hang issue from using fork.

Updates

For parsl versions after July 2023, the address passed in the HighThroughputExecutor needs to be set to address = address_by_interface(""bond0"").  With parsl versions prior to July 2023, it was recommended to use address = address_by_hostname() on Polaris, but with later versions this will not work on Polaris (or any other machine).</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Math Libraries

BLAS, LAPACK, and ScaLAPACK for CPUs

Some math libraries targeting CPUs are made available as part of the nvhpc modules and are based on the OpenBLAS project. Additional documentation is available from NVIDIA.

BLAS & LAPACK can be found in the $NVIDIA_PATH/compilers/lib directory.

ScaLAPACK can be found in the $NVIDIA_PATH/comm_libs directory.

GNU Scientific Library, GSL-2.7 available as module help math_libs/gsl

<DOCUMENT>This variable can be used to inspect software installations and find header or
library paths. Additionally, Spack packages have a .spack directory in the
installation prefix which contains build information and logs.

Building software with Spack

Spack is a powerful package manager designed for HPC.
The Spack PE is installed and managed with Spack; users can also install Spack
in their own home or project directory to manage their software builds. Spack
has a steep learning curve, but it may benefit workflows involving frequent
builds with complex dependencies.

For users who wish to use Spack to install their own software, we provide
configuration files corresponding to the Spack PE deployments. These
configuration files can be found in config directories in /soft/spack within
the respective Spack PE installation directories. For example, the
spack-pe-base/0.6.1 configurations are in /soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/config. Not
all of these settings will be useful for all builds and it is not recommended to
adopt these wholesale as global settings. The recommended method is to include
these settings ad hoc in a spack environment to control what information spack
uses for its builds.

Support requests and feedback should be directed to
support@alcf.anl.gov. For general Spack
questions, users are encouraged to consult the following resources:

<DOCUMENT>OpenMP

Overview

The OpenMP API is an open standard for parallel programming. The specification document can be found here: https://www.openmp.org. The specification describes directives, runtime routines, and environment variables that allow an application developer to express parallelism (e.g. shared memory multiprocessing and device offloading). Many compiler vendors provide implementations of the OpenMP specification (https://www.openmp.org/specifications).

Setting the environment to use OpenMP on Polaris

Many of the programming environments available on Polaris have OpenMP support.

module OpenMP CPU support? OpenMP GPU support? PrgEnv-nvhpc yes yes llvm yes yes PrgEnv-gnu yes no PrgEnv-cray yes yes*

Currently PrgEnv-cray is not recommended for OpenMP offload.

By default, the PrgEnv-nvhpc module is loaded. To switch to other modules, you can use module switch.

Using PrgEnv-nvhpc

This is loaded by default, so there's no need to load additional modules. You can confirm that it is loaded by running module list to check that PrgEnv-nvhpc is in the list.

Using LLVM

To use the LLVM module, load the following.
module load mpiwrappers/cray-mpich-llvm
module load cudatoolkit-standalone

See the the LLVM compiling page here for more information.

Using PrgEnv-gnu

To switch from PrgEnv-nvhpc to PrgEnv-gnu you can run:

module switch PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-gnu

The gcc/gfortran on Polaris was not built with GPU support. To use OpenMP on the CPU, you need to unload craype-accel-nvidia80:

module unload craype-accel-nvidia80

Using PrgEnv-cray

To switch from PrgEnv-nvhpc to PrgEnv-cray you can run:

module switch PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-cray

To use OpenMP on the CPU only, also unload craype-accel-nvidia80:

module unload craype-accel-nvidia80

To use OpenMP on the GPU, load cudatoolkit-standalone, although this is not recommended at the moment.
module load cudatoolkit-standalone

Context: <DOCUMENT>Julia

Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for
technical computing. It has a syntax familiar to users of many other
technical computing environments. Designed at MIT to tackle large-scale
partial-differential equation simulation and distributed linear algebra, Julia
features a robust ecosystem of tools for
optimization,
statistics, parallel programming, and data
visualization. Julia is actively developed by the Julia
Labs team at MIT and in
industry, along with hundreds of domain-expert
scientists and programmers worldwide.

This guide is a first draft of the Julia documentation for Polaris. If you have any
suggestions or contributions, please open a pull request or contact us by
opening a ticket at the ALCF Helpdesk.

Julia Installation

We encourage users interested in using Julia on Polaris to install in their home or project directories at this time. Using the official Julia 1.9 binaries from the Julia
webpage is recommended.
Juliaup provides a convenient way to
install Julia and manage the various Julia versions. The default installation will install julia, juliaup, and other commands in a ${HOME}/.julia directory and update profile files like .bashrc to update PATH to include that directory. One can customize the installation to change these defaults.

bash
module load craype-accel-nvidia80
curl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh

If you chose a custom installation, then be sure to update the PATH environment variable appropriately.

export PATH=${HOME}/.juliaup/bin:${PATH}

You may then list the available Julia versions with juliaup list and install a
specific version with juliaup install <version>. You can then activate a
specific version with juliaup use <version> and set the default version with
juliaup default <version>. juliaup update will update the installed Julia
versions. In general, the latest stable release of Julia should be used.

bash
juliaup add release

Special notes for Polaris

On Polaris, there is a known bug where python applications launched with mpi and that use fork to spawn processes can sometimes have unexplaned hangs.  For this reason, it is recommended to use start_method=""spawn"" on Polaris when using the MpiExecLauncher as is shown in the example config above.  Alternatively, another solution is to use the GNUParallelLauncher which uses GNU Parallel to spawn processes.  GNU Parallel can be loaded in your environment with the command module load gnu-parallel.  Both of these approaches will circumvent the hang issue from using fork.

Updates

For parsl versions after July 2023, the address passed in the HighThroughputExecutor needs to be set to address = address_by_interface(""bond0"").  With parsl versions prior to July 2023, it was recommended to use address = address_by_hostname() on Polaris, but with later versions this will not work on Polaris (or any other machine).</DOCUMENT>

export JULIA_MPI_PATH=${CRAY_MPICH_DIR}
export JULIA_MPI_HAS_CUDA=1

export TMPDIR=/local/scratch

Temporary workaround

export LD_PRELOAD=libmpi_gtl_cuda.so
```

Verify that JULIA_DEPOT_PATH is set to the correct path and JULIA_PATH
points to the Julia executable. When using juliaup, the Julia executable is
located in the juliaup folder of your JULIA_DEPOT_PATH.

Large-scale parallelism

CUDA.jl uses the nvcc compiler to compile GPU kernels. This will create object files in the TEMP filesystem. The default TMPDIR in a job on Polaris is set to a temp directory that only exists on the head node of a job. We recommend setting TEMPDIR to a local directory on each compute node.
bash
export TMPDIR=/local/scratch

A simple example to test gpu-aware MPI on multiple nodes is available here.</DOCUMENT>

Building a Kokkos Application Using make

Here's an example Makefile:

KOKKOS_HOME set via:

module load kokkos

You can look at the first lines of $KOKKOS_HOME/KokkosConfigCommon.cmake to

see the flags used in cmake configuration of the kokkos library build. The

default Kokkos module on Polaris was built with PrgEnv-nvhpc and includes

Serial, OpenMP (threads) and CUDA backends. So you should have that

environment module loaded and include compiler flags for cuda and openmp:

Cray MPI wrapper for C++ and C compilers:

CXX=CC
CC=cc

CPPFLAGS=-cuda -fopenmp
LDFLAGS=

LDFLAGS=$(CPPFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS)
LDLIBS=-L$(KOKKOS_HOME)/lib64 -lkokkoscore -lkokkossimd -lpthread

Configuring Your Own Kokkos Build on Polaris

Here are recommended environment settings and configuration to build your own
kokkos libraries on Polaris:

Environment

To match what was done in the centrally-built kokkos associated with the
modules discussed above, use the programming environment
PrgEnv-gnu, and use the Cray wrapper CC as the C++ compiler. You'll also
need to explicitly load the Cuda toolkit version 12.2.91 as shown:</DOCUMENT>

Cabana on Polaris

Following the Polaris upgrade to HPCM
1.10,
the module setup to use the prebuilt Kokkos changed.

Built against the prebuilt Kokkos on
polaris, the prebuilt Cabana
includes 3 backends: Serial and OpenMP for CPU execution and CUDA for GPU
execution. To use it, run

module load craype-x86-milan
module load craype-accel-nvidia80
module swap PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-gnu
module use /soft/modulefiles
module load cuda-PrgEnv-nvidia/12.2.91
module load kokkos cabana

<DOCUMENT>Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) mode

MIG mode can be enabled and configured on Polaris by passing a valid configuration file to qsub:

qsub ... -l mig_config=/home/ME/path/to/mig_config.json ...

You can find a concise explanation of MIG concepts and terms at https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/tesla/mig-user-guide/index.html#concepts

Configuration

Please study the following example of a valid configuration file:

shell
{
  ""group1"": {
    ""gpus"": [0,1],
    ""mig_enabled"": true,
    ""instances"": {""7g.40gb"": [""4c.7g.40gb"", ""3c.7g.40gb""] }
  },
  ""group2"": {
    ""gpus"": [2,3],
    ""mig_enabled"": true,
    ""instances"": {""3g.20gb"": [""2c.3g.20gb"", ""1c.3g.20gb""], ""2g.10gb"": [""2g.10gb""], ""1g.5gb"": [""1g.5gb""], ""1g.5gb"": [""1g.5gb""]}
  }
}

Notes

Group names are arbitrary, but must be unique

""gpus"" must be an array of integers.  if only one physical gpu is being configured in a group, it must still be contained within an array(ex. ""gpus"": [0],)

Only groups with mig_enabled set to true will be configured

instances denote the MIG gpu instances and the nested compute instances you wish to be configured

syntax is {""gpu instance 1"": [""cpu instance 1"", ""cpu instance 2""], ...}

valid gpu instances are 1g.5gb, 1g.10gb, 2g.10gb, 3g.20gb, 4g.20gb, and 7g.40gb.  the first number denotes the number of slots used out of 7 total, and the second number denotes memory in GB

the default cpu instance for any gpu instance has the same identifier as the gpu instance(in which case it will be the only one configurable)

other cpu instances can be configured with the identifier syntax Xc.Y, where X is the number of slots available in that gpu instance, and Y is the gpu instance identifier string

some gpu instances cannot be configured adjacently, despite there being sufficient slots/memory remaining(ex. 3g.20gb and 4g.20gb). Please see NVIDIA MIG documentation for further details</DOCUMENT>

<DOCUMENT>TensorFlow on Polaris

TensorFlow is a popular, open-source deep learning framework developed and released by Google.  The TensorFlow home page has more information about TensorFlow, which you can refer to.  For trouble shooting on Polaris, please contact support@alcf.anl.gov.

Installation on Polaris

TensorFlow is already pre-installed on Polaris, available in the conda module.  To use it from a compute node, please do:

bash
module load conda
conda activate

Then, you can load TensorFlow in python as usual (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):

```python

import tensorflow as tf
tf.version
'2.9.1'

```

This installation of TensorFlow was built from source and the CUDA libraries it uses are found via the CUDA_HOME environment variable (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):

bash
$ echo $CUDA_HOME
/soft/datascience/cuda/cuda_11.5.2_495.29.05_linux

If you need to build applications that use this version of TensorFlow and CUDA, we recommend using these cuda libraries to ensure compatibility.  We periodically update the TensorFlow release, though updates will come in the form of new versions of the conda module.

TensorFlow is also available through NVIDIA containers that have been translated to Singularity containers.  For more information about containers, please see the Containers documentation page.

TensorFlow Best Practices on Polaris

Single Node Performance

When running TensorFlow applications, we have found the following practices to be generally, if not universally, useful and encourage you to try some of these techniques to boost performance of your own applications.

Use Reduced Precision. Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with TensorFlow operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the tf.keras.mixed_precision Policy, as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  If you use a custom training loop (and not keras.Model.fit), you will also need to apply loss scaling.</DOCUMENT>

<DOCUMENT>Building on Polaris

The following table shows what compiler and flags to use with which PrgEnv:

module compiler flags PrgEnv-nvhpc cc/CC/ftn (nvc/nvc++/nvfortran) -mp=gpu -gpu=cc80 llvm mpicc/mpicxx (clang/clang++) -fopenmp -fopenmp-targets=nvptx64-nvidia-cuda PrgEnv-gnu cc/CC/ftn (gcc/g++/gfortran) -fopenmp PrgEnv-cray cc/CC/ftn -fopenmp

For example to compile a simple code hello.cpp:

For PrgEnv-nvhpc, after loading the modules as discussed above we would use:

CC -mp=gpu -gpu=cc80 hello.cpp
ftn -mp=gpu -gpu=cc80 hello.F90

For LLVM, after loading the modules as discussed above:

mpicxx -fopenmp -fopenmp-targets=nvptx64-nvidia-cuda hello.cpp

For PrgEnv-gnu, after loading the modules as discussed above we would use:

CC -fopenmp hello.cpp
ftn -fopenmp hello.F90

For PrgEnv-cray, after loading the modules as discussed above we would use:

CC -fopenmp hello.cpp
ftn -fopenmp hello.F90

Running on Polaris

To run, you can run the produced executable or with mpiexec in a job script, and then submit the script to the Polaris queue, like:

```
$ cat submit.sh

!/bin/sh

PBS -l select=1:system=polaris

PBS -l walltime=0:30:00

PBS -q debug

PBS -A Catalyst

PBS -l filesystems=home:eagle

cd ${PBS_O_WORKDIR}
 mpiexec -n 1 ./executable
$ # submit to the queue:
$ qsub -l select=1:system=polaris -l walltime=0:30:00 -l filesystems=home:eagle -q debug -A Catalyst ./submit.sh
```

In the above, having the PBS options in the script and on the command line is redundant, but we put it there to show both ways of launching. This submits the script to one node in the debug queue on Polaris, requesting 30 min and the eagle and home filesystems. It will charge project Catalyst for the time.

More details for setting up the job script are in Job Scheduling and Execution section.

```
$ cat hello.cpp

include

int main( int argv, char** argc ) {

printf( ""Number of devices: %d\n"", omp_get_num_devices() );</DOCUMENT>

Temporary workaround

Verify that JULIA_DEPOT_PATH is set to the correct path and JULIA_PATH
points to the Julia executable. When using juliaup, the Julia executable is
located in the juliaup folder of your JULIA_DEPOT_PATH.

Large-scale parallelism

CUDA.jl uses the nvcc compiler to compile GPU kernels. This will create object files in the TEMP filesystem. The default TMPDIR in a job on Polaris is set to a temp directory that only exists on the head node of a job. We recommend setting TEMPDIR to a local directory on each compute node.
bash
export TMPDIR=/local/scratch

A simple example to test gpu-aware MPI on multiple nodes is available here.</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) mode

MIG mode can be enabled and configured on Polaris by passing a valid configuration file to qsub:

qsub ... -l mig_config=/home/ME/path/to/mig_config.json ...

You can find a concise explanation of MIG concepts and terms at https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/tesla/mig-user-guide/index.html#concepts

Configuration

Please study the following example of a valid configuration file:

shell
{
  ""group1"": {
    ""gpus"": [0,1],
    ""mig_enabled"": true,
    ""instances"": {""7g.40gb"": [""4c.7g.40gb"", ""3c.7g.40gb""] }
  },
  ""group2"": {
    ""gpus"": [2,3],
    ""mig_enabled"": true,
    ""instances"": {""3g.20gb"": [""2c.3g.20gb"", ""1c.3g.20gb""], ""2g.10gb"": [""2g.10gb""], ""1g.5gb"": [""1g.5gb""], ""1g.5gb"": [""1g.5gb""]}
  }
}

Notes

Group names are arbitrary, but must be unique

""gpus"" must be an array of integers.  if only one physical gpu is being configured in a group, it must still be contained within an array(ex. ""gpus"": [0],)

Only groups with mig_enabled set to true will be configured

instances denote the MIG gpu instances and the nested compute instances you wish to be configured

syntax is {""gpu instance 1"": [""cpu instance 1"", ""cpu instance 2""], ...}

valid gpu instances are 1g.5gb, 1g.10gb, 2g.10gb, 3g.20gb, 4g.20gb, and 7g.40gb.  the first number denotes the number of slots used out of 7 total, and the second number denotes memory in GB

the default cpu instance for any gpu instance has the same identifier as the gpu instance(in which case it will be the only one configurable)

other cpu instances can be configured with the identifier syntax Xc.Y, where X is the number of slots available in that gpu instance, and Y is the gpu instance identifier string

some gpu instances cannot be configured adjacently, despite there being sufficient slots/memory remaining(ex. 3g.20gb and 4g.20gb). Please see NVIDIA MIG documentation for further details</DOCUMENT>

User: Are there any restrictions on which MIG gpu instances can be configured together?
Assistant: There are restrictions on which MIG GPU instances can be configured together, specifically some GPU instances cannot be configured adjacently, although the exact combinations of restricted instances are not explicitly listed.

Context: <DOCUMENT>Running Jobs on Polaris

Queues

There are five production queues you can target in your qsub (-q <queue name>):

Queue Name Node Min Node Max Time Min Time Max Notes debug 1 2 5 min 1 hr max 24 nodes in use by this queue ay any given time; Only 8 nodes are exclusive (see Note below) debug-scaling 1 10 5 min 1 hr max 1 job running/accruing/queued per-user prod 10 496 5 min 24 hrs Routing queue; See below preemptable 1 10 5 min 72 hrs Please be aware that jobs in the preemptable queue can be killed at any time if jobs are submitted to the demand queue. Max 20 jobs running/accruing/queued per-project ; see Note below demand 1 56 5 min 1 hr By request only ; max 100 jobs running/accruing/queued per-project

Note: Please be aware that jobs in the preemptable queue can be killed at any time if jobs are submitted to the demand queue.
Jobs in the demand queue take priority over jobs in the preemptable queue.
This means jobs in the preemptable queue may be preempted (killed without any warning) if there are jobs in the demand queue.
Unfortunately, there's always an inherent risk of jobs being killed when using the preemptable queue. 
Please use the following command to view details of a queue: qstat -Qf <queuename>

To make your job re-runable add the following PBS directive: #PBS -r y This will ensure your job will restart once the demand job is complete.

Note: The debug queue has 8 exclusively dedicated nodes.
If there are free nodes in production, then debug jobs can take another 16 nodes for a total of 24.

prod is routing queue and routes your job to one of the following six execution queues:

Queue Name Node Min Node Max Time Min Time Max Notes small 10 24 5 min 3 hrs medium 25 99 5 min 6 hrs large 100 496 5 min 24 hrs backfill-small 10 24 5 min 3 hrs low priority, negative project balance backfill-medium 25 99 5 min 6 hrs low priority, negative project balance backfill-large 100 496 5 min 24 hrs low priority, negative project balance</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Currently, MIG configuration is only available in the debug, debug-scaling, and preemptable queues.  submissions to other queues will result in any MIG config files passed being silently ignored

Files which do not match the above syntax will be silently rejected, and any invalid configurations in properly formatted files will be silently ignored. Please test any changes to your configuration in an interactive job session before use

A basic validator script is available at /soft/pbs/mig_conf_validate.sh. It will check for simple errors in your config, and print the expected configuration. For example:

```shell
ascovel@polaris-login-02:~> /soft/pbs/mig_conf_validate.sh -h
usage: mig_conf_validate.sh -c CONFIG_FILE

<DOCUMENT>Balsam

Balsam is a Python-based workflow manager that helps users execute large numbers of jobs, potentially with interjob dependencies, track job outcomes, and manage postprocessing analysis. A Balsam Site runs on a node with access to the job scheduler, where it can submit and monitor jobs. Overall job state is aggregated on the Balsam Server, making job data from all Sites accessible from any individual site (or the user's laptop), via the command-line interface or the Python API. To get information on how to use the command line tool, you can type balsam --help in your shell.

Full documentation for Balsam is available online.

Balsam requires Python 3.7+. To install Balsam on Polaris, first set up a virtual Python environment:

shell
module load conda
conda activate base
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --pre balsam

To use Balsam, users need an account on the Balsam server.  Users can get an account by contacting the ALCF Help Desk.  Once a user has an account, they can login and make a new site.  A Balsam site is a project space for your workflow. You will be prompted to select what machine (Polaris) you are working on when creating a new site:

shell
balsam login
balsam site init -n new-site new-site
cd new-site
balsam site start

See the Balsam documentation for full details.</DOCUMENT>

<DOCUMENT>and launch the ParaView server with

srizzi@x3005c0s7b0n0:~> mpirun -n 8 pvserver --server-port=8000
Waiting for client...
Connection URL: cs://x3005c0s7b0n0:8000
Accepting connection(s): x3005c0s7b0n0:8000

In this case pvserver will be listening on TCP port 8000 of your head node. You can change this port if you want.

Creating a tunnel over ssh

We need to establish an ssh tunnel to connect client to server. On your local machine open a new terminal and type:

ssh -v -N -L 8000:x3005c0s7b0n0:8000 polaris.alcf.anl.gov

where 8000 is a TCP port and x3005c0s7b0n0 the name of your head node. Adjust these values accordingly.

Among multiple lines with debug information,  you should see something like:

debug1: Local connections to LOCALHOST:8000 forwarded to remote address x3005c0s7b0n0:8000

Keep this terminal open for the duration of your session to keep the ssh tunnel active.

Now you are ready to launch your ParaView client locally. Keep in mind that client and servers versions must match. The ParaView version currently deployed on Polaris is 5.12.0

Connecting to ParaView server

Connect your ParaView client to the server configuration you created above. You can select Connect, either from the File menu, or the icon circled in the figure:

and selecting the configuration you created in a previous step.

The connection should point to:

localhost:8000

In the terminal where you launched the server you will see now that the connection is established. Note that ParaView may take a few seconds to connect. This is normal behavior.

username@x3005c0s7b0n0:~> mpirun -n 8 pvserver --server-port=8000

Connection URL: cs://x3005c0s7b0n0:8000

<DOCUMENT>QMCPACK on Polaris

QMCPACK, is a modern high-performance open-source Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation code. Its main applications are electronic structure calculations of molecular, quasi-2D and solid-state systems. Variational Monte Carlo (VMC), diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) and a number of other advanced QMC algorithms are implemented. Orbital space auxiliary field QMC (AFQMC) has recently been added. By directly solving the Schrodinger equation, QMC methods offer greater accuracy than methods such as density functional theory, but at a trade-off of much greater computational expense.

Prebuilt executables are provided at /soft/applications/qmcpack.
The directory of each installation also includes a job submission script example qmcpack-polaris.job.
Update build recipe is provided on GitHub.</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Currently, MIG configuration is only available in the debug, debug-scaling, and preemptable queues.  submissions to other queues will result in any MIG config files passed being silently ignored

Files which do not match the above syntax will be silently rejected, and any invalid configurations in properly formatted files will be silently ignored. Please test any changes to your configuration in an interactive job session before use

A basic validator script is available at /soft/pbs/mig_conf_validate.sh. It will check for simple errors in your config, and print the expected configuration. For example:

```shell
ascovel@polaris-login-02:~> /soft/pbs/mig_conf_validate.sh -h
usage: mig_conf_validate.sh -c CONFIG_FILE
ascovel@polaris-login-02:~> /soft/pbs/mig_conf_validate.sh -c ./polaris-mig/mig_config.json

Context: <DOCUMENT>LAMMPS

Overview

LAMMPS is a general-purpose molecular dynamics software package for massively parallel computers. It is written in an exceptionally clean style that makes it one of the more popular codes for users to extend and it currently has dozens of user-developed extensions.

For details about the code and its usage, see the LAMMPS home page. This page provides information specific to running on Polaris at the ALCF.

Using LAMMPS at ALCF

ALCF provides assistance with build instructions, compiling executables, submitting jobs, and providing prebuilt binaries (upon request). A collection of Makefiles and submission scripts are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo here. For questions, contact us at support@alcf.anl.gov.

How to Obtain the Code

LAMMPS is an open-source code, which can be downloaded from the LAMMPS website.

Building on Polaris

After LAMMPS has been downloaded and unpacked on an ALCF filesystem, users should see a directory whose name is of the form lammps-<version>. One should then see the Makefile lammps-<version>/src/MAKE/MACHINES/Makefile.polaris in recent versions that can be used as a starting point for compilation on Polaris. Copies of Makefiles for building with the GPU/KOKKOS package using CUDA for GPU support with the GNU/NVHPC compiler are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo here. For older versions of LAMMPS, you may need to take an existing Makefile (e.g. Makefile.mpi) for your specific version of LAMMPS and edit the top portion appropratiately to create a new Makefile.polaris.

KOKKOS package and GNU compilers

The following modules are useful for this particular build. Note, the cmake module is not required if using the GNU Makefile procedure to build LAMMPS. The initial module restore is just setting the default environment as the starting point. Users may find it useful to copy these module commands into a small helper script to assist with compiling and running LAMMPS (e.g. setup_lammps_gnu.sh).</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>[""ParaView and Visit\n\nParaView module has been updated. For more information, see https://docs.alcf.anl.gov/polaris/visualization/paraview/ and https://docs.alcf.anl.gov/polaris/visualization/paraview-manual-launch/\n\nVisit module is in the process of being updated.\n\nChanges to Memory Limits on Login Nodes\n\nMemory limits were lowered on the logins due to resource contention to 8GB of memory, and 8 cores per user. \nThis might result in error messages indicating abnormal process termination for user processes run on logins.\n\nExamples of the error messages people might see are:\n\nnvcc error   : 'cudafe++' died due to signal 9 (Kill signal)\n\ng++-12: fatal error: Killed signal terminated program cc1plus\n\nThese errors are likely due to exhausting the per-user resources on a login node as each user is allocated 8 cores and 8GB memory.\nTo avoid this you can either:\n\nReduce the parallelism of your compile, such as using -j or -j4 flags\n\nRequest a debug node and run your compile there where you will have the full resources of the node at your disposal"", 'data/md/polaris/system-updates.md']</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Spack PE

Spack is an HPC-oriented package manager which ALCF uses to install software for
the user environment.

ALCF's Spack PE is a Spack-managed software stack which provides various build
tools, utilities, and libraries. It consists of a base stack (spack-pe-base)
and PrgEnv-dependent stacks (currently spack-pe-gnu).

spack-pe-base contains commonplace software compiled for CPU with the system
GCC compilers. Accordingly, the software in spack-pe-base can be used
regardless of programming environment.

spack-pe-gnu is based on the E4S Project and
provides performant HPC libraries built with PrgEnv-gnu and the nvcc CUDA
compiler driver for GPU code. spack-pe-gnu is dependent on both
spack-pe-base and PrgEnv-gnu.

Using software from the Spack PE

The base suite of software tools and libraries can be accessed by loading the
spack-pe-base module. This adds a path to $MODULEPATH which contains
numerous modules.

For example, to load cmake starting from the default environment, a user
should run the following commands:
module use /soft/modulefiles
module load spack-pe-base
module load cmake

The spack-pe-base module adds paths to the user's MODULEPATH; individual packages are subsequently loaded through the newly available modules. The full list of available packages can be viewed by running module avail or module --show-hidden avail for a complete listing. Packages are loaded in the same way from spack-pe-gnu.

Inspecting packages

When a module in the Spack PE is loaded, several environment variables are
updated to integrate the package into the user's environment. Additionally, the
PACKAGE_ROOT variable is set to the path to the installation prefix of the
package. For example, after loading cmake as above:

$ echo $CMAKE_ROOT
/soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/install/linux-sles15-x86_64/gcc-12.3.0/cmake-3.27.7-a435jtzvweeos2es6enirbxdjdqhqgdp/
$ ls -a $CMAKE_ROOT
.  ..  bin  doc  share  .spack</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Gromacs on Polaris

What is Gromacs?

GROMACS is a versatile package to perform molecular dynamics, i.e. simulate the Newtonian equations of motion for systems with hundreds to millions of particles. It is primarily designed for biochemical molecules like proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids that have a lot of complicated bonded interactions, but since GROMACS is extremely fast at calculating the nonbonded interactions (that usually dominate simulations) many groups are also using it for research on non-biological systems, e.g. polymers.

Using GROMACS at ALCF

ALCF offers assistance with building binaries and compiling instructions for GROMACS. For questions, contact us at support@alcf.anl.gov.

The default Resolution is set to 100. This will make things a bit cluttered, especially when we start adding in the other data, so let's reduce this to 25

Click the Apply button

6. Streamlines as Tubes

The streamlines are just that, lines. We can use the Tubes filter to represent them as 3D objects, rather than just lines.
- With StreamTracer1selected in the Pipeline Browser, from the main menu select: Filters->Alphabetical->Tube
- In the Object Inspector make sure the Properties tab is selected
- The default value for the Radius is a bit too large for this data, let's set that value to 0
- Click the Apply button
- Notice that the StreamLine1 object has automatically been hidden
- There are many different ways to color these tubes
- With Tubes1 selected, switch to the Display tab in the Object Inspector
- The Color bydropdown lets you choose from a handful of different variables

7. Cutting Planes (Slices)

Now let's add some cutting plans, or slices, to see what the cross-section of the continuum data looks like.
- Again, be sure that the continuum.000*data is selected in the Pipeline Browser
- Filters->Alphabetical->Slice or Click on the Slice icon from the menu bar
- In the Object Inspector make sure the Propertiestab is selected
- At the bottom on the Object Inspector is a section titled Slice Offset Values. Here we can generate values for multiple slices to be made
- First click the Delete All button to remove initial values
- Next, click the New Range button. This will bring up an Add Range dialog box.
- Set the number of Steps to 7. Click OK
- Click the Apply button
- With Slice1 selected in the Object Inspector, switch to the Display tab
- Set Color by value to Velocity

Xterm executable: the path of a terminal on your system. The figure shows the case of a Mac with XQuartz. You may need to change these values for Windows or Linux.

SSH executable: the name of your ssh command. It may be different on Windows depending on the ssh client installed (i.e putty)

Remote machine: leave this value at polaris.alcf.anl.gov

Username: your ALCF user name

ParaView version: the version of Paraview that you want to use. Verify first that this version is installed on the system (as described at the top of this document). You will also need to add a -EGL suffix.

Example:
5.12.0-EGL

Client port: it is safe to use the default value

Server port: is is safe to use the default value

Number of nodes to reserve: enter the number of Polaris compute nodes you want to use for your job

Number of ranks per node: enter the number of ranks per node

Number of minutes to reserve: the duration of your job in minutes

Account: enter here the name of your ALCF allocation

Queue: the name of the Polaris queue you would like to use (i.e: debug for small, quick jobs, prod, preemptable)

File Systems: enter here the file systems you need for your job, separated with colons, no spaces. Keep in mind that your job may not run if one of these file systems is not available at that time, so enter these values carefully

Job name: safe to use default value. The PBS scheduler will assign this name to your job

Now you can press OK to establish the connection with a ParaView server on Polaris.

An ssh connection will be established with a Polaris login node and a password will be requested in a terminal, similar to the process you normally use to connect and work on the system.</DOCUMENT>

Building a Kokkos Application Using make

Here's an example Makefile:

```

KOKKOS_HOME set via:

module load kokkos

You can look at the first lines of $KOKKOS_HOME/KokkosConfigCommon.cmake to

see the flags used in cmake configuration of the kokkos library build. The

default Kokkos module on Polaris was built with PrgEnv-nvhpc and includes

Serial, OpenMP (threads) and CUDA backends. So you should have that

environment module loaded and include compiler flags for cuda and openmp:

Cray MPI wrapper for C++ and C compilers:

CXX=CC
CC=cc

CPPFLAGS=-cuda -fopenmp

Configuring Your Own Kokkos Build on Polaris

Here are recommended environment settings and configuration to build your own
kokkos libraries on Polaris:

Environment

To match what was done in the centrally-built kokkos associated with the
modules discussed above, use the programming environment
PrgEnv-gnu, and use the Cray wrapper CC as the C++ compiler. You'll also
need to explicitly load the Cuda toolkit version 12.2.91 as shown:</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>$ nsys profile -o {output_filename} --stats=true ./{your_application}

Run your application on multiple nodes (e.g., 2 nodes) with Nsight Systems as follows:
$ mpirun -n 8 --ppn 4 --env TMPDIR=/home/{user ID}/ nsys profile -o {output_filename}_%q{PMI_RANK} --stats=true ./{your_application}

Nsight Compute

Run your application with Nsight Compute.

$ ncu --set detailed -k {kernel_name} -o {output_filename} ./{your_application}

Remark: Without -o option, Nsight Compute provides performance data as a standard output

Post-processing the profiled data

Post-processing via CLI

$ nsys stats {output_filename}.qdrep
$ ncu -i {output_filename}.ncu-rep

Post-processing on your local system via GUI

Install NVIDIA Nsight Systems and NVIDIA Nsight Compute after downloading both of them from the  NVIDIA Developer Zone. 
Remark: Local client version should be the same as or newer than NVIDIA Nsight tools on Polaris.

Download nsys output files (i.e., ending with .qdrep and . sqlite) to your local system, and then open them with NVIDIA Nsight Systems on your local system.

Download ncu output files (i.e., ending with .ncu-rep) to your local system, and then open them with NVIDIA Nsight Compute on your local system.

<DOCUMENT>Julia

Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for
technical computing. It has a syntax familiar to users of many other
technical computing environments. Designed at MIT to tackle large-scale
partial-differential equation simulation and distributed linear algebra, Julia
features a robust ecosystem of tools for
optimization,
statistics, parallel programming, and data
visualization. Julia is actively developed by the Julia
Labs team at MIT and in
industry, along with hundreds of domain-expert
scientists and programmers worldwide.

Contributing

This guide is a first draft of the Julia documentation for Polaris. If you have any
suggestions or contributions, please open a pull request or contact us by
opening a ticket at the ALCF Helpdesk.

Julia Installation

We encourage users interested in using Julia on Polaris to install in their home or project directories at this time. Using the official Julia 1.9 binaries from the Julia
webpage is recommended.
Juliaup provides a convenient way to
install Julia and manage the various Julia versions. The default installation will install julia, juliaup, and other commands in a ${HOME}/.julia directory and update profile files like .bashrc to update PATH to include that directory. One can customize the installation to change these defaults.

bash
module load craype-accel-nvidia80
curl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh

If you chose a custom installation, then be sure to update the PATH environment variable appropriately.

export PATH=${HOME}/.juliaup/bin:${PATH}

You may then list the available Julia versions with juliaup list and install a
specific version with juliaup install <version>. You can then activate a
specific version with juliaup use <version> and set the default version with
juliaup default <version>. juliaup update will update the installed Julia
versions. In general, the latest stable release of Julia should be used.

bash
juliaup add release

Julia Project Environment</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Mixed C/C++ & Fortran Applications

For applications consisting of a mix of C/C++ and Fortran that also uses MPI, it is suggested that the programming environment chosen for Fortran be used to build the full application because of mpi.mod (and similar) incompatibilities.

Compiling for GPUs

It is assumed the majority of applications to be built on Polaris will make use of the GPUs. As such, the craype-accel-nvidia80 module is in the default environment. This has the effect of the Cray compiler wrappers adding -gpu to the compiler invocation along with additional include paths and libraries. Additional compilers flags may be needed depending on the compiler and GPU programming model used (e.g. -cuda, -acc, or -mp=gpu).

This module also adds GPU Transport Layer (GTL) libraries to the link-line to support GPU-aware MPI applications.

Context: <DOCUMENT>Running Jobs on Polaris

Queues

There are five production queues you can target in your qsub (-q <queue name>):

Queue Name Node Min Node Max Time Min Time Max Notes debug 1 2 5 min 1 hr max 24 nodes in use by this queue ay any given time; Only 8 nodes are exclusive (see Note below) debug-scaling 1 10 5 min 1 hr max 1 job running/accruing/queued per-user prod 10 496 5 min 24 hrs Routing queue; See below preemptable 1 10 5 min 72 hrs Please be aware that jobs in the preemptable queue can be killed at any time if jobs are submitted to the demand queue. Max 20 jobs running/accruing/queued per-project ; see Note below demand 1 56 5 min 1 hr By request only ; max 100 jobs running/accruing/queued per-project

Note: Please be aware that jobs in the preemptable queue can be killed at any time if jobs are submitted to the demand queue.
Jobs in the demand queue take priority over jobs in the preemptable queue.
This means jobs in the preemptable queue may be preempted (killed without any warning) if there are jobs in the demand queue.
Unfortunately, there's always an inherent risk of jobs being killed when using the preemptable queue. 
Please use the following command to view details of a queue: qstat -Qf <queuename>

To make your job re-runable add the following PBS directive: #PBS -r y This will ensure your job will restart once the demand job is complete.

Note: The debug queue has 8 exclusively dedicated nodes.
If there are free nodes in production, then debug jobs can take another 16 nodes for a total of 24.

prod is routing queue and routes your job to one of the following six execution queues:

Queue Name Node Min Node Max Time Min Time Max Notes small 10 24 5 min 3 hrs medium 25 99 5 min 6 hrs large 100 496 5 min 24 hrs backfill-small 10 24 5 min 3 hrs low priority, negative project balance backfill-medium 25 99 5 min 6 hrs low priority, negative project balance backfill-large 100 496 5 min 24 hrs low priority, negative project balance</DOCUMENT>

<DOCUMENT>GNU Compilers on Polaris

The GNU compilers are available on Polaris via the PrgEnv-gnu and gcc-mixed modules. The gcc-mixed module can be useful when, for example, the PrgEnv-nvhpc compilers are used to compile C/C++ MPI-enabled code and gfortran is needed.

The GNU compilers currently on Polaris do not support GPU code generation and thus can only be used for compiling CPU codes.

The nvhpc and llvm compilers can be used for compiling GPU-enabled applications.</DOCUMENT>

Differences between nvcc and nvc/nvc++

For users that want to continue using nvcc it is important to be mindful of differences with the newer nvc and nvc++ compilers. For example, the -cuda flag instructs nvcc to compile .cu input files to .cu.cpp.ii output files which are to be separately compiled, whereas the same -cuda flag instructs nvc, nvc++, and nvfortran to enable CUDA C/C++ or CUDA Fortran code generation. The resulting output file in each case is different (text vs. object) and one may see unrecognized format error when -cuda is incorrectly passed to nvcc.

Known Issues and Workarounds

If you are using nvcc to invoke nvc++ and compiling C++17 code, and are seeing the following warning and unable to compile C++17 constructs:

```
polaris-login-01(~)> nvcc --std=c++17 -ccbin nvc++ ~/smalltests/bool_constant.cpp
nvcc warning : The -std=c++17 flag is not supported with the configured host compiler. Flag will be ignored.

2 errors detected in the compilation of ""/home/zippy/smalltests/bool_constant.cpp"".

you will need to work around it by loading the latest cudatoolkit module atop PrgEnv-nvhpc:

Running GPU-enabled Applications

GPU-enabled applications will similarly run on the compute nodes using the above example script.
- The environment variable MPICH_GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED=1 needs to be set if your application requires MPI-GPU support whereby the MPI library sends and receives data directly from GPU buffers. In this case, it will be important to have the craype-accel-nvidia80 module loaded both when compiling your application and during runtime to correctly link against a GPU Transport Layer (GTL) MPI library. Otherwise, you'll likely see GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED is requested, but GTL library is not linked errors during runtime.
- If running on a specific GPU or subset of GPUs is desired, then the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable can be used. For example, if one only wanted an application to access the first two GPUs on a node, then setting CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 could be used.

Binding MPI ranks to GPUs

The Cray MPI on Polaris does not currently support binding MPI ranks to GPUs. For applications that need this support, this instead can be handled by use of a small helper script that will appropriately set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES for each MPI rank. One example is available here where each MPI rank is similarly bound to a single GPU with round-robin assignment.

A example set_affinity_gpu_polaris.sh script follows where GPUs are assigned round-robin to MPI ranks.

```bash

!/bin/bash -l

num_gpus=4

need to assign GPUs in reverse order due to topology

<DOCUMENT>TensorFlow on Polaris

TensorFlow is a popular, open-source deep learning framework developed and released by Google.  The TensorFlow home page has more information about TensorFlow, which you can refer to.  For trouble shooting on Polaris, please contact support@alcf.anl.gov.

Installation on Polaris

TensorFlow is already pre-installed on Polaris, available in the conda module.  To use it from a compute node, please do:

bash
module load conda
conda activate

Then, you can load TensorFlow in python as usual (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):

```python

import tensorflow as tf
tf.version
'2.9.1'

```

This installation of TensorFlow was built from source and the CUDA libraries it uses are found via the CUDA_HOME environment variable (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):

bash
$ echo $CUDA_HOME
/soft/datascience/cuda/cuda_11.5.2_495.29.05_linux

If you need to build applications that use this version of TensorFlow and CUDA, we recommend using these cuda libraries to ensure compatibility.  We periodically update the TensorFlow release, though updates will come in the form of new versions of the conda module.

TensorFlow is also available through NVIDIA containers that have been translated to Singularity containers.  For more information about containers, please see the Containers documentation page.

TensorFlow Best Practices on Polaris

Single Node Performance

When running TensorFlow applications, we have found the following practices to be generally, if not universally, useful and encourage you to try some of these techniques to boost performance of your own applications.

Use Reduced Precision. Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with TensorFlow operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the tf.keras.mixed_precision Policy, as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  If you use a custom training loop (and not keras.Model.fit), you will also need to apply loss scaling.</DOCUMENT>

Julia Installation

We encourage users interested in using Julia on Polaris to install in their home or project directories at this time. Using the official Julia 1.9 binaries from the Julia
webpage is recommended.
Juliaup provides a convenient way to
install Julia and manage the various Julia versions. The default installation will install julia, juliaup, and other commands in a ${HOME}/.julia directory and update profile files like .bashrc to update PATH to include that directory. One can customize the installation to change these defaults.

bash
module load craype-accel-nvidia80
curl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh

If you chose a custom installation, then be sure to update the PATH environment variable appropriately.

export PATH=${HOME}/.juliaup/bin:${PATH}

You may then list the available Julia versions with juliaup list and install a
specific version with juliaup install <version>. You can then activate a
specific version with juliaup use <version> and set the default version with
juliaup default <version>. juliaup update will update the installed Julia
versions. In general, the latest stable release of Julia should be used.

bash
juliaup add release

<DOCUMENT>Parsl on Polaris

Parsl is a flexible and scalable parallel programming library for Python.

-- Parsl Documentation

For many applications, managing an ensemble of jobs into a workflow is a critical step that can easily become a performance bottleneck.  Many tools exist to address this, of which parsl is just one.  On this page, we'll highlight some of the key pieces of information about parsl that are relevant to Polaris.  Parsl is also extensively documented, has a dedicated Slack Channel, and a large community of users and developers beyond ALCF.  We encourage you to engage with the parsl community for support with parsl specific questions, and for Polaris-specific questions or problems, please contact support@alcf.anl.gov.

Getting Parsl on Polaris

You can install parsl building off of the conda modules.  You have some flexibility in how you want to extend the conda module to include parsl, but here is an example way to do it:

```python

Load the Conda Module (needed everytime you use parsl)

module load conda
conda activate

Create a virtual env that uses the conda env as the system packages.

Only do the next line on initial set up:

python -m venv --system-site-packages /path/to/your/virtualenv

Load the virtual env (every time):

source /path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/activate

Install parsl (only once)

pip install parsl

```

Using Parsl on Polaris

Parsl has a variety of possible configuration settings.  As an example, we provide the configuration below that will run one task per GPU:

```python
from parsl.config import Config

PBSPro is the right provider for Polaris:

from parsl.providers import PBSProProvider

The high throughput executor is for scaling to HPC systems:

from parsl.executors import HighThroughputExecutor

You can use the MPI launcher, but may want the Gnu Parallel launcher, see below

from parsl.launchers import MpiExecLauncher, GnuParallelLauncher

address_by_interface is needed for the HighThroughputExecutor:</DOCUMENT>

User: How can I install Julia and manage different Julia versions using a convenient method called Juliaup?

<DOCUMENT>Mixed C/C++ & Fortran Applications

For applications consisting of a mix of C/C++ and Fortran that also uses MPI, it is suggested that the programming environment chosen for Fortran be used to build the full application because of mpi.mod (and similar) incompatibilities.

Compiling for GPUs

It is assumed the majority of applications to be built on Polaris will make use of the GPUs. As such, the craype-accel-nvidia80 module is in the default environment. This has the effect of the Cray compiler wrappers adding -gpu to the compiler invocation along with additional include paths and libraries. Additional compilers flags may be needed depending on the compiler and GPU programming model used (e.g. -cuda, -acc, or -mp=gpu).

This module also adds GPU Transport Layer (GTL) libraries to the link-line to support GPU-aware MPI applications.

For additional information on the Cray wrappers, please refer to the man pages.

KOKKOS package and NVHPC compilers

The following modules are useful for this particular build. Note, the cmake module is not required if using the GNU Makefile procedure to build LAMMPS. The initial module restore is just setting the default environment as the starting point. Users may find it useful to copy these module commands into a small helper script to assist with compiling and running LAMMPS (e.g. setup_lammps_nvhpc.sh).</DOCUMENT>

Julia Project Environment

The Julia built-in package manager allows you to create a project and enable
project-specific dependencies. Julia manages packages in the Julia depot located
by default in ~/.julia. However, that NFS filesystem is not meant for
high-speed access. Therefore, this Julia depot folder should be located on a
fast filesystem of your choice (grand, eagle). The Julia depot directory is
set via the environment variable JULIA_DEPOT_PATH. For example, you can set
the Julia depot to a directory on Polaris grand filesystem by adding the following line
to your ~/.bashrc file:

bash
export JULIA_DEPOT_PATH=/grand/$PROJECT/$USER/julia_depot

Programming Julia on Polaris

There are three key components to using Julia for large-scale computations:

MPI support through MPI.jl

GPU support through CUDA.jl

HDF5 support through HDF5.jl

In addition, we recommend VSCode with the Julia
extension for a modern IDE experience, together
with the ssh-remote extension for remote interactive development.

MPI Support

MPI support is provided through the MPI.jl.
bash
$ julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(""MPI"")'
This will install the MPI.jl package and default MPI prebuilt binaries provided by an artifact. For on-node debugging purposes the default artifact is sufficient. However, for large-scale computations, it is important to use the Cray MPICH installed on Polaris. As of MPI.jl v0.20 this is handled through MPIPrefences.jl.
$ julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(""MPIPreferences"")'
$ julia --project -e 'using MPIPreferences; MPIPreferences.use_system_binary(vendor=""cray"")'

The vendor=""cray"" option is important if you intend to use gpu-aware MPI in your applications.

Check that the correct MPI library is targeted with Julia.
```
julia --project -e 'using MPI; MPI.versioninfo()'

<DOCUMENT>LAMMPS

Overview

LAMMPS is a general-purpose molecular dynamics software package for massively parallel computers. It is written in an exceptionally clean style that makes it one of the more popular codes for users to extend and it currently has dozens of user-developed extensions.

For details about the code and its usage, see the LAMMPS home page. This page provides information specific to running on Polaris at the ALCF.

Using LAMMPS at ALCF

ALCF provides assistance with build instructions, compiling executables, submitting jobs, and providing prebuilt binaries (upon request). A collection of Makefiles and submission scripts are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo here. For questions, contact us at support@alcf.anl.gov.

How to Obtain the Code

LAMMPS is an open-source code, which can be downloaded from the LAMMPS website.

Building on Polaris

After LAMMPS has been downloaded and unpacked on an ALCF filesystem, users should see a directory whose name is of the form lammps-<version>. One should then see the Makefile lammps-<version>/src/MAKE/MACHINES/Makefile.polaris in recent versions that can be used as a starting point for compilation on Polaris. Copies of Makefiles for building with the GPU/KOKKOS package using CUDA for GPU support with the GNU/NVHPC compiler are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo here. For older versions of LAMMPS, you may need to take an existing Makefile (e.g. Makefile.mpi) for your specific version of LAMMPS and edit the top portion appropratiately to create a new Makefile.polaris.

KOKKOS package and GNU compilers

The following modules are useful for this particular build. Note, the cmake module is not required if using the GNU Makefile procedure to build LAMMPS. The initial module restore is just setting the default environment as the starting point. Users may find it useful to copy these module commands into a small helper script to assist with compiling and running LAMMPS (e.g. setup_lammps_gnu.sh).</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>FFmpeg on Polaris

NOTE: FFmpeg module is currently missing on Polaris after a recent upgrade. A spack build of ffmpeg will be available soon

To use FFmpeg on Polaris first load the corresponding module:

module load ffmpeg

This is a typical command line to create a movie from a series of snapshots in PNG format:

ffmpeg -r 15 -i frames.%03d.png -r 25 -pix_fmt yuv420p movie.mp4

where:

r 15 is the input frame rate. Experiment with values smaller than the output frame rate for longer movies.
-r 25 is the output frame rate (use this value for standard 25 frames per second)
-i frames.%03d.png reads the input frames in sequence
-pix_fmt yuv420p is needed for movies to play in browsers
movie.mp4 is the resulting movie</DOCUMENT>

juliaup add release

Julia Project Environment

The Julia built-in package manager allows you to create a project and enable
project-specific dependencies. Julia manages packages in the Julia depot located
by default in ~/.julia. However, that NFS filesystem is not meant for
high-speed access. Therefore, this Julia depot folder should be located on a
fast filesystem of your choice (grand, eagle). The Julia depot directory is
set via the environment variable JULIA_DEPOT_PATH. For example, you can set
the Julia depot to a directory on Polaris grand filesystem by adding the following line
to your ~/.bashrc file:

bash
export JULIA_DEPOT_PATH=/grand/$PROJECT/$USER/julia_depot

Programming Julia on Polaris

There are three key components to using Julia for large-scale computations:

MPI support through MPI.jl

GPU support through CUDA.jl

HDF5 support through HDF5.jl

In addition, we recommend VSCode with the Julia
extension for a modern IDE experience, together
with the ssh-remote extension for remote interactive development.

MPI Support

MPI support is provided through the MPI.jl.
bash
$ julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(""MPI"")'
This will install the MPI.jl package and default MPI prebuilt binaries provided by an artifact. For on-node debugging purposes the default artifact is sufficient. However, for large-scale computations, it is important to use the Cray MPICH installed on Polaris. As of MPI.jl v0.20 this is handled through MPIPrefences.jl.
$ julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(""MPIPreferences"")'
$ julia --project -e 'using MPIPreferences; MPIPreferences.use_system_binary(vendor=""cray"")'

The vendor=""cray"" option is important if you intend to use gpu-aware MPI in your applications.

Check that the correct MPI library is targeted with Julia.
```
julia --project -e 'using MPI; MPI.versioninfo()'
MPIPreferences:
  binary:  system
  abi:     MPICH
  libmpi:  libmpi_nvidia.so
  mpiexec: mpiexec</DOCUMENT>

``
When running on the login node, switch back to the default provided MPI binaries inMPI_jll.jl

by removing theLocalPreferences.toml` file.

GPU Support

NVIDIA GPU support is provided through the CUDA.jl package. The default in Julia is to download artifacts (e.g. CUDA toolkit) based on the runtime detected. While that should generally work, it is recommended to use the local CUDA installation provided on Polaris especially if using gpu-aware MPI in your workloads (important to use supported versions of CUDA with Cray MPICH provided).

To use the local CUDA installation provided by the modules on Polaris, the LocalPreferences.toml file can be modified as follows.

$ head $JULIA_DEPOT_PATH/environments/v1.10/LocalPreferences.toml
[CUDA_Runtime_jll]
local = true

If using the default PrgEnv-nvhpc module on Polaris, then it will be necessary to correct a path to the CUPTI library to successfully install CUDA.jl.

$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$CRAY_NVIDIA_PREFIX/cuda/12.2/extras/CUPTI/lib64/
$ julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(""CUDA"")'

The GPUs are not currently usable on the Polaris login nodes, so one can confirm the version of CUDA being used by testing in a batch or interactive job on a compute node.

```

Special notes for Polaris

On Polaris, there is a known bug where python applications launched with mpi and that use fork to spawn processes can sometimes have unexplaned hangs.  For this reason, it is recommended to use start_method=""spawn"" on Polaris when using the MpiExecLauncher as is shown in the example config above.  Alternatively, another solution is to use the GNUParallelLauncher which uses GNU Parallel to spawn processes.  GNU Parallel can be loaded in your environment with the command module load gnu-parallel.  Both of these approaches will circumvent the hang issue from using fork.

Updates

For parsl versions after July 2023, the address passed in the HighThroughputExecutor needs to be set to address = address_by_interface(""bond0"").  With parsl versions prior to July 2023, it was recommended to use address = address_by_hostname() on Polaris, but with later versions this will not work on Polaris (or any other machine).</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Gromacs on Polaris

What is Gromacs?

GROMACS is a versatile package to perform molecular dynamics, i.e. simulate the Newtonian equations of motion for systems with hundreds to millions of particles. It is primarily designed for biochemical molecules like proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids that have a lot of complicated bonded interactions, but since GROMACS is extremely fast at calculating the nonbonded interactions (that usually dominate simulations) many groups are also using it for research on non-biological systems, e.g. polymers.

Using GROMACS at ALCF

ALCF offers assistance with building binaries and compiling instructions for GROMACS. For questions, contact us at support@alcf.anl.gov.

Running Gromacs on Polaris

Prebuilt Gromacs binaries can be found in the directory /soft/applications/Gromacs/gromacs-2022.1.

A sample pbs script follows that will run GROMACS on two nodes, using 4 MPI ranks per node, and each rank with four OpenMP threads. The PME kernel owns one MPI rank and one GPU per node, while the nonbonded kernel uses 3 MPI ranks and 3 GPUs per node.

For performance, it will likely be necessary to ensure that each application runs on a distinct set of CPU resources and/or targets specific GPUs. One can provide a list of CPUs using the --cpu-bind option, which when combined with CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES provides a user with specifying exactly which CPU and GPU resources to run each application on. In the example below, four instances of the application are simultaneously running on a single node. In the first instance, the application is spawning MPI ranks 0-7 on CPUs 24-31 and using GPU 0.

Notes</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>LLVM Compilers on Polaris

This page is not about LLVM-based Cray Compiling Environment (CCE) compilers from PrgEnv-cray but about open source LLVM compilers.

If LLVM compilers are needed without MPI support, simply load the llvm module.

Cray Programming Environment does not offer LLVM compiler support.
Thus cc/CC/ftn compiler wrappers using LLVM compilers currently are not available.
To use Clang with MPI, one can load the mpiwrappers/cray-mpich-llvm module which loads the following modules.

llvm, upstream llvm compilers

cray-mpich, MPI compiler wrappers mpicc/mpicxx/mpif90. mpif90 uses gfortran because flang is not ready for production use.

cray-pals, MPI launchers mpiexec/aprun/mpirun

Limitation There is no GPU-aware MPI library linking support by default. If needed, users should manually add the GTL (GPU Transport Layer) library to the application link line.

OpenMP offload

When targeting the OpenMP or CUDA programming models for GPUs, the cudatoolkit-standalone module should also be loaded.</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>3. Use ParaView

After the previous step, you can now select POLARIS@ANL in the File->Connect menu and press Connect

At this point a new window will pop up

There are a number of parameters that you must enter manually here:

Xterm executable: the path of a terminal on your system. The figure shows the case of a Mac with XQuartz. You may need to change these values for Windows or Linux.

SSH executable: the name of your ssh command. It may be different on Windows depending on the ssh client installed (i.e putty)

Remote machine: leave this value at polaris.alcf.anl.gov

Username: your ALCF user name

ParaView version: the version of Paraview that you want to use. Verify first that this version is installed on the system (as described at the top of this document). You will also need to add a -EGL suffix.

Example:
5.12.0-EGL

Client port: it is safe to use the default value

Server port: is is safe to use the default value

Number of nodes to reserve: enter the number of Polaris compute nodes you want to use for your job

Number of ranks per node: enter the number of ranks per node

Number of minutes to reserve: the duration of your job in minutes

Account: enter here the name of your ALCF allocation

Queue: the name of the Polaris queue you would like to use (i.e: debug for small, quick jobs, prod, preemptable)

File Systems: enter here the file systems you need for your job, separated with colons, no spaces. Keep in mind that your job may not run if one of these file systems is not available at that time, so enter these values carefully

Job name: safe to use default value. The PBS scheduler will assign this name to your job

Now you can press OK to establish the connection with a ParaView server on Polaris.

An ssh connection will be established with a Polaris login node and a password will be requested in a terminal, similar to the process you normally use to connect and work on the system.</DOCUMENT>

GPU Support

NVIDIA GPU support is provided through the CUDA.jl package. The default in Julia is to download artifacts (e.g. CUDA toolkit) based on the runtime detected. While that should generally work, it is recommended to use the local CUDA installation provided on Polaris especially if using gpu-aware MPI in your workloads (important to use supported versions of CUDA with Cray MPICH provided).

To use the local CUDA installation provided by the modules on Polaris, the LocalPreferences.toml file can be modified as follows.

$ head $JULIA_DEPOT_PATH/environments/v1.10/LocalPreferences.toml
[CUDA_Runtime_jll]
local = true

If using the default PrgEnv-nvhpc module on Polaris, then it will be necessary to correct a path to the CUPTI library to successfully install CUDA.jl.

$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$CRAY_NVIDIA_PREFIX/cuda/12.2/extras/CUPTI/lib64/
$ julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(""CUDA"")'

The GPUs are not currently usable on the Polaris login nodes, so one can confirm the version of CUDA being used by testing in a batch or interactive job on a compute node.

Special notes for Polaris

On Polaris, there is a known bug where python applications launched with mpi and that use fork to spawn processes can sometimes have unexplaned hangs.  For this reason, it is recommended to use start_method=""spawn"" on Polaris when using the MpiExecLauncher as is shown in the example config above.  Alternatively, another solution is to use the GNUParallelLauncher which uses GNU Parallel to spawn processes.  GNU Parallel can be loaded in your environment with the command module load gnu-parallel.  Both of these approaches will circumvent the hang issue from using fork.

Updates

For parsl versions after July 2023, the address passed in the HighThroughputExecutor needs to be set to address = address_by_interface(""bond0"").  With parsl versions prior to July 2023, it was recommended to use address = address_by_hostname() on Polaris, but with later versions this will not work on Polaris (or any other machine).</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>In case you want write portable GPU kernels we highly recommend the KernelAbstractions.jl package. It provides a high-level abstraction for writing GPU kernels that can be compiled for different GPU backends.

julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(""KernelAbstractions"")'

By loading either oneAPI.jl, AMDGPU.jl, or CUDA.jl (see quickstart guide below).

CUDA-aware MPI

MPI.jl supports CUDA-aware MPI. This is enabled by setting the following environment variables.

bash
export JULIA_CUDA_MEMORY_POOL=none
export MPICH_GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED=1
export JULIA_MPI_PATH=${CRAY_MPICH_DIR}
export JULIA_MPI_HAS_CUDA=1

Note that MPI.jl needs to be rebuilt for the changes to take effect.

bash
julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.build(""MPI"")'

HDF5 Support

Parallel HDF5 support is provided by
module load cray-hdf5-parallel
After setting export JULIA_HDF5_PATH=$HDF5_DIR we can install the HDF5.jl package.

julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(""HDF5"")'

To remove warning messages indicating that use of JULIA_HDF5_PATH has been deprecated, one can use the following command to set the HDF5 libraries.

```
$ echo $CRAY_HDF5_PARALLEL_PREFIX/
/opt/cray/pe/hdf5-parallel/1.12.2.9/nvidia/23.3

$ julia --project -e 'using HDF5; HDF5.API.set_libraries!(""/opt/cray/pe/hdf5-parallel/1.12.2.9/nvidia/23.3/lib/libhdf5.so"", ""/opt/cray/pe/hdf5-parallel/1.12.2.9/nvidia/23.3/lib/libhdf5_hl.so"")'
```

Quickstart Guide

The following example shows how to use MPI.jl, CUDA.jl, and HDF5.jl to write a
parallel program that computes the sum of two vectors on the GPU and writes the
result to an HDF5 file. A repository with an example code computing an
approximation of pi can be found at
Polaris.jl. In this repository, you will also find
a setup_polaris.sh script that will build the HDF5.jl and MPI.jl package for the system libraries.
The dependencies are installed with the following commands:
bash
julia --project

julia

```julia
using CUDA

```

Configure and build it like this:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=CC -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=cc ..
make

Building a Kokkos Application Using make

Here's an example Makefile:

```

KOKKOS_HOME set via:

module load kokkos

You can look at the first lines of $KOKKOS_HOME/KokkosConfigCommon.cmake to

see the flags used in cmake configuration of the kokkos library build. The

default Kokkos module on Polaris was built with PrgEnv-nvhpc and includes

Serial, OpenMP (threads) and CUDA backends. So you should have that

environment module loaded and include compiler flags for cuda and openmp:

Cray MPI wrapper for C++ and C compilers:

CXX=CC
CC=cc

CPPFLAGS=-cuda -fopenmp
LDFLAGS=

LDFLAGS=$(CPPFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS)
LDLIBS=-L$(KOKKOS_HOME)/lib64 -lkokkoscore -lkokkossimd -lpthread

SRCS=example1.cpp
OBJS=$(subst .cpp,.o,$(SRCS))

all: example1_polaris

example1_polaris: $(OBJS)
        $(CXX) $(LDFLAGS) -o example1_polaris $(OBJS) $(LDLIBS)

clean:
        rm -f $(OBJS)

distclean: clean
        rm -f example1_polaris
```

Configuring Your Own Kokkos Build on Polaris

Here are recommended environment settings and configuration to build your own
kokkos libraries on Polaris:

Environment

To match what was done in the centrally-built kokkos associated with the
modules discussed above, use the programming environment
PrgEnv-gnu, and use the Cray wrapper CC as the C++ compiler. You'll also
need to explicitly load the Cuda toolkit version 12.2.91 as shown:</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>[""Parsl on Polaris\n\nParsl is a flexible and scalable parallel programming library for Python.\n\n-- Parsl Documentation\n\nFor many applications, managing an ensemble of jobs into a workflow is a critical step that can easily become a performance bottleneck.  Many tools exist to address this, of which parsl is just one.  On this page, we'll highlight some of the key pieces of information about parsl that are relevant to Polaris.  Parsl is also extensively documented, has a dedicated Slack Channel, and a large community of users and developers beyond ALCF.  We encourage you to engage with the parsl community for support with parsl specific questions, and for Polaris-specific questions or problems, please contact support@alcf.anl.gov.\n\nGetting Parsl on Polaris\n\nYou can install parsl building off of the conda modules.  You have some flexibility in how you want to extend the conda module to include parsl, but here is an example way to do it:\n\n```python\n\nLoad the Conda Module (needed everytime you use parsl)\n\nmodule load conda\nconda activate\n\nCreate a virtual env that uses the conda env as the system packages.\n\nOnly do the next line on initial set up:\n\npython -m venv --system-site-packages /path/to/your/virtualenv\n\nLoad the virtual env (every time):\n\nsource /path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/activate\n\nInstall parsl (only once)\n\npip install parsl\n\n```\n\nUsing Parsl on Polaris\n\nParsl has a variety of possible configuration settings.  As an example, we provide the configuration below that will run one task per GPU:\n\n```python\nfrom parsl.config import Config\n\nPBSPro is the right provider for Polaris:\n\nfrom parsl.providers import PBSProProvider\n\nThe high throughput executor is for scaling to HPC systems:\n\nfrom parsl.executors import HighThroughputExecutor\n\nYou can use the MPI launcher, but may want the Gnu Parallel launcher, see below\n\nfrom parsl.launchers import MpiExecLauncher, GnuParallelLauncher\n\naddress_by_interface is needed for the HighThroughputExecutor:"", 'data/md/polaris/workflows/parsl.md']</DOCUMENT>

KOKKOS package and NVHPC compilers

The following modules are useful for this particular build. Note, the cmake module is not required if using the GNU Makefile procedure to build LAMMPS. The initial module restore is just setting the default environment as the starting point. Users may find it useful to copy these module commands into a small helper script to assist with compiling and running LAMMPS (e.g. setup_lammps_nvhpc.sh).</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Use TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.  Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.  When possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention.

Use XLA compilation on your code.  XLA is the Accelerated Linear Algebra library that is available in tensorFlow and critical in software like JAX.  XLA will compile a tf.Graph object, generated with tf.function or similar, and perform optimizations like operation-fusion.  XLA can give impressive performance boosts with almost no user changes except to set an environment variable TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2.  If your code is complex, or has dynamically sized tensors (tensors where the shape changes every iteration), XLA can be detrimental: the overhead for compiling functions can be large enough to mitigate performance improvements.  XLA is particularly powerful when combined with reduced precision, yielding speedups > 100% in some models.

Multi-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up

TensorFlow is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with tensorFlow has been seen with horovod in particular.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation.  Some polaris specific details that may be helpful to you:

CPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.  In particular, we encourage users to try their scaling measurements with the following settings:

<DOCUMENT>Mapping Programming Models to Polaris Modules

The table below offers some suggestions for how to get started setting up your environment on Polaris depending on the programming language and model. Note, mixed C/C++ and Fortran applications should choose the programming environment for the Fortran compiler because of mpi.mod and similar incompatibilities between Fortran-generated files from different compilers. Several simple examples for testing the software environment on Polaris for different programming models are available in the ALCF GettingStart repo.

Note, users are encouraged to use PrgEnv-nvhpc instead of PrgEnv-nvidia as the latter will soon be deprecated in Cray's PE. They are otherwise identical pointing to compilers from the same NVIDIA SDK version.

Context: <DOCUMENT>Programming Models on Polaris

The software environment on Polaris supports several parallel programming models targeting the CPUs and GPUs.

CPU Parallel Programming Models

The Cray compiler wrappers cc, CC, and ftn are recommended for MPI applications as they provide the needed include paths and libraries for each programming environment. A summary of available CPU parallel programming models and relevant compiler flags is shown below. Users are encouraged to review the corresponding man pages and documentation.

Programming Model GNU NVHPC LLVM OpenMP -fopenmp -mp -fopenmp OpenACC -- -acc=multicore --

Higher-level programming models such as Kokkos and Raja may also be used for CPU programming.

GPU Programming Models

A summary of available GPU programming models and relevant compiler flags is shown below for compilers that generate offloadable code. Users are encouraged to review the corresponding man pages and documentation.

Programming Model GNU NVHPC LLVM ONEAPI CUDA -- -cuda [-gpu=cuda8.0,cc11.0] -- -- HIP* -- -- -- -- OpenACC -- -acc -- -- OpenCL* -- -- -- -- OpenMP -- -mp=gpu -fopenmp-targets=nvptx64 -- SYCL -- -- -- -fsycl -fsycl-targets=nvptx64-nvidia-cuda -Xsycl-target-backend --cuda-gpu-arch=sm_80

Note, the llvm and oneapi modules are provided by ALCF to complement the compilers provided by the Cray PE on Polaris.

Higher-level programming models such as Kokkos and Raja may also be used for GPU programming.

OpenCL is supported, but does not require specific compiler flags per-se as the offloaded kernels are just-in-time compiled. Abstraction programming models, such as Kokkos, can be built on top of some of these programming models (see below).

A HIP compiler supporting the A100 GPUs is still to be installed on Polaris.

<DOCUMENT>Mixed C/C++ & Fortran Applications

For applications consisting of a mix of C/C++ and Fortran that also uses MPI, it is suggested that the programming environment chosen for Fortran be used to build the full application because of mpi.mod (and similar) incompatibilities.

Compiling for GPUs

It is assumed the majority of applications to be built on Polaris will make use of the GPUs. As such, the craype-accel-nvidia80 module is in the default environment. This has the effect of the Cray compiler wrappers adding -gpu to the compiler invocation along with additional include paths and libraries. Additional compilers flags may be needed depending on the compiler and GPU programming model used (e.g. -cuda, -acc, or -mp=gpu).

This module also adds GPU Transport Layer (GTL) libraries to the link-line to support GPU-aware MPI applications.

ParaView module has been updated. For more information, see https://docs.alcf.anl.gov/polaris/visualization/paraview/ and https://docs.alcf.anl.gov/polaris/visualization/paraview-manual-launch/

Visit module is in the process of being updated.

Changes to Memory Limits on Login Nodes

Memory limits were lowered on the logins due to resource contention to 8GB of memory, and 8 cores per user. 
This might result in error messages indicating abnormal process termination for user processes run on logins.

Examples of the error messages people might see are:

nvcc error   : 'cudafe++' died due to signal 9 (Kill signal)

g++-12: fatal error: Killed signal terminated program cc1plus

These errors are likely due to exhausting the per-user resources on a login node as each user is allocated 8 cores and 8GB memory.
To avoid this you can either:

Reduce the parallelism of your compile, such as using -j or -j4 flags

Request a debug node and run your compile there where you will have the full resources of the node at your disposal</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>In case you want write portable GPU kernels we highly recommend the KernelAbstractions.jl package. It provides a high-level abstraction for writing GPU kernels that can be compiled for different GPU backends.

julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(""KernelAbstractions"")'

By loading either oneAPI.jl, AMDGPU.jl, or CUDA.jl (see quickstart guide below).

CUDA-aware MPI

MPI.jl supports CUDA-aware MPI. This is enabled by setting the following environment variables.

bash
export JULIA_CUDA_MEMORY_POOL=none
export MPICH_GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED=1
export JULIA_MPI_PATH=${CRAY_MPICH_DIR}
export JULIA_MPI_HAS_CUDA=1

Note that MPI.jl needs to be rebuilt for the changes to take effect.

bash
julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.build(""MPI"")'

HDF5 Support

Parallel HDF5 support is provided by
module load cray-hdf5-parallel
After setting export JULIA_HDF5_PATH=$HDF5_DIR we can install the HDF5.jl package.

julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(""HDF5"")'

To remove warning messages indicating that use of JULIA_HDF5_PATH has been deprecated, one can use the following command to set the HDF5 libraries.

```
$ echo $CRAY_HDF5_PARALLEL_PREFIX/
/opt/cray/pe/hdf5-parallel/1.12.2.9/nvidia/23.3

$ julia --project -e 'using HDF5; HDF5.API.set_libraries!(""/opt/cray/pe/hdf5-parallel/1.12.2.9/nvidia/23.3/lib/libhdf5.so"", ""/opt/cray/pe/hdf5-parallel/1.12.2.9/nvidia/23.3/lib/libhdf5_hl.so"")'
```

Quickstart Guide

The following example shows how to use MPI.jl, CUDA.jl, and HDF5.jl to write a
parallel program that computes the sum of two vectors on the GPU and writes the
result to an HDF5 file. A repository with an example code computing an
approximation of pi can be found at
Polaris.jl. In this repository, you will also find
a setup_polaris.sh script that will build the HDF5.jl and MPI.jl package for the system libraries.
The dependencies are installed with the following commands:

Kokkos

Kokkos Core implements a programming model in C++ for writing performance
portable applications targeting all major HPC platforms. For that purpose it
provides abstractions for both parallel execution of code and data
management. Kokkos is designed to target complex node architectures with
N-level memory hierarchies and multiple types of execution resources. It
currently can use Serial and OpenMP (threads) for CPU execution spaces
(""backends"") and CUDA, HIP, SYCL, and OpenMPTarget for GPU execution
spaces. By convention, Kokkos only allows one GPU backend at a time.

Kokkos on Polaris

Following the Polaris upgrade to HPCM
1.10,
the module setup to use the prebuilt Kokkos changed.

The prebuilt Kokkos on polaris includes 3 backends: Serial and OpenMP for CPU
execution and CUDA for GPU execution. To use it, run

module load craype-x86-milan
module load craype-accel-nvidia80
module swap PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-gnu
module use /soft/modulefiles
module load cuda-PrgEnv-nvidia/12.2.91
module load kokkos

This sets the following environment variables, some of which are used by
cmake:

KOKKOS_HOME - path to the lib64/, include/ files installed

LIBRARY_PATH - prepends $KOKKOS_HOME/lib64 to this variable used by cmake

CPATH - prepends $KOKKOS_HOME/include to this variable used by cmake

LD_LIBRARY_PATH - prepends $KOKKOS_HOME/lib64 to this variable

Building a Kokkos Application Using cmake

Add these lines to CMakeLists.txt:

find_package(Kokkos REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(myTarget Kokkos::kokkoscore)

Here is a simple example CMakeLists.txt to compile an example program:

```
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.22)

Context: <DOCUMENT>JAX

JAX is another popular python package for accelerated computing.  JAX is built on XLA (the same XLA TensorFlow uses) as well as AutoGrad, and additionally has acceleration tools that operate on functions such as vmap, jit, etc.  JAX is not as widespread in machine learning as TensorFlow and PyTorch for traditional models (Computer Vision, Language Models) though it is quickly gaining promienence.  JAX is very powerful when a program needs non-traditional autodifferentiation or vectorizatoin, such as: forward-mode AD, higher order derivatives, Jacobians, Hessians, or any combination of the above.  Users of JAX on Polaris are encouraged to read the user documentation in detail, particularly the details about pure-functional programming, no in-place operations, and the common mistakes in writing functions for the @jit decorator.

JAX on Polaris

JAX is installed on Polaris via the conda module, available with:
bash
module load conda; conda activate

Then, you can load JAX in python as usual (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):

```python

import jax
jax.version
'0.3.15'

```

Notes on JAX 0.3.15

On Polaris, due to a bug, an environment variable must be set to use JAX on GPUs.  The following code will crash:
python
import jax.numpy as numpy
a = numpy.zeros(1000)
outputting an error that looks like:
python
jaxlib.xla_extension.XlaRuntimeError: UNKNOWN: no kernel image is available for execution on the device

You can fix this by setting an environment variable:
bash
export XLA_FLAGS=""--xla_gpu_force_compilation_parallelism=1""

Scaling JAX to multiple GPUs and multiple Nodes

Jax has intrinsic scaling tools to use multiple GPUs on a single node, via the pmap function.  If this is sufficient for your needs, excellent.  If not, another alternative is to use the newer package mpi4jax.</DOCUMENT>

Context: <DOCUMENT>After you enter your password, a job will be queued and you will see a window like this:

When the job is launched on the compute nodes, the previous window will go away and ParaView will show it is connected to Polaris in its Pipeline Browser:

At this point you can open datasets stored on the ALCF file systems and use ParaView normally.

<DOCUMENT>OpenMM on Polaris

What is OpenMM?

OpenMM is a high-performance toolkit for molecular simulations that can be used as a stand-alone application or as a library. It provides a combination of flexibility (through custom forces and integrators), openness, and high-performance (especially on recent GPUs).

Using OpenMM at ALCF

ALCF offers assistance with building binaries and compiling instructions for OpenMM. For questions, contact us at support@alcf.anl.gov.

Building OpenMM using Conda module

Update environment
$ module load conda/2022-07-19

Install OpenMM
$ mkdir conda
$ conda create --prefix /path-to/conda/openmm_env
$ conda activate /path-to/conda/openmm_env
$ conda install -c conda-forge openmm cudatoolkit=11.4
$ conda deactivate /path-to/conda/openmm_env

Validate installation: if successful, then info on code version, platform types, CUDA initialization, and force error tolerance will be shown.

<DOCUMENT>Compilers provided by Cray Programming Environments

The default programming environment on Polaris is currently NVHPC. The GNU compilers are available via another programming environment. The following sequence of module commands can be used to switch to the GNU programming environment (gcc, g++, gfortran) and also have NVIDIA compilers available in your path.

module swap PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-gnu
module load nvhpc-mixed

The compilers invoked by the Cray MPI wrappers are listed for each programming environment in the following table.

module C C++ Fortran MPI Compiler Wrapper cc CC ftn PrgEnv-nvhpc nvc nvc++ nvfortran PrgEnv-gnu gcc g++ gfortran

Note, while gcc and g++ may be available in the default environment, the PrgEnv-gnu module is needed to provide gfortran.

Additional Compilers Provided by ALCF

The ALCF additionally provides compilers to enable the OpenMP and SYCL programming models for GPUs viaLLVM as documented here

Additional documentation for using compilers is available on the respective programming model pages: OpenMP and SYCL.

Linking

Dynamic linking of libraries is currently the default on Polaris. The Cray MPI wrappers will handle this automatically.

Notes on Default Modules

craype-x86-rome: While the Polaris compute nodes currently have Milan CPUs, this module is loaded by default to avoid the craype-x86-milan module from adding a zen3 target not supported in the default nvhpc/21.9 compilers. The craype-x86-milan module is expected to be made default once a newer nvhpc version (e.g. 22.5) is made the default.

craype-accel-nvidia80: This module adds compiler flags to enable GPU acceleration for NVHPC compilers along with gpu-enabled MPI libraries as it is assumed that the majority of applications to be compiled on Polaris will target the GPUs for acceleration. Users building cpu-only applications may find it useful to unload this module to silence ""gpu code generation"" warnings.

<DOCUMENT>Kokkos

Kokkos

Kokkos Core implements a programming model in C++ for writing performance
portable applications targeting all major HPC platforms. For that purpose it
provides abstractions for both parallel execution of code and data
management. Kokkos is designed to target complex node architectures with
N-level memory hierarchies and multiple types of execution resources. It
currently can use Serial and OpenMP (threads) for CPU execution spaces
(""backends"") and CUDA, HIP, SYCL, and OpenMPTarget for GPU execution
spaces. By convention, Kokkos only allows one GPU backend at a time.

Kokkos Documentation

Kokkos-core Wiki

Kokkos github

Kokkos on Polaris

Following the Polaris upgrade to HPCM
1.10,
the module setup to use the prebuilt Kokkos changed.

The prebuilt Kokkos on polaris includes 3 backends: Serial and OpenMP for CPU
execution and CUDA for GPU execution. To use it, run

module load craype-x86-milan
module load craype-accel-nvidia80
module swap PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-gnu
module use /soft/modulefiles
module load cuda-PrgEnv-nvidia/12.2.91
module load kokkos

This sets the following environment variables, some of which are used by
cmake:

KOKKOS_HOME - path to the lib64/, include/ files installed

LIBRARY_PATH - prepends $KOKKOS_HOME/lib64 to this variable used by cmake

CPATH - prepends $KOKKOS_HOME/include to this variable used by cmake

LD_LIBRARY_PATH - prepends $KOKKOS_HOME/lib64 to this variable

Building a Kokkos Application Using cmake

Add these lines to CMakeLists.txt:

find_package(Kokkos REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(myTarget Kokkos::kokkoscore)

Here is a simple example CMakeLists.txt to compile an example program:

```
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.22)
project(buildExample)
find_package(Kokkos REQUIRED)

set(buildExample_SOURCE_DIR ""."")

set(top_SRCS
  ${buildExample_SOURCE_DIR}/example1.cpp)

set(SOURCE_FILES ${top_SRCS})</DOCUMENT>

Verify that JULIA_DEPOT_PATH is set to the correct path and JULIA_PATH
points to the Julia executable. When using juliaup, the Julia executable is
located in the juliaup folder of your JULIA_DEPOT_PATH.

Large-scale parallelism

CUDA.jl uses the nvcc compiler to compile GPU kernels. This will create object files in the TEMP filesystem. The default TMPDIR in a job on Polaris is set to a temp directory that only exists on the head node of a job. We recommend setting TEMPDIR to a local directory on each compute node.
bash
export TMPDIR=/local/scratch

A simple example to test gpu-aware MPI on multiple nodes is available here.</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>bash
juliaup add release

Julia Project Environment

The Julia built-in package manager allows you to create a project and enable
project-specific dependencies. Julia manages packages in the Julia depot located
by default in ~/.julia. However, that NFS filesystem is not meant for
high-speed access. Therefore, this Julia depot folder should be located on a
fast filesystem of your choice (grand, eagle). The Julia depot directory is
set via the environment variable JULIA_DEPOT_PATH. For example, you can set
the Julia depot to a directory on Polaris grand filesystem by adding the following line
to your ~/.bashrc file:

bash
export JULIA_DEPOT_PATH=/grand/$PROJECT/$USER/julia_depot

Programming Julia on Polaris

There are three key components to using Julia for large-scale computations:

MPI support through MPI.jl

GPU support through CUDA.jl

HDF5 support through HDF5.jl

In addition, we recommend VSCode with the Julia
extension for a modern IDE experience, together
with the ssh-remote extension for remote interactive development.

MPI Support

MPI support is provided through the MPI.jl.
bash
$ julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(""MPI"")'
This will install the MPI.jl package and default MPI prebuilt binaries provided by an artifact. For on-node debugging purposes the default artifact is sufficient. However, for large-scale computations, it is important to use the Cray MPICH installed on Polaris. As of MPI.jl v0.20 this is handled through MPIPrefences.jl.
$ julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(""MPIPreferences"")'
$ julia --project -e 'using MPIPreferences; MPIPreferences.use_system_binary(vendor=""cray"")'

The vendor=""cray"" option is important if you intend to use gpu-aware MPI in your applications.

Check that the correct MPI library is targeted with Julia.
```
julia --project -e 'using MPI; MPI.versioninfo()'
MPIPreferences:
  binary:  system
  abi:     MPICH
  libmpi:  libmpi_nvidia.so
  mpiexec: mpiexec</DOCUMENT>

Context: <DOCUMENT>Spack PE

Spack is an HPC-oriented package manager which ALCF uses to install software for
the user environment.

ALCF's Spack PE is a Spack-managed software stack which provides various build
tools, utilities, and libraries. It consists of a base stack (spack-pe-base)
and PrgEnv-dependent stacks (currently spack-pe-gnu).

spack-pe-base contains commonplace software compiled for CPU with the system
GCC compilers. Accordingly, the software in spack-pe-base can be used
regardless of programming environment.

spack-pe-gnu is based on the E4S Project and
provides performant HPC libraries built with PrgEnv-gnu and the nvcc CUDA
compiler driver for GPU code. spack-pe-gnu is dependent on both
spack-pe-base and PrgEnv-gnu.

Using software from the Spack PE

The base suite of software tools and libraries can be accessed by loading the
spack-pe-base module. This adds a path to $MODULEPATH which contains
numerous modules.

For example, to load cmake starting from the default environment, a user
should run the following commands:
module use /soft/modulefiles
module load spack-pe-base
module load cmake

The spack-pe-base module adds paths to the user's MODULEPATH; individual packages are subsequently loaded through the newly available modules. The full list of available packages can be viewed by running module avail or module --show-hidden avail for a complete listing. Packages are loaded in the same way from spack-pe-gnu.

Inspecting packages

When a module in the Spack PE is loaded, several environment variables are
updated to integrate the package into the user's environment. Additionally, the
PACKAGE_ROOT variable is set to the path to the installation prefix of the
package. For example, after loading cmake as above:

$ echo $CMAKE_ROOT
/soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/install/linux-sles15-x86_64/gcc-12.3.0/cmake-3.27.7-a435jtzvweeos2es6enirbxdjdqhqgdp/
$ ls -a $CMAKE_ROOT
.  ..  bin  doc  share  .spack</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>libEnsemble

libEnsemble is a Python toolkit for running dynamic ensembles of calculations.

Users provide generator and simulator functions to express their ensembles, where the generator can steer the ensemble based on previous results. These functions can portably submit external executables at any scale.

System details are detected, and dynamic resource management is provided. This includes automatically detecting, assigning, and reassigning
GPUs for ensemble members.

libEnsemble can be used in a consistent manner on laptops, clusters, and supercomputers with minimal required dependencies.

Getting libEnsemble on Polaris

libEnsemble is provided on Polaris in the conda module:

See the docs for more details on using python on Polaris.

libEnsemble examples

For a very simple example of using libEnsemble see the Simple Introduction tutorial

For an example that runs a small ensemble using a C application (offloading work to the GPU), see
the GPU app tutorial.
The required files for this tutorial can be found
in this directory.
A video demo is also available.

Job Submission

libEnsemble runs on the compute nodes on Polaris using either Python's
multiprocessing or mpi4py. The user can set the number of workers for
maximum concurrency. libEnsemble will detect the nodes available
from the PBS environment and use these for running simulations. Polaris supports
running multiple concurrent simulations on each node if desired.

A simple example batch script for a libEnsemble use case that runs five workers on one node:

```shell
    #!/bin/bash -l
    #PBS -l select=1:system=polaris
    #PBS -l walltime=00:15:00
    #PBS -l filesystems=home:grand
    #PBS -q debug
    #PBS -A

```

The script can be run with:

<DOCUMENT>Julia

Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for
technical computing. It has a syntax familiar to users of many other
technical computing environments. Designed at MIT to tackle large-scale
partial-differential equation simulation and distributed linear algebra, Julia
features a robust ecosystem of tools for
optimization,
statistics, parallel programming, and data
visualization. Julia is actively developed by the Julia
Labs team at MIT and in
industry, along with hundreds of domain-expert
scientists and programmers worldwide.

This guide is a first draft of the Julia documentation for Polaris. If you have any
suggestions or contributions, please open a pull request or contact us by
opening a ticket at the ALCF Helpdesk.

Julia Installation

We encourage users interested in using Julia on Polaris to install in their home or project directories at this time. Using the official Julia 1.9 binaries from the Julia
webpage is recommended.
Juliaup provides a convenient way to
install Julia and manage the various Julia versions. The default installation will install julia, juliaup, and other commands in a ${HOME}/.julia directory and update profile files like .bashrc to update PATH to include that directory. One can customize the installation to change these defaults.

bash
module load craype-accel-nvidia80
curl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh

If you chose a custom installation, then be sure to update the PATH environment variable appropriately.

export PATH=${HOME}/.juliaup/bin:${PATH}

You may then list the available Julia versions with juliaup list and install a
specific version with juliaup install <version>. You can then activate a
specific version with juliaup use <version> and set the default version with
juliaup default <version>. juliaup update will update the installed Julia
versions. In general, the latest stable release of Julia should be used.

bash
juliaup add release

Context: <DOCUMENT>Programming Models on Polaris

The software environment on Polaris supports several parallel programming models targeting the CPUs and GPUs.

CPU Parallel Programming Models

The Cray compiler wrappers cc, CC, and ftn are recommended for MPI applications as they provide the needed include paths and libraries for each programming environment. A summary of available CPU parallel programming models and relevant compiler flags is shown below. Users are encouraged to review the corresponding man pages and documentation.

Programming Model GNU NVHPC LLVM OpenMP -fopenmp -mp -fopenmp OpenACC -- -acc=multicore --

Higher-level programming models such as Kokkos and Raja may also be used for CPU programming.

GPU Programming Models

A summary of available GPU programming models and relevant compiler flags is shown below for compilers that generate offloadable code. Users are encouraged to review the corresponding man pages and documentation.

Programming Model GNU NVHPC LLVM ONEAPI CUDA -- -cuda [-gpu=cuda8.0,cc11.0] -- -- HIP* -- -- -- -- OpenACC -- -acc -- -- OpenCL* -- -- -- -- OpenMP -- -mp=gpu -fopenmp-targets=nvptx64 -- SYCL -- -- -- -fsycl -fsycl-targets=nvptx64-nvidia-cuda -Xsycl-target-backend --cuda-gpu-arch=sm_80

Note, the llvm and oneapi modules are provided by ALCF to complement the compilers provided by the Cray PE on Polaris.

Higher-level programming models such as Kokkos and Raja may also be used for GPU programming.

OpenCL is supported, but does not require specific compiler flags per-se as the offloaded kernels are just-in-time compiled. Abstraction programming models, such as Kokkos, can be built on top of some of these programming models (see below).

A HIP compiler supporting the A100 GPUs is still to be installed on Polaris.

Context: <DOCUMENT>Notes

SmartSim workflows, such as online training, often require launching multiple MPI applications on the same set of nodes. On Polaris, the MPICH_OFI_CXI_PID_BASE=0 must be exported before the first call to mpiexec, and then incremented by 1 and re-exported before each successive call. This is done with the SmartSim API by adding env_vars={'MPICH_OFI_CXI_PID_BASE':str(0)} to the PalsMpiexecSettings() API.</DOCUMENT>

Cabana

Cabana is built atop Kokkos. It provides class templates useful for
implementing particle codes

Cabana on Polaris

Following the Polaris upgrade to HPCM
1.10,
the module setup to use the prebuilt Kokkos changed.

Built against the prebuilt Kokkos on
polaris, the prebuilt Cabana
includes 3 backends: Serial and OpenMP for CPU execution and CUDA for GPU
execution. To use it, run

module load craype-x86-milan
module load craype-accel-nvidia80
module swap PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-gnu
module use /soft/modulefiles
module load cuda-PrgEnv-nvidia/12.2.91
module load kokkos cabana

Cabana is a headers-only package; there are no actual libraries installed.</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Python

We provide prebuilt conda environments containing GPU-supported builds of
torch, tensorflow (both with horovod support for multi-node
calculations), jax, and many other commonly-used Python modules.

Users can activate this environment by first loading the conda module, and
then activating the base environment.

Explicitly (either from an interactive job, or inside a job script):

bash
module use /soft/modulefiles; module load conda ; conda activate base

This will load and activate the base environment.

Virtual environments via venv

To install additional packages that are missing from the base environment,
we can build a venv on top of it.

!!! success ""Conda base environment + venv""

You can always retroactively change the #!bash --system-site-packages flag
state for this virtual environment by editing #!bash ${VENV_DIR}/pyvenv.cfg and
changing the value of the line #!bash include-system-site-packages=false.

To install a different version of a package that is already installed in the
base environment, you can use:

bash
python3 pip install --ignore-installed <package> # or -I

The shared base environment is not writable, so it is impossible to remove or
uninstall packages from it. The packages installed with the above pip command
should shadow those installed in the base environment.

Cloning the base Anaconda environment

!!! warning

If you need more flexibility, you can clone the conda environment into a custom
path, which would then allow for root-like installations via #!bash conda install
<module> or #!bash pip install <module>.

Unlike the venv approach, using a cloned Anaconda environment requires you to
copy the entirety of the base environment, which can use significant storage
space.

To clone the base environment:

bash
module load conda ; conda activate base
conda create --clone base --prefix /path/to/envs/base-clone
conda activate /path/to/envs/base-clone

where, #!bash path/to/envs/base-clone should be replaced by a suitably chosen
path.</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>ImageMagick on Polaris

To use ImageMagick on Polaris first load the corresponding module:

module use /soft/modulefiles

Context: <DOCUMENT>Compilers provided by Cray Programming Environments

The default programming environment on Polaris is currently NVHPC. The GNU compilers are available via another programming environment. The following sequence of module commands can be used to switch to the GNU programming environment (gcc, g++, gfortran) and also have NVIDIA compilers available in your path.

module swap PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-gnu
module load nvhpc-mixed

The compilers invoked by the Cray MPI wrappers are listed for each programming environment in the following table.

module C C++ Fortran MPI Compiler Wrapper cc CC ftn PrgEnv-nvhpc nvc nvc++ nvfortran PrgEnv-gnu gcc g++ gfortran

Note, while gcc and g++ may be available in the default environment, the PrgEnv-gnu module is needed to provide gfortran.

Additional Compilers Provided by ALCF

The ALCF additionally provides compilers to enable the OpenMP and SYCL programming models for GPUs viaLLVM as documented here

Additional documentation for using compilers is available on the respective programming model pages: OpenMP and SYCL.

Linking

Dynamic linking of libraries is currently the default on Polaris. The Cray MPI wrappers will handle this automatically.

Notes on Default Modules

craype-x86-rome: While the Polaris compute nodes currently have Milan CPUs, this module is loaded by default to avoid the craype-x86-milan module from adding a zen3 target not supported in the default nvhpc/21.9 compilers. The craype-x86-milan module is expected to be made default once a newer nvhpc version (e.g. 22.5) is made the default.

craype-accel-nvidia80: This module adds compiler flags to enable GPU acceleration for NVHPC compilers along with gpu-enabled MPI libraries as it is assumed that the majority of applications to be compiled on Polaris will target the GPUs for acceleration. Users building cpu-only applications may find it useful to unload this module to silence ""gpu code generation"" warnings.

Mixed C/C++ & Fortran Applications</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>GNU Compilers on Polaris

The GNU compilers are available on Polaris via the PrgEnv-gnu and gcc-mixed modules. The gcc-mixed module can be useful when, for example, the PrgEnv-nvhpc compilers are used to compile C/C++ MPI-enabled code and gfortran is needed.

The GNU compilers currently on Polaris do not support GPU code generation and thus can only be used for compiling CPU codes.

The nvhpc and llvm compilers can be used for compiling GPU-enabled applications.</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>In case you want write portable GPU kernels we highly recommend the KernelAbstractions.jl package. It provides a high-level abstraction for writing GPU kernels that can be compiled for different GPU backends.

julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(""KernelAbstractions"")'

By loading either oneAPI.jl, AMDGPU.jl, or CUDA.jl (see quickstart guide below).

CUDA-aware MPI

MPI.jl supports CUDA-aware MPI. This is enabled by setting the following environment variables.

bash
export JULIA_CUDA_MEMORY_POOL=none
export MPICH_GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED=1
export JULIA_MPI_PATH=${CRAY_MPICH_DIR}
export JULIA_MPI_HAS_CUDA=1

Note that MPI.jl needs to be rebuilt for the changes to take effect.

bash
julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.build(""MPI"")'

HDF5 Support

Parallel HDF5 support is provided by
module load cray-hdf5-parallel
After setting export JULIA_HDF5_PATH=$HDF5_DIR we can install the HDF5.jl package.

julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(""HDF5"")'

To remove warning messages indicating that use of JULIA_HDF5_PATH has been deprecated, one can use the following command to set the HDF5 libraries.

```
$ echo $CRAY_HDF5_PARALLEL_PREFIX/
/opt/cray/pe/hdf5-parallel/1.12.2.9/nvidia/23.3

$ julia --project -e 'using HDF5; HDF5.API.set_libraries!(""/opt/cray/pe/hdf5-parallel/1.12.2.9/nvidia/23.3/lib/libhdf5.so"", ""/opt/cray/pe/hdf5-parallel/1.12.2.9/nvidia/23.3/lib/libhdf5_hl.so"")'
```

Quickstart Guide

The following example shows how to use MPI.jl, CUDA.jl, and HDF5.jl to write a
parallel program that computes the sum of two vectors on the GPU and writes the
result to an HDF5 file. A repository with an example code computing an
approximation of pi can be found at
Polaris.jl. In this repository, you will also find
a setup_polaris.sh script that will build the HDF5.jl and MPI.jl package for the system libraries.
The dependencies are installed with the following commands:
bash
julia --project

Note 3: All of these queues have a limit of one hundred (100) jobs queued (not accruing score) per-project

Note 4: As of January 2023, it is recommended to submit jobs with a maximum node count of 476-486 nodes given current rates of downed nodes (larger jobs may sit in the queue indefinitely).

Running MPI+OpenMP Applications

Once a submitted job is running calculations can be launched on the compute nodes using mpiexec to start an MPI application. Documentation is accessible via man mpiexec and some helpful options follow.

-n total number of MPI ranks

-ppn number of MPI ranks per node

--cpu-bind CPU binding for application

--depth number of cpus per rank (useful with --cpu-bind)

--env set environment variables (--env OMP_NUM_THREADS=2)

--hostfile indicate file with hostnames (the default is --hostfile $PBS_NODEFILE)

A sample submission script with directives is below for a 4-node job with 8 MPI ranks on each node and 8 OpenMP threads per rank. Each hardware thread runs a single OpenMP thread since there are 64 hardware threads on the CPU (2 per core).
You can download and compile hello_affinity from this link.

```bash

!/bin/bash -l

PBS -N AFFINITY

PBS -l select=4:ncpus=256

PBS -l walltime=0:10:00

PBS -q debug-scaling

PBS -A Catalyst  # Replace with your project

Using pip install --user (not recommended)

!!! danger

With the conda environment setup, one can install common Python modules using
#!bash python3 pip install --users '<module-name>' which will install
packages in #!bash $PYTHONUSERBASE/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages.

The #!bash $PYTHONUSERBASE environment variable is automatically set when you
load the base conda module, and is equal to  #!bash
/home/$USER/.local/polaris/conda/YYYY-MM-DD.

Note, Python modules installed this way that contain command line binaries will
not have those binaries automatically added to the shell's #!bash $PATH. To
manually add the path:

bash
export PATH=""$PYTHONUSERBASE/bin:$PATH""

Be sure to remove this location from #!bash $PATH if you deactivate the base
Anaconda environment or unload the module.

With the conda environment setup, one can install common Python modules using
#!bash python3 pip install --users '<module-name>' which will install
packages in #!bash $PYTHONUSERBASE/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages.

The #!bash $PYTHONUSERBASE environment variable is automatically set when you
load the base conda module, and is equal to  #!bash
/home/$USER/.local/polaris/conda/YYYY-MM-DD.

Note, Python modules installed this way that contain command line binaries will
not have those binaries automatically added to the shell's #!bash $PATH. To
manually add the path:

bash
export PATH=""$PYTHONUSERBASE/bin:$PATH""

Be sure to remove this location from #!bash $PATH if you deactivate the base

<DOCUMENT>Manually launching a ParaView server on Polaris

Sometimes it is convenient to manually launch an instance of the ParaView server. In this section we will explain an alternative method to run the ParaView server on Polaris using an interactive job, where the user can launch the ParaView server from the command line interface.

Note: this is a method better suited for experienced users. If you are just starting with ParaView, we recommend the client/server mode as your primary method for using this tool.

Setting up ParaView

From your local client select Connect, either from the File menu, or by clicking on the icon circled below:

A new window will open where you can configure a server. Click on Add Server:

Give your server a name, select Client/Server, localhost, and a TCP port (8000 in this example)

Click ""Configure"". In the next window there is an option to set up how ParaView server will be launched, and the default is ""Manual"". Leave it on ""Manual"" and click ""Save"".

You will use these settings when establishing the connection.

Launching the ParaView server on Polaris

You can launch an interactive session on Polaris compute nodes with the following command (adjust parameters as needed to match your allocation, desired number of nodes, queue, walltime, and filesystems):

shell
qsub -l walltime=01:00:00 -l select=2 -A yourallocation -q debug -I -l filesystems=home:grand

When the job starts you will receive a prompt on your head node like this:

username@x3005c0s7b0n0:~>

Make a note of the node hostname (x3005c0s7b0n0 in the example above). You can also get this information from qstat -fx jobID

Now load the ParaView module

username@x3005c0s7b0n0:~> module use /soft/modulefiles 
username@x3005c0s7b0n0:~> module load visualization/paraview/paraview-5.12.0-EGL

The table below offers some suggestions for how to get started setting up your environment on Polaris depending on the programming language and model. Note, mixed C/C++ and Fortran applications should choose the programming environment for the Fortran compiler because of mpi.mod and similar incompatibilities between Fortran-generated files from different compilers. Several simple examples for testing the software environment on Polaris for different programming models are available in the ALCF GettingStart repo.

Note, users are encouraged to use PrgEnv-nvhpc instead of PrgEnv-nvidia as the latter will soon be deprecated in Cray's PE. They are otherwise identical pointing to compilers from the same NVIDIA SDK version.

<DOCUMENT>Kokkos

Kokkos

Kokkos Core implements a programming model in C++ for writing performance
portable applications targeting all major HPC platforms. For that purpose it
provides abstractions for both parallel execution of code and data
management. Kokkos is designed to target complex node architectures with
N-level memory hierarchies and multiple types of execution resources. It
currently can use Serial and OpenMP (threads) for CPU execution spaces
(""backends"") and CUDA, HIP, SYCL, and OpenMPTarget for GPU execution
spaces. By convention, Kokkos only allows one GPU backend at a time.

Kokkos on Polaris

Following the Polaris upgrade to HPCM
1.10,
the module setup to use the prebuilt Kokkos changed.

The prebuilt Kokkos on polaris includes 3 backends: Serial and OpenMP for CPU
execution and CUDA for GPU execution. To use it, run

module load craype-x86-milan
module load craype-accel-nvidia80
module swap PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-gnu
module use /soft/modulefiles
module load cuda-PrgEnv-nvidia/12.2.91
module load kokkos

This sets the following environment variables, some of which are used by
cmake:

KOKKOS_HOME - path to the lib64/, include/ files installed

LIBRARY_PATH - prepends $KOKKOS_HOME/lib64 to this variable used by cmake

CPATH - prepends $KOKKOS_HOME/include to this variable used by cmake

LD_LIBRARY_PATH - prepends $KOKKOS_HOME/lib64 to this variable

Building a Kokkos Application Using cmake

Add these lines to CMakeLists.txt:

find_package(Kokkos REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(myTarget Kokkos::kokkoscore)

Here is a simple example CMakeLists.txt to compile an example program:

```
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.22)

<DOCUMENT>This variable can be used to inspect software installations and find header or
library paths. Additionally, Spack packages have a .spack directory in the
installation prefix which contains build information and logs.

Building software with Spack

Spack is a powerful package manager designed for HPC.
The Spack PE is installed and managed with Spack; users can also install Spack
in their own home or project directory to manage their software builds. Spack
has a steep learning curve, but it may benefit workflows involving frequent
builds with complex dependencies.

For users who wish to use Spack to install their own software, we provide
configuration files corresponding to the Spack PE deployments. These
configuration files can be found in config directories in /soft/spack within
the respective Spack PE installation directories. For example, the
spack-pe-base/0.6.1 configurations are in /soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/config. Not
all of these settings will be useful for all builds and it is not recommended to
adopt these wholesale as global settings. The recommended method is to include
these settings ad hoc in a spack environment to control what information spack
uses for its builds.

Support requests and feedback should be directed to
support@alcf.anl.gov. For general Spack
questions, users are encouraged to consult the following resources:

Context: <DOCUMENT>Polaris System Updates

2024-04-22

The management software on Polaris has been upgraded to HPCM 1.10
The following version changes are in place with the upgrade to HPCM 1.10:

HPE Cray Programming Environment (CPE) 23.12

SlingShot version 2.1.2

NVIDIA SDK 23.9

NVIDIA driver version 535.154.05

CUDA 12.2

SUSE 15 SP5

Releasing jobs

Jobs that were queued before the upgrade have been restored to the appropriate queues but are placed on user hold. 
Jobs are not expected to complete successfully due to the changes made to the system and software environments resulting from the upgrade. 
We recommend you review your jobs and either release the hold (qrls <jobid>) or delete it (qdel <jobid>) and resubmit as appropriate.

Users need to rebuild for the new PE environment and major OS upgrade. Existing binaries are unlikely to run successfully.

We have held all jobs submitted prior to the upgrade as a user hold. Users may release their existing jobs with qrls to run after they have rebuilt their binaries.

PBS does cache the job execution script.  If a change to the script is required due to a path changing post rebuild, the job will have to be resubmitted.

All application binaries should be rebuilt prior to further job submissions.

Re-building user codes

Many user codes will need to be re-built and/or re-linked against the newer version of the programming environment (23.12) and Spack provided dependencies.

Changes to the user software environment

In addition to the system upgrades, several changes have been made to the user
software environment which may impact user workflows.

Older PE versions removed

Older versions of the Cray PE (older than 23.12) are deprecated as they are incompatible with the
upgraded system stack and are no longer available for use.

<DOCUMENT>FFmpeg on Polaris

NOTE: FFmpeg module is currently missing on Polaris after a recent upgrade. A spack build of ffmpeg will be available soon

To use FFmpeg on Polaris first load the corresponding module:

module load ffmpeg

This is a typical command line to create a movie from a series of snapshots in PNG format:

ffmpeg -r 15 -i frames.%03d.png -r 25 -pix_fmt yuv420p movie.mp4

where:

r 15 is the input frame rate. Experiment with values smaller than the output frame rate for longer movies.
-r 25 is the output frame rate (use this value for standard 25 frames per second)
-i frames.%03d.png reads the input frames in sequence
-pix_fmt yuv420p is needed for movies to play in browsers
movie.mp4 is the resulting movie</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>OpenMP

Overview

The OpenMP API is an open standard for parallel programming. The specification document can be found here: https://www.openmp.org. The specification describes directives, runtime routines, and environment variables that allow an application developer to express parallelism (e.g. shared memory multiprocessing and device offloading). Many compiler vendors provide implementations of the OpenMP specification (https://www.openmp.org/specifications).

Setting the environment to use OpenMP on Polaris

Many of the programming environments available on Polaris have OpenMP support.

module OpenMP CPU support? OpenMP GPU support? PrgEnv-nvhpc yes yes llvm yes yes PrgEnv-gnu yes no PrgEnv-cray yes yes*

Currently PrgEnv-cray is not recommended for OpenMP offload.

By default, the PrgEnv-nvhpc module is loaded. To switch to other modules, you can use module switch.

Using PrgEnv-nvhpc

This is loaded by default, so there's no need to load additional modules. You can confirm that it is loaded by running module list to check that PrgEnv-nvhpc is in the list.

Using LLVM

To use the LLVM module, load the following.
module load mpiwrappers/cray-mpich-llvm
module load cudatoolkit-standalone

See the the LLVM compiling page here for more information.

Using PrgEnv-gnu

To switch from PrgEnv-nvhpc to PrgEnv-gnu you can run:

module switch PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-gnu

The gcc/gfortran on Polaris was not built with GPU support. To use OpenMP on the CPU, you need to unload craype-accel-nvidia80:

module unload craype-accel-nvidia80

Using PrgEnv-cray

To switch from PrgEnv-nvhpc to PrgEnv-cray you can run:

module switch PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-cray

To use OpenMP on the CPU only, also unload craype-accel-nvidia80:

module unload craype-accel-nvidia80

To use OpenMP on the GPU, load cudatoolkit-standalone, although this is not recommended at the moment.
module load cudatoolkit-standalone

GPU Support

NVIDIA GPU support is provided through the CUDA.jl package. The default in Julia is to download artifacts (e.g. CUDA toolkit) based on the runtime detected. While that should generally work, it is recommended to use the local CUDA installation provided on Polaris especially if using gpu-aware MPI in your workloads (important to use supported versions of CUDA with Cray MPICH provided).

To use the local CUDA installation provided by the modules on Polaris, the LocalPreferences.toml file can be modified as follows.

$ head $JULIA_DEPOT_PATH/environments/v1.10/LocalPreferences.toml

$ julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(""CUDA"")'

The GPUs are not currently usable on the Polaris login nodes, so one can confirm the version of CUDA being used by testing in a batch or interactive job on a compute node.

<DOCUMENT>ParaView Tutorial

Overview

This tutorial is intended to be a hands-on resource for users interested in learning the basic concepts of ParaView. The examples can easily be run on a laptop, using the example data set provided.

Tour of ParaView

Show range of visualization methods

Walk through various visualization techniques, hopefully illustrate how these can apply to your own data

Feel for ParaView ""way""

Terminology and step-by-step process peculiar to ParaView, which may differ from other packages, e.g. VisIt

Data

The data used for this tutorial is:
- Blood flow simulation data
- Multiple data types
  - Continuum data field (unstructured mesh, tetrahedral): fluid field, plasma
  - Particle data (unstructured points): individual particles moving in the flow
  - Red Blood Cells (RBC, unstructured mesh, triangle): mesh of the surface of an RBC
    - Healthy
    - Diseased
- Generated using an integrated Nektar/LAMMPS simulation code
- Courtesy of George Karniadakis and Leopold Grinberg of Brown University

The data is available for download here (~27MB compressed, ~39MB uncompressed):
Data set for ParaView Red Blood Cell Tutorial

1. Load Multi-component Dataset

From the Filemenu, (you can also click the file folder icon, shown above) open each of the following data sets (select then click ""OK"")

The files will then appear in the Pipeline Browser

Click Apply in the Object Inspector

You will need to do this one at a time:

continuum...vtu

particles...vtu

rbc_...vtu

bad_rbc...vtu
Note: The ""..."" in the name, and the arrow in the file browser, indicates that there are multiple time steps for each of these files

2. Select which data to view</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>DeepSpeed

The base conda environment on Polaris comes with Microsoft's
DeepSpeed pre-installed. Instructions
for using / cloning the base environment can be found here.

A batch submission script for the following example is available
here.

We describe below the steps needed to get started with DeepSpeed on Polaris.

We focus on the cifar example provided in the
DeepSpeedExamples repository,
though this approach should be generally applicable for running any model with
DeepSpeed support.

Running DeepSpeed on Polaris

!!! note

Load conda module and activate base environment:
bash
module load conda ; conda activate base

Clone
   microsoft/DeepSpeedExamples
   and navigate into the directory:
bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeedExamples.git
cd DeepSpeedExamples/cifar

!!! example ""Launching DeepSpeed""

???- bug ""AssertionError: Micro batch sizer per gpu: 0 has to be greater than 0""</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>2. Select which data to view

Let's start by looking at the continuum.000*data. This is an unstructured mesh that has velocity and count (density) values.
- Hide other data sets using the Eyeball icon next their names in the Pipeline Browser.
  - Black = visible, Grey = hidden
- Select continuum.000*(name is highlighted) in the Pipeline Browser
  - Click on the name to highlight it
- When manipulating appearance or applying filters, these always affect the selected data set
- Switch to the Display tab in the Object Inspector
- Under Color by, select Velocity from the dropdown
  - There is also a shortcut to Color by in the menu bar near the top of the GUI
  -

3. Manipulating the Color Map

To change the colors used to represent the Velocity:
- Under Color byclick the Edit Color Map... button
- On the Color Scale Editor window click the Choose Preset button
- On the Preset Color Scales window, select: Blue to Red Rainbow, and click OK. Then click Close on the Color Scale Editor window
- You can also create and save your own color maps

4. Data Representation

In order to be able to see the particles and red blood cells inside the cylinder, we need to be able to see through it. If we scroll down a bit in the Object Inspector view:
- Group of controls labeled Style
- In the Representation dropdown, select Wireframe

5. Generate Streamlines

ParaView enables the generation of different types of data from existing data sets in the Pipeline

Streamlines: Generated from vectors of the flow field. These curves show the direction a fluid element will travel in at any point in time

Make sure that the continuum.000*data is selected in the Pipeline Browser

From the main menu select: Filters->Alphabetical->Stream Tracer, or click on the Stream Tracer icon from the menu bar

In the Object Inspector make sure the Properties tab is selected.

Scroll down to seeds, and change Seed Type to Line Source

Click the Y Axis button to set the seed line to run along the Y axis.</DOCUMENT>

PyTorch Best Practices on Polaris

Single Node Performance

When running PyTorch applications, we have found the following practices to be generally, if not universally, useful and encourage you to try some of these techniques to boost performance of your own applications.</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>QMCPACK on Polaris

QMCPACK, is a modern high-performance open-source Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation code. Its main applications are electronic structure calculations of molecular, quasi-2D and solid-state systems. Variational Monte Carlo (VMC), diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) and a number of other advanced QMC algorithms are implemented. Orbital space auxiliary field QMC (AFQMC) has recently been added. By directly solving the Schrodinger equation, QMC methods offer greater accuracy than methods such as density functional theory, but at a trade-off of much greater computational expense.

Prebuilt executables are provided at /soft/applications/qmcpack.
The directory of each installation also includes a job submission script example qmcpack-polaris.job.
Update build recipe is provided on GitHub.</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Megatron-DeepSpeed

<DOCUMENT>JAX

JAX is another popular python package for accelerated computing.  JAX is built on XLA (the same XLA TensorFlow uses) as well as AutoGrad, and additionally has acceleration tools that operate on functions such as vmap, jit, etc.  JAX is not as widespread in machine learning as TensorFlow and PyTorch for traditional models (Computer Vision, Language Models) though it is quickly gaining promienence.  JAX is very powerful when a program needs non-traditional autodifferentiation or vectorizatoin, such as: forward-mode AD, higher order derivatives, Jacobians, Hessians, or any combination of the above.  Users of JAX on Polaris are encouraged to read the user documentation in detail, particularly the details about pure-functional programming, no in-place operations, and the common mistakes in writing functions for the @jit decorator.

JAX on Polaris

JAX is installed on Polaris via the conda module, available with:
bash
module load conda; conda activate

Then, you can load JAX in python as usual (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):

```python

import jax
jax.version
'0.3.15'

```

Notes on JAX 0.3.15

On Polaris, due to a bug, an environment variable must be set to use JAX on GPUs.  The following code will crash:
python
import jax.numpy as numpy
a = numpy.zeros(1000)
outputting an error that looks like:
python
jaxlib.xla_extension.XlaRuntimeError: UNKNOWN: no kernel image is available for execution on the device

You can fix this by setting an environment variable:
bash
export XLA_FLAGS=""--xla_gpu_force_compilation_parallelism=1""

Scaling JAX to multiple GPUs and multiple Nodes

Jax has intrinsic scaling tools to use multiple GPUs on a single node, via the pmap function.  If this is sufficient for your needs, excellent.  If not, another alternative is to use the newer package mpi4jax.</DOCUMENT>

located in the juliaup folder of your JULIA_DEPOT_PATH.

Large-scale parallelism

CUDA.jl uses the nvcc compiler to compile GPU kernels. This will create object files in the TEMP filesystem. The default TMPDIR in a job on Polaris is set to a temp directory that only exists on the head node of a job. We recommend setting TEMPDIR to a local directory on each compute node.
bash
export TMPDIR=/local/scratch

<DOCUMENT>Known Issues

This is a collection of known issues that have been encountered on Polaris. Documentation will be updated as issues are resolved. Users are encouraged to email support@alcf.anl.gov to report issues.

Submitting Jobs

For batch job submissions, if the parameters within your submission script do not meet the parameters of any of the execution queues (small, ..., backfill-large) you might not receive the ""Job submission"" error on the command line at all, and the job will never appear in history qstat -xu <username> (current bug in PBS). E.g. if a user submits a script to the prod routing queue requesting 10 nodes for 24 hours, exceeding ""Time Max"" of 6 hrs of the small execution queue (which handles jobs with 10-24 nodes), then it may behave as if the job was never submitted.

Job scripts are copied to temporary locations after qsub and any changes to the original script while the job is queued will not be reflected in the copied script. Furthermore, qalter requires -A <allocation name> when changing job properties. Currently, there is a request for a qalter-like command to trigger a re-copy of the original script to the temporary location.

<DOCUMENT>Use Reduced Precision. Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with PyTorch operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the PyTorch Automatic Mixed Precision package (AMP), as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  In PyTorch, users generally need to manage casting and loss scaling manually,  though context managers and function decorators can provide easy tools to do this.

PyTorch has a JIT module as well as backends to support op fusion, similar to TensorFlow's tf.function tools.  However, PyTorch JIT capabilities are newer and may not yield performance improvements.  Please see TorchScript for more information.

Multi-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up

PyTorch is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with PyTorch has been seen with both DDP and Horovod.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation or the Distributed Data Parallel documentation.  Some Polaris-specific details that may be helpful to you:

CPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.  In particular, we encourage users to try their scaling measurements with the following settings:

Set the environment variable NCCL_COLLNET_ENABLE=1

Set the environment varialbe NCCL_NET_GDR_LEVEL=PHB

Manually set the CPU affinity via mpiexec, such as with --cpu-bind verbose,list:0,8,16,24</DOCUMENT>

<DOCUMENT>Gateway nodes

There are 50 gateway nodes.  These nodes are not user accessible, but are used transparently for access to the storage systems.  Each node has a single 200 Gbps HDR IB card for access to the storage area network.  This gives a theoretical peak bandwidth of 1250 GB/s which is approximately the aggregate bandwidth of the global file systems (1300 GB/s).

Storage

Polaris has access to the ALCF global file systems.  Details on storage can be found here.</DOCUMENT>

Building a Kokkos Application Using make

Here's an example Makefile:

```

KOKKOS_HOME set via:

module load kokkos

You can look at the first lines of $KOKKOS_HOME/KokkosConfigCommon.cmake to

see the flags used in cmake configuration of the kokkos library build. The

default Kokkos module on Polaris was built with PrgEnv-nvhpc and includes

Serial, OpenMP (threads) and CUDA backends. So you should have that

environment module loaded and include compiler flags for cuda and openmp:

Cray MPI wrapper for C++ and C compilers:

CXX=CC
CC=cc

CPPFLAGS=-cuda -fopenmp
LDFLAGS=

LDFLAGS=$(CPPFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS)
LDLIBS=-L$(KOKKOS_HOME)/lib64 -lkokkoscore -lkokkossimd -lpthread

SRCS=example1.cpp
OBJS=$(subst .cpp,.o,$(SRCS))

all: example1_polaris

example1_polaris: $(OBJS)
        $(CXX) $(LDFLAGS) -o example1_polaris $(OBJS) $(LDLIBS)

clean:
        rm -f $(OBJS)

distclean: clean
        rm -f example1_polaris
```

Configuring Your Own Kokkos Build on Polaris

Here are recommended environment settings and configuration to build your own
kokkos libraries on Polaris:

Environment

To match what was done in the centrally-built kokkos associated with the
modules discussed above, use the programming environment
PrgEnv-gnu, and use the Cray wrapper CC as the C++ compiler. You'll also
need to explicitly load the Cuda toolkit version 12.2.91 as shown:</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Click the Y Axis button to set the seed line to run along the Y axis.

The default Resolution is set to 100. This will make things a bit cluttered, especially when we start adding in the other data, so let's reduce this to 25

Click the Apply button

6. Streamlines as Tubes

The streamlines are just that, lines. We can use the Tubes filter to represent them as 3D objects, rather than just lines.
- With StreamTracer1selected in the Pipeline Browser, from the main menu select: Filters->Alphabetical->Tube
- In the Object Inspector make sure the Properties tab is selected
- The default value for the Radius is a bit too large for this data, let's set that value to 0
- Click the Apply button
- Notice that the StreamLine1 object has automatically been hidden
- There are many different ways to color these tubes
- With Tubes1 selected, switch to the Display tab in the Object Inspector
- The Color bydropdown lets you choose from a handful of different variables

7. Cutting Planes (Slices)

Now let's add some cutting plans, or slices, to see what the cross-section of the continuum data looks like.
- Again, be sure that the continuum.000*data is selected in the Pipeline Browser
- Filters->Alphabetical->Slice or Click on the Slice icon from the menu bar
- In the Object Inspector make sure the Propertiestab is selected
- At the bottom on the Object Inspector is a section titled Slice Offset Values. Here we can generate values for multiple slices to be made
- First click the Delete All button to remove initial values
- Next, click the New Range button. This will bring up an Add Range dialog box.
- Set the number of Steps to 7. Click OK
- Click the Apply button
- With Slice1 selected in the Object Inspector, switch to the Display tab
- Set Color by value to Velocity

8. Data Representation: Opacity</DOCUMENT>

User: How does Automatic Mixed Precision package (AMP) work in PyTorch?
Assistant: AMP works in PyTorch by allowing users to manage casting and loss scaling manually, while following the steps outlined in the mixed precision documentation.

Context: <DOCUMENT>In case you want write portable GPU kernels we highly recommend the KernelAbstractions.jl package. It provides a high-level abstraction for writing GPU kernels that can be compiled for different GPU backends.

julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(""KernelAbstractions"")'

By loading either oneAPI.jl, AMDGPU.jl, or CUDA.jl (see quickstart guide below).

CUDA-aware MPI

MPI.jl supports CUDA-aware MPI. This is enabled by setting the following environment variables.

bash
export JULIA_CUDA_MEMORY_POOL=none
export MPICH_GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED=1
export JULIA_MPI_PATH=${CRAY_MPICH_DIR}
export JULIA_MPI_HAS_CUDA=1

Note that MPI.jl needs to be rebuilt for the changes to take effect.

bash
julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.build(""MPI"")'

HDF5 Support

Parallel HDF5 support is provided by
module load cray-hdf5-parallel
After setting export JULIA_HDF5_PATH=$HDF5_DIR we can install the HDF5.jl package.

julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(""HDF5"")'

To remove warning messages indicating that use of JULIA_HDF5_PATH has been deprecated, one can use the following command to set the HDF5 libraries.

```
$ echo $CRAY_HDF5_PARALLEL_PREFIX/
/opt/cray/pe/hdf5-parallel/1.12.2.9/nvidia/23.3

$ julia --project -e 'using HDF5; HDF5.API.set_libraries!(""/opt/cray/pe/hdf5-parallel/1.12.2.9/nvidia/23.3/lib/libhdf5.so"", ""/opt/cray/pe/hdf5-parallel/1.12.2.9/nvidia/23.3/lib/libhdf5_hl.so"")'
```

Quickstart Guide

The following example shows how to use MPI.jl, CUDA.jl, and HDF5.jl to write a
parallel program that computes the sum of two vectors on the GPU and writes the
result to an HDF5 file. A repository with an example code computing an
approximation of pi can be found at
Polaris.jl. In this repository, you will also find
a setup_polaris.sh script that will build the HDF5.jl and MPI.jl package for the system libraries.
The dependencies are installed with the following commands:

To run a container on Polaris you can use the submission script described here. Below is an explanation of the job submission script.

```bash

!/bin/sh

PBS -l select=2:system=polaris

PBS -q debug

PBS -l place=scatter

PBS -l walltime=0:30:00

PBS -l filesystems=home:grand

PBS -A

cd ${PBS_O_WORKDIR}
echo $CONTAINER
```

We move to current working directory and enable network access at run time by setting the proxy. We also load apptainer.

```bash

SET proxy for internet access</DOCUMENT>

Set the environment varialbe NCCL_NET_GDR_LEVEL=PHB

Manually set the CPU affinity via mpiexec, such as with --cpu-bind verbose,list:0,8,16,24

Horovod works best when you limit the visible devices to only one GPU.  Note that if you import mpi4py or horovod, and then do something like os.environ[""CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES""] = hvd.local_rank(), it may not actually work!  You must set the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable prior to doing MPI.COMM_WORLD.init(), which is done in horovod.init() as well as implicitly in from mpi4py import MPI.   On Polaris specifically, you can use the environment variable PMI_LOCAL_RANK (as well as PMI_LOCAL_SIZE) to learn information about the node-local MPI ranks.

Julia Project Environment

The Julia built-in package manager allows you to create a project and enable
project-specific dependencies. Julia manages packages in the Julia depot located
by default in ~/.julia. However, that NFS filesystem is not meant for
high-speed access. Therefore, this Julia depot folder should be located on a
fast filesystem of your choice (grand, eagle). The Julia depot directory is
set via the environment variable JULIA_DEPOT_PATH. For example, you can set
the Julia depot to a directory on Polaris grand filesystem by adding the following line
to your ~/.bashrc file:

bash
export JULIA_DEPOT_PATH=/grand/$PROJECT/$USER/julia_depot

Programming Julia on Polaris

There are three key components to using Julia for large-scale computations:

MPI support through MPI.jl

GPU support through CUDA.jl

HDF5 support through HDF5.jl

In addition, we recommend VSCode with the Julia
extension for a modern IDE experience, together
with the ssh-remote extension for remote interactive development.

MPI Support

MPI support is provided through the MPI.jl.
bash
$ julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(""MPI"")'
This will install the MPI.jl package and default MPI prebuilt binaries provided by an artifact. For on-node debugging purposes the default artifact is sufficient. However, for large-scale computations, it is important to use the Cray MPICH installed on Polaris. As of MPI.jl v0.20 this is handled through MPIPrefences.jl.
$ julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(""MPIPreferences"")'
$ julia --project -e 'using MPIPreferences; MPIPreferences.use_system_binary(vendor=""cray"")'

The vendor=""cray"" option is important if you intend to use gpu-aware MPI in your applications.

Check that the correct MPI library is targeted with Julia.
```
julia --project -e 'using MPI; MPI.versioninfo()'
MPIPreferences:
  binary:  system
  abi:     MPICH
  libmpi:  libmpi_nvidia.so

<DOCUMENT>SmartSim and SmartRedis

SmartSim is an open source tool developed by the Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) designed to facilitate the integration of traditional HPC simulation applications with machine learning workflows.
There are two core components to SmartSim:

Infrastructure library (IL)
Provides API to start, stop and monitor HPC applications from Python
Interfaces with the scheduler launch jobs (PBSPro on Polaris and Cobalt on Theta/ThetaGPU)
Deploys a distributed in-memory database called the Orchestrator

SmartRedis client library
Provides clients that connect to the Orchestrator from Fortran, C, C++, Python code
The client API library enables data transfer to/from database and ability to load and run JIT-traced Python and ML runtimes acting on stored data

For more resources on SmartSim, follow the links below:

<DOCUMENT>Notes

SmartSim workflows, such as online training, often require launching multiple MPI applications on the same set of nodes. On Polaris, the MPICH_OFI_CXI_PID_BASE=0 must be exported before the first call to mpiexec, and then incremented by 1 and re-exported before each successive call. This is done with the SmartSim API by adding env_vars={'MPICH_OFI_CXI_PID_BASE':str(0)} to the PalsMpiexecSettings() API.</DOCUMENT>

Let's also switch to the Display tab in the Object Inspector, with Glyph1 selected, and change the Color by value to GlyphVector. Since the GlyphVector value is based on the velocity. We can Edit Color Map...and choose the same Blue to Red Rainbow preset that we previously chose for velocity

12. Enter: Red Blood Cells

Now let's add in both of the other data sets, which are polygonal meshes which make up Red Blood Cells (RBCs).

These two data sets are essentially the same kind of data, so we can apply the same filters and make the same types of representation changes to each of them. However, some of the RBCs are marked by the simulation that generated them as healthy (rbc.000) and some of them are marked as diseased (bad_rbc.000).

Unhide the rbc.000 and bad_rbc.000 data sets by clicking the Eye icon next to each of them to make them visible

13. Using Color to Differentiate Data

To enable us to distinguish these two types of data from one other, we can vary their representations.

One way to do this is by setting the color of the two data sets to different colors. Repeat this process for each of rbc.000 and bad_rbc.000, picking different colors.

Select one of the rbc data sets in the Pipeline Browser

<DOCUMENT>Gromacs on Polaris

What is Gromacs?

GROMACS is a versatile package to perform molecular dynamics, i.e. simulate the Newtonian equations of motion for systems with hundreds to millions of particles. It is primarily designed for biochemical molecules like proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids that have a lot of complicated bonded interactions, but since GROMACS is extremely fast at calculating the nonbonded interactions (that usually dominate simulations) many groups are also using it for research on non-biological systems, e.g. polymers.

Using GROMACS at ALCF

ALCF offers assistance with building binaries and compiling instructions for GROMACS. For questions, contact us at support@alcf.anl.gov.

<DOCUMENT>Parsl on Polaris

Parsl is a flexible and scalable parallel programming library for Python.

-- Parsl Documentation

For many applications, managing an ensemble of jobs into a workflow is a critical step that can easily become a performance bottleneck.  Many tools exist to address this, of which parsl is just one.  On this page, we'll highlight some of the key pieces of information about parsl that are relevant to Polaris.  Parsl is also extensively documented, has a dedicated Slack Channel, and a large community of users and developers beyond ALCF.  We encourage you to engage with the parsl community for support with parsl specific questions, and for Polaris-specific questions or problems, please contact support@alcf.anl.gov.

Getting Parsl on Polaris

You can install parsl building off of the conda modules.  You have some flexibility in how you want to extend the conda module to include parsl, but here is an example way to do it:

```python

Load the Conda Module (needed everytime you use parsl)

module load conda
conda activate

Create a virtual env that uses the conda env as the system packages.

Only do the next line on initial set up:

python -m venv --system-site-packages /path/to/your/virtualenv

Load the virtual env (every time):

source /path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/activate

Install parsl (only once)

pip install parsl

```

Using Parsl on Polaris

Parsl has a variety of possible configuration settings.  As an example, we provide the configuration below that will run one task per GPU:

```python
from parsl.config import Config

PBSPro is the right provider for Polaris:

from parsl.providers import PBSProProvider

The high throughput executor is for scaling to HPC systems:

from parsl.executors import HighThroughputExecutor

You can use the MPI launcher, but may want the Gnu Parallel launcher, see below

from parsl.launchers import MpiExecLauncher, GnuParallelLauncher

address_by_interface is needed for the HighThroughputExecutor:</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>JAX

JAX is another popular python package for accelerated computing.  JAX is built on XLA (the same XLA TensorFlow uses) as well as AutoGrad, and additionally has acceleration tools that operate on functions such as vmap, jit, etc.  JAX is not as widespread in machine learning as TensorFlow and PyTorch for traditional models (Computer Vision, Language Models) though it is quickly gaining promienence.  JAX is very powerful when a program needs non-traditional autodifferentiation or vectorizatoin, such as: forward-mode AD, higher order derivatives, Jacobians, Hessians, or any combination of the above.  Users of JAX on Polaris are encouraged to read the user documentation in detail, particularly the details about pure-functional programming, no in-place operations, and the common mistakes in writing functions for the @jit decorator.

JAX on Polaris

JAX is installed on Polaris via the conda module, available with:
bash
module load conda; conda activate

Then, you can load JAX in python as usual (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):

```python

import jax
jax.version
'0.3.15'

```

Notes on JAX 0.3.15

On Polaris, due to a bug, an environment variable must be set to use JAX on GPUs.  The following code will crash:
python
import jax.numpy as numpy
a = numpy.zeros(1000)
outputting an error that looks like:
python
jaxlib.xla_extension.XlaRuntimeError: UNKNOWN: no kernel image is available for execution on the device

You can fix this by setting an environment variable:
bash
export XLA_FLAGS=""--xla_gpu_force_compilation_parallelism=1""

Scaling JAX to multiple GPUs and multiple Nodes

Jax has intrinsic scaling tools to use multiple GPUs on a single node, via the pmap function.  If this is sufficient for your needs, excellent.  If not, another alternative is to use the newer package mpi4jax.</DOCUMENT>

The craype-accel-nvidia80 module in the default environment will add the -gpu compiler flag for nvhpc compilers along with appropriate include directories and libraries. It is left to the user to provide an additional flag to the nvhpc compilers to select the target GPU programming model. In this case, -cuda is used to indicate compilation of CUDA code. The application can then be launched within a batch job submission script or as follows on one of the compute nodes.

```
$ ./vecadd

<DOCUMENT>OpenMM on Polaris

What is OpenMM?

OpenMM is a high-performance toolkit for molecular simulations that can be used as a stand-alone application or as a library. It provides a combination of flexibility (through custom forces and integrators), openness, and high-performance (especially on recent GPUs).

User: How do you install JAX on Polaris using conda?
Assistant: Install JAX on Polaris using conda by loading the conda module and activating the conda environment.
    "
"System: This is a chat between a user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions based on the context. The assistant should also indicate when the answer cannot be found in the context.
Context: <DOCUMENT>JAX

JAX is another popular python package for accelerated computing.  JAX is built on XLA (the same XLA TensorFlow uses) as well as AutoGrad, and additionally has acceleration tools that operate on functions such as vmap, jit, etc.  JAX is not as widespread in machine learning as TensorFlow and PyTorch for traditional models (Computer Vision, Language Models) though it is quickly gaining promienence.  JAX is very powerful when a program needs non-traditional autodifferentiation or vectorizatoin, such as: forward-mode AD, higher order derivatives, Jacobians, Hessians, or any combination of the above.  Users of JAX on Polaris are encouraged to read the user documentation in detail, particularly the details about pure-functional programming, no in-place operations, and the common mistakes in writing functions for the @jit decorator.

JAX on Polaris

JAX is installed on Polaris via the conda module, available with:
bash
module load conda; conda activate

Then, you can load JAX in python as usual (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):

```python

import jax
jax.version
'0.3.15'

```

Notes on JAX 0.3.15

On Polaris, due to a bug, an environment variable must be set to use JAX on GPUs.  The following code will crash:
python
import jax.numpy as numpy
a = numpy.zeros(1000)
outputting an error that looks like:
python
jaxlib.xla_extension.XlaRuntimeError: UNKNOWN: no kernel image is available for execution on the device

You can fix this by setting an environment variable:
bash
export XLA_FLAGS=""--xla_gpu_force_compilation_parallelism=1""

Scaling JAX to multiple GPUs and multiple Nodes

Jax has intrinsic scaling tools to use multiple GPUs on a single node, via the pmap function.  If this is sufficient for your needs, excellent.  If not, another alternative is to use the newer package mpi4jax.</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Instructions for gpt-neox:

We include below a set of instructions to get EleutherAI/gpt-neox running on Polaris.

A batch submission script for the following example is available here.

!!! warning ""Warning""

Load and activate the base conda environment:
  bash
  module load conda
  conda activate base

We've installed the requirements for running gpt-neox into a virtual
   environment. To activate this environment,
  bash
  source /soft/datascience/venvs/polaris/2022-09-08/bin/activate

Clone the EleutherAI/gpt-neox repository if it doesn't already exist:
  bash
  git clone https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neox

Navigate into the gpt-neox directory:
  bash
  cd gpt-neox


  Note
  The remaining instructions assume you're inside the gpt-neox directory

Create a DeepSpeed compliant hostfile (each line is formatted as hostname, slots=N):
  bash
  cat $PBS_NODEFILE > hostfile
  sed -e 's/$/ slots=4/' -i hostfile
  export DLTS_HOSTFILE=hostfile

Create a .deepspeed_env file to ensure a consistent environment across all
   workers
   bash
   echo ""PATH=${PATH} > .deepspeed_env""
   echo ""LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH} >> .deepspeed_env""
   echo ""http_proxy=${http_proxy} >> .deepspeed_env""
   echo ""https_proxy=${https_proxy} >> .deepspeed_env""

<DOCUMENT>GNU Compilers on Polaris

The GNU compilers are available on Polaris via the PrgEnv-gnu and gcc-mixed modules. The gcc-mixed module can be useful when, for example, the PrgEnv-nvhpc compilers are used to compile C/C++ MPI-enabled code and gfortran is needed.

The GNU compilers currently on Polaris do not support GPU code generation and thus can only be used for compiling CPU codes.

The nvhpc and llvm compilers can be used for compiling GPU-enabled applications.</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Compiling and Linking Overview on Polaris

Compiling on Polaris Login and Compute Nodes

If your build system does not require GPUs for the build process, as is usually the case, compilation of GPU-accelerated codes is generally expected to work well on the Polaris login nodes. If your build system does require GPUs, you cannot yet compile on the Polaris login nodes, as they do not currently have GPUs installed. You may in this case compile your applications on the Polaris compute nodes. Do this by submitting an interactive single-node job, or running your build system in a batch job.

Home File System

Is it helpful to realize that there is a single HOME filesystem for users that can be accessed from the login and computes of each production resource at ALCF. Thus, users should be mindful of modifications to their environments (e.g. .bashrc) that may cause issues to arise due to differences between the systems.

Cray Programming Environment

The Cray Programming Environment (PE) uses three compiler wrappers for building software. These compiler wrappers should be used when building MPI-enabled applications.

cc - C compiler

CC - C++ compiler

ftn - Fortran compiler

Each of these wrappers can select a specific vendor compiler based on the PrgEnv module loaded in the environment. The following are some helpful options to understand what the compiler wrapper is invoking.

--craype-verbose : Print the command which is forwarded to the compiler invocation

--cray-print-opts=libs : Print library information

--cray-print-opts=cflags : Print include information

The output from these commands may be useful in build scripts where a compiler other than that invoked by a compiler wrapper is desired. Defining some variables as such may prove useful in those situations.
CRAY_CFLAGS=$(cc --cray-print-opts=cflags)
CRAY_LIB=$(cc --cray-print-opts=libs)
Further documentation and options are available via man cc and similar.

Compilers provided by Cray Programming Environments</DOCUMENT>

User: Why does setting an environment variable like XLA_FLAGS=""--xla_gpu_force_compilation_parallelism=1"" resolve an error when running JAX code?
Assistant: Setting the environment variable `XLA_FLAGS` with the value `--xla_gpu_force_compilation_parallelism=1` resolves the error when running JAX code because it allows JAX to compile and execute kernels on the GPU, which is necessary for JAX's acceleration features.

The default Resolution is set to 100. This will make things a bit cluttered, especially when we start adding in the other data, so let's reduce this to 25

Click the Apply button

6. Streamlines as Tubes

The streamlines are just that, lines. We can use the Tubes filter to represent them as 3D objects, rather than just lines.
- With StreamTracer1selected in the Pipeline Browser, from the main menu select: Filters->Alphabetical->Tube
- In the Object Inspector make sure the Properties tab is selected
- The default value for the Radius is a bit too large for this data, let's set that value to 0
- Click the Apply button
- Notice that the StreamLine1 object has automatically been hidden
- There are many different ways to color these tubes
- With Tubes1 selected, switch to the Display tab in the Object Inspector
- The Color bydropdown lets you choose from a handful of different variables

7. Cutting Planes (Slices)

Now let's add some cutting plans, or slices, to see what the cross-section of the continuum data looks like.
- Again, be sure that the continuum.000*data is selected in the Pipeline Browser
- Filters->Alphabetical->Slice or Click on the Slice icon from the menu bar
- In the Object Inspector make sure the Propertiestab is selected
- At the bottom on the Object Inspector is a section titled Slice Offset Values. Here we can generate values for multiple slices to be made
- First click the Delete All button to remove initial values
- Next, click the New Range button. This will bring up an Add Range dialog box.
- Set the number of Steps to 7. Click OK
- Click the Apply button
- With Slice1 selected in the Object Inspector, switch to the Display tab
- Set Color by value to Velocity

Login nodes

There are four login nodes available to users for editing code, building code, submitting / monitoring jobs, checking usage (sbank), etc..  Their full hostnames are polaris-login-N.hsn.cm.polaris.alcf.anl.gov  for N equal to 01 through 04; there are an additional two login nodes that are not user-accessible which are used for running services such as JupyterHub. The various compilers and libraries are present on the logins, so most users should be able to build their code.  However, if your build requires the physical presence of the GPU, you will need to build on a compute node.

All users share the same login nodes so please be courteous and respectful of your fellow users.  For example, please do not run computationally or IO intensive pre- or post-processing on the logins and keep the parallelism of your builds to a reasonable level.

POLARIS LOGIN DESCRIPTION PER NODE AGGREGATE Processor (Note 1) 2.0 GHz 7713 2 12 Cores/Threads AMD Zen 3 (Milan) 128/256 768/1536 RAM (Note 2) DDR4 512 GiB 3 TiB GPUs (Note 3) No GPUs 0 0 Local SSD None 0 0

import jax.numpy as jnp
import mpi4jax

comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD
rank = comm.Get_rank()
local_rank = int(os.environ[""PMI_LOCAL_RANK""])

available_devices = jax.devices(""gpu"")
if len(available_devices) <= local_rank:
    raise Exception(""Could not find enough GPUs"")

target_device = available_devices[local_rank]

@jax.jit
def foo(arr):
   arr = arr + rank
   arr_sum, _ = mpi4jax.allreduce(arr, op=MPI.SUM, comm=comm)
   return arr_sum

with jax.default_device(target_device):
    a = jnp.zeros((3, 3))

<DOCUMENT>QMCPACK on Polaris

QMCPACK, is a modern high-performance open-source Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation code. Its main applications are electronic structure calculations of molecular, quasi-2D and solid-state systems. Variational Monte Carlo (VMC), diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) and a number of other advanced QMC algorithms are implemented. Orbital space auxiliary field QMC (AFQMC) has recently been added. By directly solving the Schrodinger equation, QMC methods offer greater accuracy than methods such as density functional theory, but at a trade-off of much greater computational expense.

Prebuilt executables are provided at /soft/applications/qmcpack.
The directory of each installation also includes a job submission script example qmcpack-polaris.job.

<DOCUMENT>mpi4Jax is a relatively new project and requires setting some environment variables for good performance and usability:
- Set MPI4JAX_USE_CUDA_MPI=1 to use CUDA-Aware MPI, supported in the conda module, to do operations directly from the GPU.
- Set MPICH_GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED=1 to use CUDA-Aware MPI.

The following code, based off of a test script from the mpi4jax repository, can help you verify you are using mpi4jax properly:

```python

import jax.numpy as jnp
import mpi4jax

comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD
rank = comm.Get_rank()
local_rank = int(os.environ[""PMI_LOCAL_RANK""])

if len(available_devices) <= local_rank:
    raise Exception(""Could not find enough GPUs"")

target_device = available_devices[local_rank]

Context: <DOCUMENT>TensorFlow on Polaris

TensorFlow is a popular, open-source deep learning framework developed and released by Google.  The TensorFlow home page has more information about TensorFlow, which you can refer to.  For trouble shooting on Polaris, please contact support@alcf.anl.gov.

Installation on Polaris

TensorFlow is already pre-installed on Polaris, available in the conda module.  To use it from a compute node, please do:

bash
module load conda
conda activate

Then, you can load TensorFlow in python as usual (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):

```python

import tensorflow as tf
tf.version
'2.9.1'

```

This installation of TensorFlow was built from source and the CUDA libraries it uses are found via the CUDA_HOME environment variable (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):

bash
$ echo $CUDA_HOME
/soft/datascience/cuda/cuda_11.5.2_495.29.05_linux

If you need to build applications that use this version of TensorFlow and CUDA, we recommend using these cuda libraries to ensure compatibility.  We periodically update the TensorFlow release, though updates will come in the form of new versions of the conda module.

TensorFlow is also available through NVIDIA containers that have been translated to Singularity containers.  For more information about containers, please see the Containers documentation page.

TensorFlow Best Practices on Polaris

Single Node Performance

When running TensorFlow applications, we have found the following practices to be generally, if not universally, useful and encourage you to try some of these techniques to boost performance of your own applications.

Use Reduced Precision. Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with TensorFlow operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the tf.keras.mixed_precision Policy, as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  If you use a custom training loop (and not keras.Model.fit), you will also need to apply loss scaling.</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Megatron-DeepSpeed

We describe below the instructions for launching distributed training with
Microsoft's Megatron-DeepSpeed and briefly describe some parallelism

<DOCUMENT>Compiling and Linking Overview on Polaris

Compiling on Polaris Login and Compute Nodes

If your build system does not require GPUs for the build process, as is usually the case, compilation of GPU-accelerated codes is generally expected to work well on the Polaris login nodes. If your build system does require GPUs, you cannot yet compile on the Polaris login nodes, as they do not currently have GPUs installed. You may in this case compile your applications on the Polaris compute nodes. Do this by submitting an interactive single-node job, or running your build system in a batch job.

Home File System

Is it helpful to realize that there is a single HOME filesystem for users that can be accessed from the login and computes of each production resource at ALCF. Thus, users should be mindful of modifications to their environments (e.g. .bashrc) that may cause issues to arise due to differences between the systems.

Cray Programming Environment

The Cray Programming Environment (PE) uses three compiler wrappers for building software. These compiler wrappers should be used when building MPI-enabled applications.

cc - C compiler

CC - C++ compiler

ftn - Fortran compiler

Each of these wrappers can select a specific vendor compiler based on the PrgEnv module loaded in the environment. The following are some helpful options to understand what the compiler wrapper is invoking.

--craype-verbose : Print the command which is forwarded to the compiler invocation

--cray-print-opts=libs : Print library information

--cray-print-opts=cflags : Print include information

The output from these commands may be useful in build scripts where a compiler other than that invoked by a compiler wrapper is desired. Defining some variables as such may prove useful in those situations.
CRAY_CFLAGS=$(cc --cray-print-opts=cflags)
CRAY_LIB=$(cc --cray-print-opts=libs)
Further documentation and options are available via man cc and similar.

Context: <DOCUMENT>Programming Models on Polaris

The software environment on Polaris supports several parallel programming models targeting the CPUs and GPUs.

CPU Parallel Programming Models

The Cray compiler wrappers cc, CC, and ftn are recommended for MPI applications as they provide the needed include paths and libraries for each programming environment. A summary of available CPU parallel programming models and relevant compiler flags is shown below. Users are encouraged to review the corresponding man pages and documentation.

Programming Model GNU NVHPC LLVM OpenMP -fopenmp -mp -fopenmp OpenACC -- -acc=multicore --

Higher-level programming models such as Kokkos and Raja may also be used for CPU programming.

GPU Programming Models

A summary of available GPU programming models and relevant compiler flags is shown below for compilers that generate offloadable code. Users are encouraged to review the corresponding man pages and documentation.

Programming Model GNU NVHPC LLVM ONEAPI CUDA -- -cuda [-gpu=cuda8.0,cc11.0] -- -- HIP* -- -- -- -- OpenACC -- -acc -- -- OpenCL* -- -- -- -- OpenMP -- -mp=gpu -fopenmp-targets=nvptx64 -- SYCL -- -- -- -fsycl -fsycl-targets=nvptx64-nvidia-cuda -Xsycl-target-backend --cuda-gpu-arch=sm_80

Note, the llvm and oneapi modules are provided by ALCF to complement the compilers provided by the Cray PE on Polaris.

Higher-level programming models such as Kokkos and Raja may also be used for GPU programming.

OpenCL is supported, but does not require specific compiler flags per-se as the offloaded kernels are just-in-time compiled. Abstraction programming models, such as Kokkos, can be built on top of some of these programming models (see below).

A HIP compiler supporting the A100 GPUs is still to be installed on Polaris.

Mapping Programming Models to Polaris Modules</DOCUMENT>

```

Verify that JULIA_DEPOT_PATH is set to the correct path and JULIA_PATH
points to the Julia executable. When using juliaup, the Julia executable is
located in the juliaup folder of your JULIA_DEPOT_PATH.

Large-scale parallelism

CUDA.jl uses the nvcc compiler to compile GPU kernels. This will create object files in the TEMP filesystem. The default TMPDIR in a job on Polaris is set to a temp directory that only exists on the head node of a job. We recommend setting TEMPDIR to a local directory on each compute node.
bash
export TMPDIR=/local/scratch

A simple example to test gpu-aware MPI on multiple nodes is available here.</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>ParaView and Visit

ParaView module has been updated. For more information, see https://docs.alcf.anl.gov/polaris/visualization/paraview/ and https://docs.alcf.anl.gov/polaris/visualization/paraview-manual-launch/

Visit module is in the process of being updated.

Changes to Memory Limits on Login Nodes

Memory limits were lowered on the logins due to resource contention to 8GB of memory, and 8 cores per user. 
This might result in error messages indicating abnormal process termination for user processes run on logins.

Examples of the error messages people might see are:

nvcc error   : 'cudafe++' died due to signal 9 (Kill signal)

g++-12: fatal error: Killed signal terminated program cc1plus

These errors are likely due to exhausting the per-user resources on a login node as each user is allocated 8 cores and 8GB memory.
To avoid this you can either:

Reduce the parallelism of your compile, such as using -j or -j4 flags

Request a debug node and run your compile there where you will have the full resources of the node at your disposal</DOCUMENT>

Spack is an HPC-oriented package manager which ALCF uses to install software for
the user environment.

ALCF's Spack PE is a Spack-managed software stack which provides various build
tools, utilities, and libraries. It consists of a base stack (spack-pe-base)
and PrgEnv-dependent stacks (currently spack-pe-gnu).

spack-pe-base contains commonplace software compiled for CPU with the system
GCC compilers. Accordingly, the software in spack-pe-base can be used
regardless of programming environment.

spack-pe-gnu is based on the E4S Project and
provides performant HPC libraries built with PrgEnv-gnu and the nvcc CUDA
compiler driver for GPU code. spack-pe-gnu is dependent on both
spack-pe-base and PrgEnv-gnu.

Using software from the Spack PE

The base suite of software tools and libraries can be accessed by loading the
spack-pe-base module. This adds a path to $MODULEPATH which contains
numerous modules.

For example, to load cmake starting from the default environment, a user
should run the following commands:
module use /soft/modulefiles
module load spack-pe-base
module load cmake

The spack-pe-base module adds paths to the user's MODULEPATH; individual packages are subsequently loaded through the newly available modules. The full list of available packages can be viewed by running module avail or module --show-hidden avail for a complete listing. Packages are loaded in the same way from spack-pe-gnu.

Inspecting packages

When a module in the Spack PE is loaded, several environment variables are
updated to integrate the package into the user's environment. Additionally, the
PACKAGE_ROOT variable is set to the path to the installation prefix of the
package. For example, after loading cmake as above:

$ echo $CMAKE_ROOT
/soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/install/linux-sles15-x86_64/gcc-12.3.0/cmake-3.27.7-a435jtzvweeos2es6enirbxdjdqhqgdp/
$ ls -a $CMAKE_ROOT
.  ..  bin  doc  share  .spack</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>ParaView and Visit

ParaView module has been updated. For more information, see https://docs.alcf.anl.gov/polaris/visualization/paraview/ and https://docs.alcf.anl.gov/polaris/visualization/paraview-manual-launch/

Visit module is in the process of being updated.

Changes to Memory Limits on Login Nodes

Memory limits were lowered on the logins due to resource contention to 8GB of memory, and 8 cores per user. 
This might result in error messages indicating abnormal process termination for user processes run on logins.

Examples of the error messages people might see are:

nvcc error   : 'cudafe++' died due to signal 9 (Kill signal)

g++-12: fatal error: Killed signal terminated program cc1plus

These errors are likely due to exhausting the per-user resources on a login node as each user is allocated 8 cores and 8GB memory.
To avoid this you can either:

Reduce the parallelism of your compile, such as using -j or -j4 flags

Request a debug node and run your compile there where you will have the full resources of the node at your disposal</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>TensorFlow on Polaris

TensorFlow is a popular, open-source deep learning framework developed and released by Google.  The TensorFlow home page has more information about TensorFlow, which you can refer to.  For trouble shooting on Polaris, please contact support@alcf.anl.gov.

Installation on Polaris

TensorFlow is already pre-installed on Polaris, available in the conda module.  To use it from a compute node, please do:

bash
module load conda
conda activate

Then, you can load TensorFlow in python as usual (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):

```python

import tensorflow as tf
tf.version
'2.9.1'

```

This installation of TensorFlow was built from source and the CUDA libraries it uses are found via the CUDA_HOME environment variable (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):

bash
$ echo $CUDA_HOME
/soft/datascience/cuda/cuda_11.5.2_495.29.05_linux

If you need to build applications that use this version of TensorFlow and CUDA, we recommend using these cuda libraries to ensure compatibility.  We periodically update the TensorFlow release, though updates will come in the form of new versions of the conda module.

TensorFlow is also available through NVIDIA containers that have been translated to Singularity containers.  For more information about containers, please see the Containers documentation page.

TensorFlow Best Practices on Polaris

Single Node Performance

When running TensorFlow applications, we have found the following practices to be generally, if not universally, useful and encourage you to try some of these techniques to boost performance of your own applications.

Use Reduced Precision. Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with TensorFlow operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the tf.keras.mixed_precision Policy, as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  If you use a custom training loop (and not keras.Model.fit), you will also need to apply loss scaling.</DOCUMENT>

User: How do I ensure compatibility when building applications that use this version of TensorFlow and CUDA?
Assistant: Use the same CUDA libraries found via `CUDA_HOME` and monitor updates to ensure compatibility.
    "
"System: This is a chat between a user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions based on the context. The assistant should also indicate when the answer cannot be found in the context.
Context: <DOCUMENT>Use TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.  Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.  When possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention.

Use XLA compilation on your code.  XLA is the Accelerated Linear Algebra library that is available in tensorFlow and critical in software like JAX.  XLA will compile a tf.Graph object, generated with tf.function or similar, and perform optimizations like operation-fusion.  XLA can give impressive performance boosts with almost no user changes except to set an environment variable TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2.  If your code is complex, or has dynamically sized tensors (tensors where the shape changes every iteration), XLA can be detrimental: the overhead for compiling functions can be large enough to mitigate performance improvements.  XLA is particularly powerful when combined with reduced precision, yielding speedups > 100% in some models.

Multi-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up

TensorFlow is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with tensorFlow has been seen with horovod in particular.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation.  Some polaris specific details that may be helpful to you:

CPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.  In particular, we encourage users to try their scaling measurements with the following settings:

Set the environment variable NCCL_COLLNET_ENABLE=1</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>3. Use ParaView

After the previous step, you can now select POLARIS@ANL in the File->Connect menu and press Connect

At this point a new window will pop up

There are a number of parameters that you must enter manually here:

Xterm executable: the path of a terminal on your system. The figure shows the case of a Mac with XQuartz. You may need to change these values for Windows or Linux.

SSH executable: the name of your ssh command. It may be different on Windows depending on the ssh client installed (i.e putty)

Remote machine: leave this value at polaris.alcf.anl.gov

Username: your ALCF user name

ParaView version: the version of Paraview that you want to use. Verify first that this version is installed on the system (as described at the top of this document). You will also need to add a -EGL suffix.

Example:
5.12.0-EGL

Client port: it is safe to use the default value

Server port: is is safe to use the default value

Number of nodes to reserve: enter the number of Polaris compute nodes you want to use for your job

Number of ranks per node: enter the number of ranks per node

Number of minutes to reserve: the duration of your job in minutes

Account: enter here the name of your ALCF allocation

Queue: the name of the Polaris queue you would like to use (i.e: debug for small, quick jobs, prod, preemptable)

File Systems: enter here the file systems you need for your job, separated with colons, no spaces. Keep in mind that your job may not run if one of these file systems is not available at that time, so enter these values carefully

Job name: safe to use default value. The PBS scheduler will assign this name to your job

Now you can press OK to establish the connection with a ParaView server on Polaris.

An ssh connection will be established with a Polaris login node and a password will be requested in a terminal, similar to the process you normally use to connect and work on the system.</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Quantum ESPRESSO on Polaris

Quantum ESPRESSO is an integrated suite of Open-Source computer codes for electronic-structure calculations and materials modeling at the nanoscale. It is based on density-functional theory, plane waves, and pseudopotentials.

Prebuilt executables are provided at /soft/applications/quantum_espresso.
The directory of each installation also includes a job submission script example job.sub and a README file documenting the actual build recipe.
We only support building QE using CMake.</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Datascience Anaconda Module Updates

We have updated the datascience Anaconda module and built various packages and libraries with CUDA 12.4.1 to be compatible with 
the new Polaris NVIDIA GPU hardware driver (CUDA 12.2) and to use the latest MPI, NCCL, cuDNN, TensorRT, etc. libraries. 
PyTorch 2.3.0 and TensorFlow 2.16.1 are now available as part of this module.

To use the new environment, type:
module use /soft/modulefiles 
module load conda; conda activate

/soft refresh and default $MODULEPATH change

Due to the new system software stack, /soft has been purged to allow for
software to be rebuilt. In addition, /soft/modulefiles is no longer in the
default $MODULEPATH. To access modules installed in /soft, users should run
module use /soft/modulefiles.

Adding module use /soft/modulefiles to your profile should approximate the old behavior.

Modules removed

The following modules have been removed:</DOCUMENT>

Context: <DOCUMENT>Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) mode

MIG mode can be enabled and configured on Polaris by passing a valid configuration file to qsub:

qsub ... -l mig_config=/home/ME/path/to/mig_config.json ...

You can find a concise explanation of MIG concepts and terms at https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/tesla/mig-user-guide/index.html#concepts

Configuration

Please study the following example of a valid configuration file:

shell
{
  ""group1"": {
    ""gpus"": [0,1],
    ""mig_enabled"": true,
    ""instances"": {""7g.40gb"": [""4c.7g.40gb"", ""3c.7g.40gb""] }
  },
  ""group2"": {
    ""gpus"": [2,3],
    ""mig_enabled"": true,
    ""instances"": {""3g.20gb"": [""2c.3g.20gb"", ""1c.3g.20gb""], ""2g.10gb"": [""2g.10gb""], ""1g.5gb"": [""1g.5gb""], ""1g.5gb"": [""1g.5gb""]}
  }
}

Notes

Group names are arbitrary, but must be unique

""gpus"" must be an array of integers.  if only one physical gpu is being configured in a group, it must still be contained within an array(ex. ""gpus"": [0],)

Only groups with mig_enabled set to true will be configured

instances denote the MIG gpu instances and the nested compute instances you wish to be configured

syntax is {""gpu instance 1"": [""cpu instance 1"", ""cpu instance 2""], ...}

valid gpu instances are 1g.5gb, 1g.10gb, 2g.10gb, 3g.20gb, 4g.20gb, and 7g.40gb.  the first number denotes the number of slots used out of 7 total, and the second number denotes memory in GB

the default cpu instance for any gpu instance has the same identifier as the gpu instance(in which case it will be the only one configurable)

other cpu instances can be configured with the identifier syntax Xc.Y, where X is the number of slots available in that gpu instance, and Y is the gpu instance identifier string

some gpu instances cannot be configured adjacently, despite there being sufficient slots/memory remaining(ex. 3g.20gb and 4g.20gb). Please see NVIDIA MIG documentation for further details</DOCUMENT>

Context: <DOCUMENT>JAX

JAX is another popular python package for accelerated computing.  JAX is built on XLA (the same XLA TensorFlow uses) as well as AutoGrad, and additionally has acceleration tools that operate on functions such as vmap, jit, etc.  JAX is not as widespread in machine learning as TensorFlow and PyTorch for traditional models (Computer Vision, Language Models) though it is quickly gaining promienence.  JAX is very powerful when a program needs non-traditional autodifferentiation or vectorizatoin, such as: forward-mode AD, higher order derivatives, Jacobians, Hessians, or any combination of the above.  Users of JAX on Polaris are encouraged to read the user documentation in detail, particularly the details about pure-functional programming, no in-place operations, and the common mistakes in writing functions for the @jit decorator.

JAX on Polaris

JAX is installed on Polaris via the conda module, available with:
bash
module load conda; conda activate

Then, you can load JAX in python as usual (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):

```python

import jax
jax.version
'0.3.15'

```

Notes on JAX 0.3.15

On Polaris, due to a bug, an environment variable must be set to use JAX on GPUs.  The following code will crash:
python
import jax.numpy as numpy
a = numpy.zeros(1000)
outputting an error that looks like:
python
jaxlib.xla_extension.XlaRuntimeError: UNKNOWN: no kernel image is available for execution on the device

You can fix this by setting an environment variable:
bash
export XLA_FLAGS=""--xla_gpu_force_compilation_parallelism=1""

Scaling JAX to multiple GPUs and multiple Nodes

Jax has intrinsic scaling tools to use multiple GPUs on a single node, via the pmap function.  If this is sufficient for your needs, excellent.  If not, another alternative is to use the newer package mpi4jax.</DOCUMENT>

<DOCUMENT>LLVM Compilers on Polaris

This page is not about LLVM-based Cray Compiling Environment (CCE) compilers from PrgEnv-cray but about open source LLVM compilers.

If LLVM compilers are needed without MPI support, simply load the llvm module.

Cray Programming Environment does not offer LLVM compiler support.
Thus cc/CC/ftn compiler wrappers using LLVM compilers currently are not available.
To use Clang with MPI, one can load the mpiwrappers/cray-mpich-llvm module which loads the following modules.

llvm, upstream llvm compilers

cray-mpich, MPI compiler wrappers mpicc/mpicxx/mpif90. mpif90 uses gfortran because flang is not ready for production use.

cray-pals, MPI launchers mpiexec/aprun/mpirun

Limitation There is no GPU-aware MPI library linking support by default. If needed, users should manually add the GTL (GPU Transport Layer) library to the application link line.

Update 04/25/2024 To access LLVM modules, module use /soft/modulefiles is required.

OpenMP offload

When targeting the OpenMP or CUDA programming models for GPUs, the cudatoolkit-standalone module should also be loaded.</DOCUMENT>

The smartredis and onlineGNN branches have instructions on how to build and run the examples on Polaris.

The Fall 2023 ALCF User Hands-On Workshop repository also contains information on how to use SmartSim and NekRS-ML on Polaris, but note the instructions are specfic to the Fall of 2023.

Notes</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Note: that the particles.000* is still visible.

Unhide the particles.000*data: click Eye icon

Select particles.000*data: click on name

Filters->Alphabetical->Glyph or click on the Glyph icon from the menu bar

Glyph Type: Sphere

Radius:. 0.15

Orient: Unchecked

Scale Mode: off

Set Scale Factor: 1 - Edit: Checked

Maximum Number of Points: 3000

Mask Points: Checked

Random Mode: Unchecked

Click the Apply button

Since our goal was to unclutter the display, let's hide the particles.000*by toggling them off, by clicking on the Eye icon next to it in the Pipeline Browser

Let's also switch to the Display tab in the Object Inspector, with Glyph1 selected, and change the Color by value to GlyphVector. Since the GlyphVector value is based on the velocity. We can Edit Color Map...and choose the same Blue to Red Rainbow preset that we previously chose for velocity

12. Enter: Red Blood Cells

Now let's add in both of the other data sets, which are polygonal meshes which make up Red Blood Cells (RBCs).

These two data sets are essentially the same kind of data, so we can apply the same filters and make the same types of representation changes to each of them. However, some of the RBCs are marked by the simulation that generated them as healthy (rbc.000) and some of them are marked as diseased (bad_rbc.000).

Unhide the rbc.000 and bad_rbc.000 data sets by clicking the Eye icon next to each of them to make them visible

13. Using Color to Differentiate Data

To enable us to distinguish these two types of data from one other, we can vary their representations.

One way to do this is by setting the color of the two data sets to different colors. Repeat this process for each of rbc.000 and bad_rbc.000, picking different colors.

Select one of the rbc data sets in the Pipeline Browser

Go to the Displaytab in the Object Inspector

In the Color by:dropdown select Solid Color

Click on the Set Solid Color... button

Select a color from the Select Colordialog that appears</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Set the environment variable NCCL_COLLNET_ENABLE=1

Set the environment varialbe NCCL_NET_GDR_LEVEL=PHB

Manually set the CPU affinity via mpiexec, such as with --cpu-bind verbose,list:0,8,16,24

Horovod works best when you limit the visible devices to only one GPU.  Note that if you import mpi4py or horovod, and then do something like os.environ[""CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES""] = hvd.local_rank(), it may not actually work!  You must set the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable prior to doing MPI.COMM_WORLD.init(), which is done in horovod.init() as well as implicitly in from mpi4py import MPI.   On Polaris specifically, you can use the environment variable PMI_LOCAL_RANK (as well as PMI_LOCAL_SIZE) to learn information about the node-local MPI ranks.

<DOCUMENT>Mapping Programming Models to Polaris Modules

The table below offers some suggestions for how to get started setting up your environment on Polaris depending on the programming language and model. Note, mixed C/C++ and Fortran applications should choose the programming environment for the Fortran compiler because of mpi.mod and similar incompatibilities between Fortran-generated files from different compilers. Several simple examples for testing the software environment on Polaris for different programming models are available in the ALCF GettingStart repo.

Note, users are encouraged to use PrgEnv-nvhpc instead of PrgEnv-nvidia as the latter will soon be deprecated in Cray's PE. They are otherwise identical pointing to compilers from the same NVIDIA SDK version.

- Set MPI4JAX_USE_CUDA_MPI=1 to use CUDA-Aware MPI, supported in the conda module, to do operations directly from the GPU.
- Set MPICH_GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED=1 to use CUDA-Aware MPI.

The following code, based off of a test script from the mpi4jax repository, can help you verify you are using mpi4jax properly:

```python

<DOCUMENT>NVIDIA Compilers on Polaris

The NVIDIA compilers (nvc, nvc++, nvcc, and nvfortran) are available on Polaris via the PrgEnv-nvhpc and nvhpc modules. There is currently a PrgEnv-nvidia module available, but that will soon be deprecated in Cray's PE, thus it is not recommend for use.

The Cray compiler wrappers map to NVIDIA compilers as follows.

cc -> nvc
CC -> nvc++
ftn -> nvfortran

Users are encouraged to look through NVIDIA's documentation for the NVHPC SDK and specific information on the compilers, tools, and libraries.

Notes on NVIDIA Compilers

PGI compilers

The NVIDIA programming environments makes available compilers from the NVIDIA HPC SDK. While the PGI compilers are available in this programming environment, it should be noted they are actually symlinks to the corresponding NVIDIA compilers.
pgcc -> nvc
pgc++ -> nvc++
pgf90 -> nvfortran
pgfortran -> nvfortran
While nvcc is the traditional CUDA C and CUDA C++ compiler for NVIDIA GPUs, the nvc, nvc++, and nvfortran compilers additionally target CPUs.

NVHPC SDK Directory Structure

Users migrating from CUDA toolkits to the NVHPC SDK may find it beneficial to review the directory structure of the hpc-sdk directory to find the location of commonly used libraries (including math libraries for the CPU). With the PrgEnv-nvhpc module loaded, the NVIDIA_PATH environment variable can be used to locate the path to various NVIDIA tools, libraries, and examples.

compiler/bin - cuda-gdb, ncu, nsys, ...

examples - CUDA-Fortran, OpenMP, ...

comm_libs - nccl, nvshmem, ...

<DOCUMENT>Use Reduced Precision. Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with PyTorch operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the PyTorch Automatic Mixed Precision package (AMP), as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  In PyTorch, users generally need to manage casting and loss scaling manually,  though context managers and function decorators can provide easy tools to do this.

PyTorch has a JIT module as well as backends to support op fusion, similar to TensorFlow's tf.function tools.  However, PyTorch JIT capabilities are newer and may not yield performance improvements.  Please see TorchScript for more information.

Multi-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up

PyTorch is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with PyTorch has been seen with both DDP and Horovod.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation or the Distributed Data Parallel documentation.  Some Polaris-specific details that may be helpful to you:

CPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.  In particular, we encourage users to try their scaling measurements with the following settings:

Set the environment variable NCCL_COLLNET_ENABLE=1

Set the environment varialbe NCCL_NET_GDR_LEVEL=PHB

Manually set the CPU affinity via mpiexec, such as with --cpu-bind verbose,list:0,8,16,24</DOCUMENT>

Login nodes

There are four login nodes available to users for editing code, building code, submitting / monitoring jobs, checking usage (sbank), etc..  Their full hostnames are polaris-login-N.hsn.cm.polaris.alcf.anl.gov  for N equal to 01 through 04; there are an additional two login nodes that are not user-accessible which are used for running services such as JupyterHub. The various compilers and libraries are present on the logins, so most users should be able to build their code.  However, if your build requires the physical presence of the GPU, you will need to build on a compute node.

All users share the same login nodes so please be courteous and respectful of your fellow users.  For example, please do not run computationally or IO intensive pre- or post-processing on the logins and keep the parallelism of your builds to a reasonable level.

CMake on Polaris

To use CMake on Polaris, run

module use /soft/modulefiles
module load spack-pe-base cmake</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Containers on Polaris

Polaris, powered by NVIDIA A100 GPUs, benefits from container-based workloads for seamless compatibility across NVIDIA systems. This guide details the use of containers on Polaris, including custom container creation, large-scale execution, and common pitfalls.

Apptainer Setup

Polaris employs Apptainer (formerly known as Singularity) for container management. To set up Apptainer, run:

bash
module use /soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/install/modulefiles/Core
module load apptainer
apptainer version #1.2.2

The Apptainer version on Polaris is 1.2.2. Detailed user documentation is available here

Building from Docker or Argonne GitHub Container Registry

Containers on Polaris can be built by writing Dockerfiles on a local machine and then publish the container to DockerHub, or by directly building them on ALCF compute node by writing an Apptainer recipe file. If you prefer to use existing containers, you can pull them from various registries like DockerHub and run them on Polaris.

Since Docker requires root privileges, which users do not have on Polaris, existing Docker containers must be converted to Apptainer. To build a Docker-based container on Polaris, use the following as an example:</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>In case you want write portable GPU kernels we highly recommend the KernelAbstractions.jl package. It provides a high-level abstraction for writing GPU kernels that can be compiled for different GPU backends.

julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(""KernelAbstractions"")'

By loading either oneAPI.jl, AMDGPU.jl, or CUDA.jl (see quickstart guide below).

CUDA-aware MPI

MPI.jl supports CUDA-aware MPI. This is enabled by setting the following environment variables.

bash
export JULIA_CUDA_MEMORY_POOL=none
export MPICH_GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED=1
export JULIA_MPI_PATH=${CRAY_MPICH_DIR}
export JULIA_MPI_HAS_CUDA=1

Note that MPI.jl needs to be rebuilt for the changes to take effect.

bash
julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.build(""MPI"")'

HDF5 Support

Parallel HDF5 support is provided by
module load cray-hdf5-parallel
After setting export JULIA_HDF5_PATH=$HDF5_DIR we can install the HDF5.jl package.

julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(""HDF5"")'

To remove warning messages indicating that use of JULIA_HDF5_PATH has been deprecated, one can use the following command to set the HDF5 libraries.

```
$ echo $CRAY_HDF5_PARALLEL_PREFIX/
/opt/cray/pe/hdf5-parallel/1.12.2.9/nvidia/23.3

$ julia --project -e 'using HDF5; HDF5.API.set_libraries!(""/opt/cray/pe/hdf5-parallel/1.12.2.9/nvidia/23.3/lib/libhdf5.so"", ""/opt/cray/pe/hdf5-parallel/1.12.2.9/nvidia/23.3/lib/libhdf5_hl.so"")'
```

Quickstart Guide

The following example shows how to use MPI.jl, CUDA.jl, and HDF5.jl to write a
parallel program that computes the sum of two vectors on the GPU and writes the
result to an HDF5 file. A repository with an example code computing an
approximation of pi can be found at
Polaris.jl. In this repository, you will also find
a setup_polaris.sh script that will build the HDF5.jl and MPI.jl package for the system libraries.

<DOCUMENT>Balsam

Balsam is a Python-based workflow manager that helps users execute large numbers of jobs, potentially with interjob dependencies, track job outcomes, and manage postprocessing analysis. A Balsam Site runs on a node with access to the job scheduler, where it can submit and monitor jobs. Overall job state is aggregated on the Balsam Server, making job data from all Sites accessible from any individual site (or the user's laptop), via the command-line interface or the Python API. To get information on how to use the command line tool, you can type balsam --help in your shell.

Full documentation for Balsam is available online.

Balsam requires Python 3.7+. To install Balsam on Polaris, first set up a virtual Python environment:

shell
module load conda
conda activate base
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --pre balsam

To use Balsam, users need an account on the Balsam server.  Users can get an account by contacting the ALCF Help Desk.  Once a user has an account, they can login and make a new site.  A Balsam site is a project space for your workflow. You will be prompted to select what machine (Polaris) you are working on when creating a new site:

shell
balsam login
balsam site init -n new-site new-site
cd new-site
balsam site start

   spack-pe-gnu/0.6.1

Note that spack-pe-base and spack-pe-gnu are metamodules which contain
further software offerings. See the Spack section below for details.

Spack

We have newly installed Spack deployments in /soft. Spack is an HPC-oriented
package manager which ALCF uses to install software for the user environment.
However, no knowledge of Spack is necessary to use these software offerings. All
ALCF-managed software is accessible to users via modules.

The base suite of software tools and libraries can be accessed by loading the
spack-pe-base module. This adds a path to $MODULEPATH which contains
numerous modules.

For example, to load cmake starting from the default environment, a user
should run the following commands:
module use /soft/modulefiles
module load spack-pe-base
module load cmake
Other modules in spack-pe-base can be browsed by running module avail or
module --show-hidden avail. The latter shows hidden modules which are
installed as dependencies of the un-hidden modules.

In addition to the base stack, a suite of higher-level libraries are installed
in the spack-pe-gnu module. These are built with and are dependent on
PrgEnv-gnu. A PrgEnv-nvidia-compatible stack will be available in the
future.

Note that not all software is installed through Spack; many applications and
libraries are installed as standalone packages in /soft. Users are encouraged
to browse the available modules with module avail to see what software is
installed on the system.

<DOCUMENT>Containers on Polaris

Polaris, powered by NVIDIA A100 GPUs, benefits from container-based workloads for seamless compatibility across NVIDIA systems. This guide details the use of containers on Polaris, including custom container creation, large-scale execution, and common pitfalls.

Apptainer Setup

Polaris employs Apptainer (formerly known as Singularity) for container management. To set up Apptainer, run:

bash
module use /soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/install/modulefiles/Core
module load apptainer
apptainer version #1.2.2

The Apptainer version on Polaris is 1.2.2. Detailed user documentation is available here

Building from Docker or Argonne GitHub Container Registry

Containers on Polaris can be built by writing Dockerfiles on a local machine and then publish the container to DockerHub, or by directly building them on ALCF compute node by writing an Apptainer recipe file. If you prefer to use existing containers, you can pull them from various registries like DockerHub and run them on Polaris.

Since Docker requires root privileges, which users do not have on Polaris, existing Docker containers must be converted to Apptainer. To build a Docker-based container on Polaris, use the following as an example:</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Gromacs on Polaris

What is Gromacs?

GROMACS is a versatile package to perform molecular dynamics, i.e. simulate the Newtonian equations of motion for systems with hundreds to millions of particles. It is primarily designed for biochemical molecules like proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids that have a lot of complicated bonded interactions, but since GROMACS is extremely fast at calculating the nonbonded interactions (that usually dominate simulations) many groups are also using it for research on non-biological systems, e.g. polymers.

Using GROMACS at ALCF

ALCF offers assistance with building binaries and compiling instructions for GROMACS. For questions, contact us at support@alcf.anl.gov.

The Intel oneAPI compiler and Codeplay plugins for Nvidia GPUs are available on Polaris.
The oneAPI compilers are not enabled under the Cray Programming Environment system but can be used separately.
Two oneAPI variants are provided, the first being a ""release"" version based on Intel's officially released oneAPI toolkit.
Intel Release Notes

The other variant being a build from the open-source. This variant will be more up-to-date at the risk of bugs and breakages based on code that has not undergone a full release cycle.
The documentation is located on the SYCL page. Most notable differences being, icx/icpx are the names of C/C++ compilers respectively when using the release version of the module where as clang/clang++ are for open-source variant.

Compile and Link

oneAPI uses the clang (or icx/icpx wrapper) for compiling and linking for the Nvidia A100 SM80 architecture.

When running on the login node, switch back to the default provided MPI binaries inMPI_jll.jl

GPU Support

NVIDIA GPU support is provided through the CUDA.jl package. The default in Julia is to download artifacts (e.g. CUDA toolkit) based on the runtime detected. While that should generally work, it is recommended to use the local CUDA installation provided on Polaris especially if using gpu-aware MPI in your workloads (important to use supported versions of CUDA with Cray MPICH provided).

To use the local CUDA installation provided by the modules on Polaris, the LocalPreferences.toml file can be modified as follows.

$ head $JULIA_DEPOT_PATH/environments/v1.10/LocalPreferences.toml
[CUDA_Runtime_jll]
local = true

If using the default PrgEnv-nvhpc module on Polaris, then it will be necessary to correct a path to the CUPTI library to successfully install CUDA.jl.

$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$CRAY_NVIDIA_PREFIX/cuda/12.2/extras/CUPTI/lib64/
$ julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(""CUDA"")'

The GPUs are not currently usable on the Polaris login nodes, so one can confirm the version of CUDA being used by testing in a batch or interactive job on a compute node.

Note: The cloning process can be quite slow.

Using pip install --user (not recommended)

!!! danger

With the conda environment setup, one can install common Python modules using
#!bash python3 pip install --users '<module-name>' which will install
packages in #!bash $PYTHONUSERBASE/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages.

The #!bash $PYTHONUSERBASE environment variable is automatically set when you
load the base conda module, and is equal to  #!bash
/home/$USER/.local/polaris/conda/YYYY-MM-DD.

Note, Python modules installed this way that contain command line binaries will
not have those binaries automatically added to the shell's #!bash $PATH. To
manually add the path:

bash
export PATH=""$PYTHONUSERBASE/bin:$PATH""

Be sure to remove this location from #!bash $PATH if you deactivate the base
Anaconda environment or unload the module.

Cloning the Anaconda environment, or using venv are both more flexible and
transparent when compared to #!bash --user installs.</DOCUMENT>

Context: <DOCUMENT>This variable can be used to inspect software installations and find header or
library paths. Additionally, Spack packages have a .spack directory in the
installation prefix which contains build information and logs.

Building software with Spack

Spack is a powerful package manager designed for HPC.
The Spack PE is installed and managed with Spack; users can also install Spack
in their own home or project directory to manage their software builds. Spack
has a steep learning curve, but it may benefit workflows involving frequent
builds with complex dependencies.

For users who wish to use Spack to install their own software, we provide
configuration files corresponding to the Spack PE deployments. These
configuration files can be found in config directories in /soft/spack within
the respective Spack PE installation directories. For example, the
spack-pe-base/0.6.1 configurations are in /soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/config. Not
all of these settings will be useful for all builds and it is not recommended to
adopt these wholesale as global settings. The recommended method is to include
these settings ad hoc in a spack environment to control what information spack
uses for its builds.

Note: Currently container build and executions are only supported on the Polaris compute nodes

Recipe-Based Container Building

As mentioned earlier, you can build Apptainer containers from recipe files. Instructions are available here. See available containers for more recipes.

Note: You can also build custom recipes by bootstrapping from prebuilt images. For e.g the first two lines in a recipe to use our custom Tensorflow implementation would be Bootstrap: oras followed by From: ghcr.io/argonne-lcf/tf2-mpich-nvidia-gpu:latest

Running Containers on Polaris

To run a container on Polaris you can use the submission script described here. Below is an explanation of the job submission script.

Context: <DOCUMENT>Mapping Programming Models to Polaris Modules

The table below offers some suggestions for how to get started setting up your environment on Polaris depending on the programming language and model. Note, mixed C/C++ and Fortran applications should choose the programming environment for the Fortran compiler because of mpi.mod and similar incompatibilities between Fortran-generated files from different compilers. Several simple examples for testing the software environment on Polaris for different programming models are available in the ALCF GettingStart repo.

Note, users are encouraged to use PrgEnv-nvhpc instead of PrgEnv-nvidia as the latter will soon be deprecated in Cray's PE. They are otherwise identical pointing to compilers from the same NVIDIA SDK version.

When running on the login node, switch back to the default provided MPI binaries inMPI_jll.jl

by removing theLocalPreferences.toml` file.

GPU Support

NVIDIA GPU support is provided through the CUDA.jl package. The default in Julia is to download artifacts (e.g. CUDA toolkit) based on the runtime detected. While that should generally work, it is recommended to use the local CUDA installation provided on Polaris especially if using gpu-aware MPI in your workloads (important to use supported versions of CUDA with Cray MPICH provided).

To use the local CUDA installation provided by the modules on Polaris, the LocalPreferences.toml file can be modified as follows.

$ head $JULIA_DEPOT_PATH/environments/v1.10/LocalPreferences.toml
[CUDA_Runtime_jll]
local = true

If using the default PrgEnv-nvhpc module on Polaris, then it will be necessary to correct a path to the CUPTI library to successfully install CUDA.jl.

$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$CRAY_NVIDIA_PREFIX/cuda/12.2/extras/CUPTI/lib64/
$ julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(""CUDA"")'

The GPUs are not currently usable on the Polaris login nodes, so one can confirm the version of CUDA being used by testing in a batch or interactive job on a compute node.

<DOCUMENT>Building on Polaris

The following table shows what compiler and flags to use with which PrgEnv:

module compiler flags PrgEnv-nvhpc cc/CC/ftn (nvc/nvc++/nvfortran) -mp=gpu -gpu=cc80 llvm mpicc/mpicxx (clang/clang++) -fopenmp -fopenmp-targets=nvptx64-nvidia-cuda PrgEnv-gnu cc/CC/ftn (gcc/g++/gfortran) -fopenmp PrgEnv-cray cc/CC/ftn -fopenmp

For example to compile a simple code hello.cpp:

For PrgEnv-nvhpc, after loading the modules as discussed above we would use:

CC -mp=gpu -gpu=cc80 hello.cpp
ftn -mp=gpu -gpu=cc80 hello.F90

For LLVM, after loading the modules as discussed above:

mpicxx -fopenmp -fopenmp-targets=nvptx64-nvidia-cuda hello.cpp

For PrgEnv-gnu, after loading the modules as discussed above we would use:

CC -fopenmp hello.cpp
ftn -fopenmp hello.F90

For PrgEnv-cray, after loading the modules as discussed above we would use:

CC -fopenmp hello.cpp
ftn -fopenmp hello.F90

Running on Polaris

To run, you can run the produced executable or with mpiexec in a job script, and then submit the script to the Polaris queue, like:

```
$ cat submit.sh

!/bin/sh

PBS -l select=1:system=polaris

PBS -l walltime=0:30:00

PBS -q debug

PBS -A Catalyst

PBS -l filesystems=home:eagle

cd ${PBS_O_WORKDIR}
 mpiexec -n 1 ./executable
$ # submit to the queue:
$ qsub -l select=1:system=polaris -l walltime=0:30:00 -l filesystems=home:eagle -q debug -A Catalyst ./submit.sh
```

In the above, having the PBS options in the script and on the command line is redundant, but we put it there to show both ways of launching. This submits the script to one node in the debug queue on Polaris, requesting 30 min and the eagle and home filesystems. It will charge project Catalyst for the time.

More details for setting up the job script are in Job Scheduling and Execution section.

```
$ cat hello.cpp

printf( ""Number of devices: %d\n"", omp_get_num_devices() );</DOCUMENT>

<DOCUMENT>Polaris System Updates

2024-04-22

The management software on Polaris has been upgraded to HPCM 1.10
The following version changes are in place with the upgrade to HPCM 1.10:

HPE Cray Programming Environment (CPE) 23.12

SlingShot version 2.1.2

NVIDIA SDK 23.9

NVIDIA driver version 535.154.05

CUDA 12.2

SUSE 15 SP5

Releasing jobs

Jobs that were queued before the upgrade have been restored to the appropriate queues but are placed on user hold. 
Jobs are not expected to complete successfully due to the changes made to the system and software environments resulting from the upgrade. 
We recommend you review your jobs and either release the hold (qrls <jobid>) or delete it (qdel <jobid>) and resubmit as appropriate.

Users need to rebuild for the new PE environment and major OS upgrade. Existing binaries are unlikely to run successfully.

We have held all jobs submitted prior to the upgrade as a user hold. Users may release their existing jobs with qrls to run after they have rebuilt their binaries.

PBS does cache the job execution script.  If a change to the script is required due to a path changing post rebuild, the job will have to be resubmitted.

All application binaries should be rebuilt prior to further job submissions.

Re-building user codes

Many user codes will need to be re-built and/or re-linked against the newer version of the programming environment (23.12) and Spack provided dependencies.

Changes to the user software environment

In addition to the system upgrades, several changes have been made to the user
software environment which may impact user workflows.

Older PE versions removed

Older versions of the Cray PE (older than 23.12) are deprecated as they are incompatible with the
upgraded system stack and are no longer available for use.

Context: <DOCUMENT>Use TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.  Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.  When possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention.

Use XLA compilation on your code.  XLA is the Accelerated Linear Algebra library that is available in tensorFlow and critical in software like JAX.  XLA will compile a tf.Graph object, generated with tf.function or similar, and perform optimizations like operation-fusion.  XLA can give impressive performance boosts with almost no user changes except to set an environment variable TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2.  If your code is complex, or has dynamically sized tensors (tensors where the shape changes every iteration), XLA can be detrimental: the overhead for compiling functions can be large enough to mitigate performance improvements.  XLA is particularly powerful when combined with reduced precision, yielding speedups > 100% in some models.

Multi-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up

TensorFlow is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with tensorFlow has been seen with horovod in particular.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation.  Some polaris specific details that may be helpful to you:

CPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.  In particular, we encourage users to try their scaling measurements with the following settings:

<DOCUMENT>Spack PE

Spack is an HPC-oriented package manager which ALCF uses to install software for
the user environment.

ALCF's Spack PE is a Spack-managed software stack which provides various build
tools, utilities, and libraries. It consists of a base stack (spack-pe-base)
and PrgEnv-dependent stacks (currently spack-pe-gnu).

spack-pe-base contains commonplace software compiled for CPU with the system
GCC compilers. Accordingly, the software in spack-pe-base can be used
regardless of programming environment.

spack-pe-gnu is based on the E4S Project and
provides performant HPC libraries built with PrgEnv-gnu and the nvcc CUDA
compiler driver for GPU code. spack-pe-gnu is dependent on both
spack-pe-base and PrgEnv-gnu.

Using software from the Spack PE

The base suite of software tools and libraries can be accessed by loading the
spack-pe-base module. This adds a path to $MODULEPATH which contains
numerous modules.

For example, to load cmake starting from the default environment, a user
should run the following commands:
module use /soft/modulefiles
module load spack-pe-base
module load cmake

The spack-pe-base module adds paths to the user's MODULEPATH; individual packages are subsequently loaded through the newly available modules. The full list of available packages can be viewed by running module avail or module --show-hidden avail for a complete listing. Packages are loaded in the same way from spack-pe-gnu.

Inspecting packages

When a module in the Spack PE is loaded, several environment variables are
updated to integrate the package into the user's environment. Additionally, the
PACKAGE_ROOT variable is set to the path to the installation prefix of the
package. For example, after loading cmake as above:

$ echo $CMAKE_ROOT
/soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/install/linux-sles15-x86_64/gcc-12.3.0/cmake-3.27.7-a435jtzvweeos2es6enirbxdjdqhqgdp/

Context: <DOCUMENT>This variable can be used to inspect software installations and find header or
library paths. Additionally, Spack packages have a .spack directory in the
installation prefix which contains build information and logs.

Building software with Spack

Spack is a powerful package manager designed for HPC.
The Spack PE is installed and managed with Spack; users can also install Spack
in their own home or project directory to manage their software builds. Spack
has a steep learning curve, but it may benefit workflows involving frequent
builds with complex dependencies.

For users who wish to use Spack to install their own software, we provide
configuration files corresponding to the Spack PE deployments. These
configuration files can be found in config directories in /soft/spack within
the respective Spack PE installation directories. For example, the
spack-pe-base/0.6.1 configurations are in /soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/config. Not
all of these settings will be useful for all builds and it is not recommended to
adopt these wholesale as global settings. The recommended method is to include
these settings ad hoc in a spack environment to control what information spack
uses for its builds.

Support requests and feedback should be directed to
support@alcf.anl.gov. For general Spack
questions, users are encouraged to consult the following resources:

Queues

There are five production queues you can target in your qsub (-q <queue name>):

Queue Name Node Min Node Max Time Min Time Max Notes debug 1 2 5 min 1 hr max 24 nodes in use by this queue ay any given time; Only 8 nodes are exclusive (see Note below) debug-scaling 1 10 5 min 1 hr max 1 job running/accruing/queued per-user prod 10 496 5 min 24 hrs Routing queue; See below preemptable 1 10 5 min 72 hrs Please be aware that jobs in the preemptable queue can be killed at any time if jobs are submitted to the demand queue. Max 20 jobs running/accruing/queued per-project ; see Note below demand 1 56 5 min 1 hr By request only ; max 100 jobs running/accruing/queued per-project

Note: Please be aware that jobs in the preemptable queue can be killed at any time if jobs are submitted to the demand queue.
Jobs in the demand queue take priority over jobs in the preemptable queue.
This means jobs in the preemptable queue may be preempted (killed without any warning) if there are jobs in the demand queue.
Unfortunately, there's always an inherent risk of jobs being killed when using the preemptable queue. 
Please use the following command to view details of a queue: qstat -Qf <queuename>

To make your job re-runable add the following PBS directive: #PBS -r y This will ensure your job will restart once the demand job is complete.

Note: The debug queue has 8 exclusively dedicated nodes.
If there are free nodes in production, then debug jobs can take another 16 nodes for a total of 24.

prod is routing queue and routes your job to one of the following six execution queues:

<DOCUMENT>Balsam

Balsam is a Python-based workflow manager that helps users execute large numbers of jobs, potentially with interjob dependencies, track job outcomes, and manage postprocessing analysis. A Balsam Site runs on a node with access to the job scheduler, where it can submit and monitor jobs. Overall job state is aggregated on the Balsam Server, making job data from all Sites accessible from any individual site (or the user's laptop), via the command-line interface or the Python API. To get information on how to use the command line tool, you can type balsam --help in your shell.

Full documentation for Balsam is available online.

Balsam requires Python 3.7+. To install Balsam on Polaris, first set up a virtual Python environment:

shell
module load conda
conda activate base
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --pre balsam

To use Balsam, users need an account on the Balsam server.  Users can get an account by contacting the ALCF Help Desk.  Once a user has an account, they can login and make a new site.  A Balsam site is a project space for your workflow. You will be prompted to select what machine (Polaris) you are working on when creating a new site:

shell
balsam login
balsam site init -n new-site new-site
cd new-site
balsam site start

See the Balsam documentation for full details.</DOCUMENT>

6. Streamlines as Tubes

The streamlines are just that, lines. We can use the Tubes filter to represent them as 3D objects, rather than just lines.
- With StreamTracer1selected in the Pipeline Browser, from the main menu select: Filters->Alphabetical->Tube
- In the Object Inspector make sure the Properties tab is selected
- The default value for the Radius is a bit too large for this data, let's set that value to 0
- Click the Apply button
- Notice that the StreamLine1 object has automatically been hidden
- There are many different ways to color these tubes
- With Tubes1 selected, switch to the Display tab in the Object Inspector
- The Color bydropdown lets you choose from a handful of different variables

7. Cutting Planes (Slices)

Now let's add some cutting plans, or slices, to see what the cross-section of the continuum data looks like.
- Again, be sure that the continuum.000*data is selected in the Pipeline Browser
- Filters->Alphabetical->Slice or Click on the Slice icon from the menu bar
- In the Object Inspector make sure the Propertiestab is selected
- At the bottom on the Object Inspector is a section titled Slice Offset Values. Here we can generate values for multiple slices to be made
- First click the Delete All button to remove initial values
- Next, click the New Range button. This will bring up an Add Range dialog box.
- Set the number of Steps to 7. Click OK

Context: <DOCUMENT>ParaView on Polaris

The recommended way of running ParaView on Polaris is in client/server mode. This consists of running the ParaView client on your local resource, and the ParaView server on the Polaris compute nodes. The ParaView client needs to first be installed on your local resource, and needs to match the version that you run on Polaris.

There are multiple versions of ParaView installed on Polaris. To find the versions of ParaView currently available on Polaris run the following command on a login node: 
module use /soft/modulefiles
module avail paraview

Binary and source packages of the ParaView client for Linux, MacOS, and Windows are available from the ParaView Download Page.

Connecting to the ParaView server on Polaris

This section describes how to launch the ParaView server on Polaris from a local ParaView client.

Start ParaView Client

First, launch the ParaView client on your local resource. You will need to configure some server settings in the client. This initial set up should only need to be done once, and can be reused each time you want to run ParaView on Polaris.

Server Configuration

1. Select Connect

From the ParaView client choose to connect to a server by either clicking on the ""Connect"" icon in the menu bar

or selecting File->Connect from the main menu

2. Set Up Servers (first time only)

The first time you want to run a server on Polaris and have it connect to your local ParaView client, you will need to set up a Server. Once this server is set up, you can reuse it each time you run the ParaView client with the ParaView server on Polaris.

Kitware, the developers of ParaView, maintain a database of server configurations which you can retrieve through the ParaView client. In the File->Connect menu press the button named ""Fetch Servers"" and select POLARIS@ANL. Windows users should select ""windows to POLARIS@ANL"". Press ""Import Selected""

3. Use ParaView</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>OpenMM on Polaris

What is OpenMM?

OpenMM is a high-performance toolkit for molecular simulations that can be used as a stand-alone application or as a library. It provides a combination of flexibility (through custom forces and integrators), openness, and high-performance (especially on recent GPUs).

Using OpenMM at ALCF

ALCF offers assistance with building binaries and compiling instructions for OpenMM. For questions, contact us at support@alcf.anl.gov.

Building OpenMM using Conda module

<DOCUMENT>Building on Polaris

The following table shows what compiler and flags to use with which PrgEnv:

module compiler flags PrgEnv-nvhpc cc/CC/ftn (nvc/nvc++/nvfortran) -mp=gpu -gpu=cc80 llvm mpicc/mpicxx (clang/clang++) -fopenmp -fopenmp-targets=nvptx64-nvidia-cuda PrgEnv-gnu cc/CC/ftn (gcc/g++/gfortran) -fopenmp PrgEnv-cray cc/CC/ftn -fopenmp

For example to compile a simple code hello.cpp:

For PrgEnv-nvhpc, after loading the modules as discussed above we would use:

CC -mp=gpu -gpu=cc80 hello.cpp
ftn -mp=gpu -gpu=cc80 hello.F90

For LLVM, after loading the modules as discussed above:

mpicxx -fopenmp -fopenmp-targets=nvptx64-nvidia-cuda hello.cpp

For PrgEnv-gnu, after loading the modules as discussed above we would use:

CC -fopenmp hello.cpp
ftn -fopenmp hello.F90

For PrgEnv-cray, after loading the modules as discussed above we would use:

CC -fopenmp hello.cpp
ftn -fopenmp hello.F90

Running on Polaris

To run, you can run the produced executable or with mpiexec in a job script, and then submit the script to the Polaris queue, like:

```
$ cat submit.sh

!/bin/sh

PBS -l select=1:system=polaris

PBS -l walltime=0:30:00

PBS -q debug

PBS -A Catalyst

PBS -l filesystems=home:eagle

cd ${PBS_O_WORKDIR}
 mpiexec -n 1 ./executable
$ # submit to the queue:
$ qsub -l select=1:system=polaris -l walltime=0:30:00 -l filesystems=home:eagle -q debug -A Catalyst ./submit.sh
```

In the above, having the PBS options in the script and on the command line is redundant, but we put it there to show both ways of launching. This submits the script to one node in the debug queue on Polaris, requesting 30 min and the eagle and home filesystems. It will charge project Catalyst for the time.

More details for setting up the job script are in Job Scheduling and Execution section.

Example

```
$ cat hello.cpp

include

include

int main( int argv, char** argc ) {

printf( ""Number of devices: %d\n"", omp_get_num_devices() );</DOCUMENT>

Context: <DOCUMENT>In case you want write portable GPU kernels we highly recommend the KernelAbstractions.jl package. It provides a high-level abstraction for writing GPU kernels that can be compiled for different GPU backends.

julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(""KernelAbstractions"")'

By loading either oneAPI.jl, AMDGPU.jl, or CUDA.jl (see quickstart guide below).

CUDA-aware MPI

MPI.jl supports CUDA-aware MPI. This is enabled by setting the following environment variables.

bash
export JULIA_CUDA_MEMORY_POOL=none
export MPICH_GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED=1
export JULIA_MPI_PATH=${CRAY_MPICH_DIR}
export JULIA_MPI_HAS_CUDA=1

Note that MPI.jl needs to be rebuilt for the changes to take effect.

bash
julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.build(""MPI"")'

HDF5 Support

Parallel HDF5 support is provided by
module load cray-hdf5-parallel
After setting export JULIA_HDF5_PATH=$HDF5_DIR we can install the HDF5.jl package.

julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(""HDF5"")'

To remove warning messages indicating that use of JULIA_HDF5_PATH has been deprecated, one can use the following command to set the HDF5 libraries.

```
$ echo $CRAY_HDF5_PARALLEL_PREFIX/
/opt/cray/pe/hdf5-parallel/1.12.2.9/nvidia/23.3

$ julia --project -e 'using HDF5; HDF5.API.set_libraries!(""/opt/cray/pe/hdf5-parallel/1.12.2.9/nvidia/23.3/lib/libhdf5.so"", ""/opt/cray/pe/hdf5-parallel/1.12.2.9/nvidia/23.3/lib/libhdf5_hl.so"")'
```

Quickstart Guide

The following example shows how to use MPI.jl, CUDA.jl, and HDF5.jl to write a
parallel program that computes the sum of two vectors on the GPU and writes the
result to an HDF5 file. A repository with an example code computing an
approximation of pi can be found at
Polaris.jl. In this repository, you will also find
a setup_polaris.sh script that will build the HDF5.jl and MPI.jl package for the system libraries.
The dependencies are installed with the following commands:

<DOCUMENT>Gateway nodes

There are 50 gateway nodes.  These nodes are not user accessible, but are used transparently for access to the storage systems.  Each node has a single 200 Gbps HDR IB card for access to the storage area network.  This gives a theoretical peak bandwidth of 1250 GB/s which is approximately the aggregate bandwidth of the global file systems (1300 GB/s).

Storage

Polaris has access to the ALCF global file systems.  Details on storage can be found here.</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>JAX

JAX is another popular python package for accelerated computing.  JAX is built on XLA (the same XLA TensorFlow uses) as well as AutoGrad, and additionally has acceleration tools that operate on functions such as vmap, jit, etc.  JAX is not as widespread in machine learning as TensorFlow and PyTorch for traditional models (Computer Vision, Language Models) though it is quickly gaining promienence.  JAX is very powerful when a program needs non-traditional autodifferentiation or vectorizatoin, such as: forward-mode AD, higher order derivatives, Jacobians, Hessians, or any combination of the above.  Users of JAX on Polaris are encouraged to read the user documentation in detail, particularly the details about pure-functional programming, no in-place operations, and the common mistakes in writing functions for the @jit decorator.

JAX on Polaris

JAX is installed on Polaris via the conda module, available with:
bash
module load conda; conda activate

Then, you can load JAX in python as usual (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):

```python

import jax
jax.version
'0.3.15'

```

Notes on JAX 0.3.15

On Polaris, due to a bug, an environment variable must be set to use JAX on GPUs.  The following code will crash:
python
import jax.numpy as numpy
a = numpy.zeros(1000)
outputting an error that looks like:
python
jaxlib.xla_extension.XlaRuntimeError: UNKNOWN: no kernel image is available for execution on the device

You can fix this by setting an environment variable:
bash
export XLA_FLAGS=""--xla_gpu_force_compilation_parallelism=1""

Scaling JAX to multiple GPUs and multiple Nodes

Jax has intrinsic scaling tools to use multiple GPUs on a single node, via the pmap function.  If this is sufficient for your needs, excellent.  If not, another alternative is to use the newer package mpi4jax.</DOCUMENT>

Context: <DOCUMENT>Use Reduced Precision. Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with PyTorch operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the PyTorch Automatic Mixed Precision package (AMP), as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  In PyTorch, users generally need to manage casting and loss scaling manually,  though context managers and function decorators can provide easy tools to do this.

PyTorch has a JIT module as well as backends to support op fusion, similar to TensorFlow's tf.function tools.  However, PyTorch JIT capabilities are newer and may not yield performance improvements.  Please see TorchScript for more information.

Multi-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up

PyTorch is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with PyTorch has been seen with both DDP and Horovod.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation or the Distributed Data Parallel documentation.  Some Polaris-specific details that may be helpful to you:

CPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.  In particular, we encourage users to try their scaling measurements with the following settings:

Set the environment variable NCCL_COLLNET_ENABLE=1

Set the environment varialbe NCCL_NET_GDR_LEVEL=PHB

Manually set the CPU affinity via mpiexec, such as with --cpu-bind verbose,list:0,8,16,24</DOCUMENT>

<DOCUMENT>SmartSim and SmartRedis

SmartSim is an open source tool developed by the Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) designed to facilitate the integration of traditional HPC simulation applications with machine learning workflows.
There are two core components to SmartSim:

Infrastructure library (IL)
Provides API to start, stop and monitor HPC applications from Python
Interfaces with the scheduler launch jobs (PBSPro on Polaris and Cobalt on Theta/ThetaGPU)
Deploys a distributed in-memory database called the Orchestrator

SmartRedis client library
Provides clients that connect to the Orchestrator from Fortran, C, C++, Python code
The client API library enables data transfer to/from database and ability to load and run JIT-traced Python and ML runtimes acting on stored data

For more resources on SmartSim, follow the links below:

<DOCUMENT>Notes

SmartSim workflows, such as online training, often require launching multiple MPI applications on the same set of nodes. On Polaris, the MPICH_OFI_CXI_PID_BASE=0 must be exported before the first call to mpiexec, and then incremented by 1 and re-exported before each successive call. This is done with the SmartSim API by adding env_vars={'MPICH_OFI_CXI_PID_BASE':str(0)} to the PalsMpiexecSettings() API.</DOCUMENT>

Context: <DOCUMENT>Example Programs and Makefiles for Polaris

Several simple examples of building CPU and GPU-enabled codes on Polaris are available in the ALCF GettingStart repo for several programming models. If build your application is problematic for some reason (e.g. absence of a GPU), then users are encouraged to build and test applications directly on one of the Polaris compute nodes via an interactive job. The discussion below makes use of the NVHPC compilers in the default environment as illustrative examples. Similar examples for other compilers on Polaris are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo.

CPU MPI+OpenMP Example

One of the first useful tasks with any new machine, scheduler, and job launcher is to ensure one is binding MPI ranks and OpenMP threads to the host cpu as intended. A simple HelloWorld MPI+OpenMP example is available here to get started with.

The application can be straightforwardly compiled using the Cray compiler wrappers.
CC -fopenmp main.cpp -o hello_affinity

The executable hello_affinity can then be launched in a job script (or directly in shell of interactive job) using mpiexec as discussed here.

```

mpiexec -n ${NTOTRANKS} --ppn ${NRANKS_PER_NODE} --depth=${NDEPTH} --cpu-bind depth ./hello_affinity
```

CUDA

Several variants of C/C++ and Fortran CUDA examples are available here that include MPI and multi-gpu examples.

One can use the Cray compiler wrappers to compile GPU-enabled applications as well. This example of simple vector addition uses the NVIDIA compilers.

Queues

There are five production queues you can target in your qsub (-q <queue name>):

Queue Name Node Min Node Max Time Min Time Max Notes debug 1 2 5 min 1 hr max 24 nodes in use by this queue ay any given time; Only 8 nodes are exclusive (see Note below) debug-scaling 1 10 5 min 1 hr max 1 job running/accruing/queued per-user prod 10 496 5 min 24 hrs Routing queue; See below preemptable 1 10 5 min 72 hrs Please be aware that jobs in the preemptable queue can be killed at any time if jobs are submitted to the demand queue. Max 20 jobs running/accruing/queued per-project ; see Note below demand 1 56 5 min 1 hr By request only ; max 100 jobs running/accruing/queued per-project

Note: Please be aware that jobs in the preemptable queue can be killed at any time if jobs are submitted to the demand queue.
Jobs in the demand queue take priority over jobs in the preemptable queue.
This means jobs in the preemptable queue may be preempted (killed without any warning) if there are jobs in the demand queue.
Unfortunately, there's always an inherent risk of jobs being killed when using the preemptable queue. 
Please use the following command to view details of a queue: qstat -Qf <queuename>

To make your job re-runable add the following PBS directive: #PBS -r y This will ensure your job will restart once the demand job is complete.

Note: The debug queue has 8 exclusively dedicated nodes.
If there are free nodes in production, then debug jobs can take another 16 nodes for a total of 24.

prod is routing queue and routes your job to one of the following six execution queues:

<DOCUMENT>GNU Compilers on Polaris

The GNU compilers are available on Polaris via the PrgEnv-gnu and gcc-mixed modules. The gcc-mixed module can be useful when, for example, the PrgEnv-nvhpc compilers are used to compile C/C++ MPI-enabled code and gfortran is needed.

The GNU compilers currently on Polaris do not support GPU code generation and thus can only be used for compiling CPU codes.

The nvhpc and llvm compilers can be used for compiling GPU-enabled applications.</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>mpi4Jax is a relatively new project and requires setting some environment variables for good performance and usability:
- Set MPI4JAX_USE_CUDA_MPI=1 to use CUDA-Aware MPI, supported in the conda module, to do operations directly from the GPU.
- Set MPICH_GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED=1 to use CUDA-Aware MPI.

The following code, based off of a test script from the mpi4jax repository, can help you verify you are using mpi4jax properly:

```python
import os
from mpi4py import MPI
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
import mpi4jax

comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD
rank = comm.Get_rank()
local_rank = int(os.environ[""PMI_LOCAL_RANK""])

available_devices = jax.devices(""gpu"")
if len(available_devices) <= local_rank:
    raise Exception(""Could not find enough GPUs"")

target_device = available_devices[local_rank]

@jax.jit
def foo(arr):
   arr = arr + rank
   arr_sum, _ = mpi4jax.allreduce(arr, op=MPI.SUM, comm=comm)
   return arr_sum

with jax.default_device(target_device):
    a = jnp.zeros((3, 3))
    print(f""Rank {rank}, local rank {local_rank}, a.device is {a.device()}"")
    result = foo(a)
    print(f""Rank {rank}, local rank {local_rank}, result.device is {result.device()}"")

if rank == 0:
   print(result)

```

JAX and mpi4jax are both still somewhat early in their software lifecycles.  Updates are frequent, and if you require assistance please contact support@alcf.anl.gov.</DOCUMENT>

cabana/dev-9a1ad605/kokv/4.2.01/PrgEnv-gnu/8.5.0/gnu/12.3/cuda_cudatoolkit_12.2.91
   cuda-PrgEnv-nvidia/12.2.91
   cudatoolkit-standalone/12.2.2                                                      (D)

   spack-pe-base/0.6.1
   spack-pe-gnu/0.6.1

Note that spack-pe-base and spack-pe-gnu are metamodules which contain
further software offerings. See the Spack section below for details.

Spack

We have newly installed Spack deployments in /soft. Spack is an HPC-oriented
package manager which ALCF uses to install software for the user environment.
However, no knowledge of Spack is necessary to use these software offerings. All
ALCF-managed software is accessible to users via modules.

The base suite of software tools and libraries can be accessed by loading the
spack-pe-base module. This adds a path to $MODULEPATH which contains
numerous modules.

For example, to load cmake starting from the default environment, a user
should run the following commands:
module use /soft/modulefiles
module load spack-pe-base
module load cmake
Other modules in spack-pe-base can be browsed by running module avail or
module --show-hidden avail. The latter shows hidden modules which are
installed as dependencies of the un-hidden modules.

In addition to the base stack, a suite of higher-level libraries are installed
in the spack-pe-gnu module. These are built with and are dependent on
PrgEnv-gnu. A PrgEnv-nvidia-compatible stack will be available in the
future.

Note that not all software is installed through Spack; many applications and
libraries are installed as standalone packages in /soft. Users are encouraged
to browse the available modules with module avail to see what software is
installed on the system.

NVIDIA CUDA-GDB Documentation

Introduction

CUDA-GDB is the NVIDIA tool for debugging CUDA applications running on Polaris. CUDA-GDB is an extension to GDB, the GNU Project debugger. The tool provides developers with a mechanism for debugging CUDA applications running on actual hardware. This enables developers to debug applications without the potential variations introduced by simulation and emulation environments.

Step-by-step guide

Debug Compilation

NVCC, the NVIDIA CUDA compiler driver, provides a mechanism for generating the debugging information necessary for CUDA-GDB to work properly. The -g -G option pair must be passed to NVCC when an application is compiled for ease of debugging with CUDA-GDB; for example,
nvcc -g -G foo.cu -o foo
Using this line to compile the CUDA application foo.cu
* forces -O0 compilation, with the exception of very limited dead-code eliminations and register-spilling optimizations.
* makes the compiler include debug information in the executable

Running CUDA-gdb on Polaris compute nodes

Start an interactive job mode on Polaris as follows:

```
$ qsub -I -l select=1 -l walltime=1:00:00

$ cuda-gdb --version

Large-scale parallelism

CUDA.jl uses the nvcc compiler to compile GPU kernels. This will create object files in the TEMP filesystem. The default TMPDIR in a job on Polaris is set to a temp directory that only exists on the head node of a job. We recommend setting TEMPDIR to a local directory on each compute node.

<DOCUMENT>OpenMM on Polaris

What is OpenMM?

OpenMM is a high-performance toolkit for molecular simulations that can be used as a stand-alone application or as a library. It provides a combination of flexibility (through custom forces and integrators), openness, and high-performance (especially on recent GPUs).

Using OpenMM at ALCF

ALCF offers assistance with building binaries and compiling instructions for OpenMM. For questions, contact us at support@alcf.anl.gov.

GPU package

The module environments above can be used to build LAMMPS with the GPU package as well. Copies of Makefiles for building with the GPU package using CUDA for GPU support with the GNU and NVHPC compilers are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo here.

Performance Notes

Some useful information on accelerator packages and expectations can be found on the LAMMPS website here.</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>JAX

JAX is another popular python package for accelerated computing.  JAX is built on XLA (the same XLA TensorFlow uses) as well as AutoGrad, and additionally has acceleration tools that operate on functions such as vmap, jit, etc.  JAX is not as widespread in machine learning as TensorFlow and PyTorch for traditional models (Computer Vision, Language Models) though it is quickly gaining promienence.  JAX is very powerful when a program needs non-traditional autodifferentiation or vectorizatoin, such as: forward-mode AD, higher order derivatives, Jacobians, Hessians, or any combination of the above.  Users of JAX on Polaris are encouraged to read the user documentation in detail, particularly the details about pure-functional programming, no in-place operations, and the common mistakes in writing functions for the @jit decorator.

JAX on Polaris

JAX is installed on Polaris via the conda module, available with:
bash
module load conda; conda activate

Then, you can load JAX in python as usual (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):

```python

import jax
jax.version
'0.3.15'

```

Notes on JAX 0.3.15

On Polaris, due to a bug, an environment variable must be set to use JAX on GPUs.  The following code will crash:
python
import jax.numpy as numpy
a = numpy.zeros(1000)
outputting an error that looks like:
python
jaxlib.xla_extension.XlaRuntimeError: UNKNOWN: no kernel image is available for execution on the device

You can fix this by setting an environment variable:
bash
export XLA_FLAGS=""--xla_gpu_force_compilation_parallelism=1""

Scaling JAX to multiple GPUs and multiple Nodes

Jax has intrinsic scaling tools to use multiple GPUs on a single node, via the pmap function.  If this is sufficient for your needs, excellent.  If not, another alternative is to use the newer package mpi4jax.</DOCUMENT>

Context: <DOCUMENT>Running Multiple MPI Applications on a node

Multiple applications can be run simultaneously on a node by launching several mpiexec commands and backgrounding them. For performance, it will likely be necessary to ensure that each application runs on a distinct set of CPU resources and/or targets specific GPUs. One can provide a list of CPUs using the --cpu-bind option, which when combined with CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES provides a user with specifying exactly which CPU and GPU resources to run each application on. In the example below, four instances of the application are simultaneously running on a single node. In the first instance, the application is spawning MPI ranks 0-7 on CPUs 24-31 and using GPU 0. This mapping is based on output from the nvidia-smi topo -m command and pairs CPUs with the closest GPU.

```bash
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
mpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:24:25:26:27:28:29:30:31 ./hello_affinity &

export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1
mpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:16:17:18:19:20:21:22:23 ./hello_affinity &

Compute Node Access to the Internet

Currently, the only access the internet is via a proxy.  Here are the proxy environment variables for Polaris:

bash
export http_proxy=""http://proxy.alcf.anl.gov:3128""
export https_proxy=""http://proxy.alcf.anl.gov:3128""
export ftp_proxy=""http://proxy.alcf.anl.gov:3128""

In the future, though we don't have a timeline on this because it depends on future features in slingshot and internal software development, we intend to have public IP addresses be a schedulable resource.  For instance, if only your head node needed public access your select statement might looks something like: -l select=1:pubnet=True+63.

Controlling Where Your Job Runs</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Currently, MIG configuration is only available in the debug, debug-scaling, and preemptable queues.  submissions to other queues will result in any MIG config files passed being silently ignored

Files which do not match the above syntax will be silently rejected, and any invalid configurations in properly formatted files will be silently ignored. Please test any changes to your configuration in an interactive job session before use

A basic validator script is available at /soft/pbs/mig_conf_validate.sh. It will check for simple errors in your config, and print the expected configuration. For example:

```shell
ascovel@polaris-login-02:~> /soft/pbs/mig_conf_validate.sh -h
usage: mig_conf_validate.sh -c CONFIG_FILE
ascovel@polaris-login-02:~> /soft/pbs/mig_conf_validate.sh -c ./polaris-mig/mig_config.json

Setting up compiler and libraries with module

The follow modules will update the include and libraries paths used by the Cray compiler wrapper ftn to load additional math libraries for the CPU.</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>PyTorch on Polaris

PyTorch is a popular, open source deep learning framework developed and released by Facebook.  The PyTorch home page has more information about PyTorch, which you can refer to.  For trouble shooting on Polaris, please contact support@alcf.anl.gov.

Installation on Polaris

PyTorch is installed on Polaris already, available in the conda module.  To use it from a compute node, please do:

bash
module load conda
conda activate

Then, you can load PyTorch in python as usual (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):

```python

import torch
torch.version
'1.12.0a0+git67ece03'

```

This installation of PyTorch was built from source and the cuda libraries it uses are found via the CUDA_HOME environment variable (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):

bash
$ echo $CUDA_HOME
/soft/datascience/cuda/cuda_11.5.2_495.29.05_linux

If you need to build applications that use this version of PyTorch and CUDA, we recommend using these cuda libraries to ensure compatibility.  We periodically update the PyTorch release, though updates will come in the form of new versions of the conda module.

PyTorch is also available through nvidia containers that have been translated to Singularity containers.  For more information about containers, please see the containers documentation page.

PyTorch Best Practices on Polaris

Single Node Performance

When running PyTorch applications, we have found the following practices to be generally, if not universally, useful and encourage you to try some of these techniques to boost performance of your own applications.</DOCUMENT>

User: Can you explain the significance of using `nvc++ --no_warnings` in the CXX_PARS variable?
Assistant: The significance of using `nvc++ --no_warnings` in CXX_PARS is that it suppresses warning messages while compiling, making it easier to focus on actual errors or issues.

Compiling VASP

Once the modules are loaded and a makefile.include is in the vasp folder, compiling all the object files and binaries is done with:

make -j1

Running VASP in Polaris

```

Running GPU-enabled Applications

GPU-enabled applications will similarly run on the compute nodes using the above example script.
- The environment variable MPICH_GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED=1 needs to be set if your application requires MPI-GPU support whereby the MPI library sends and receives data directly from GPU buffers. In this case, it will be important to have the craype-accel-nvidia80 module loaded both when compiling your application and during runtime to correctly link against a GPU Transport Layer (GTL) MPI library. Otherwise, you'll likely see GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED is requested, but GTL library is not linked errors during runtime.
- If running on a specific GPU or subset of GPUs is desired, then the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable can be used. For example, if one only wanted an application to access the first two GPUs on a node, then setting CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 could be used.

Binding MPI ranks to GPUs

The Cray MPI on Polaris does not currently support binding MPI ranks to GPUs. For applications that need this support, this instead can be handled by use of a small helper script that will appropriately set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES for each MPI rank. One example is available here where each MPI rank is similarly bound to a single GPU with round-robin assignment.

A example set_affinity_gpu_polaris.sh script follows where GPUs are assigned round-robin to MPI ranks.

```bash

!/bin/bash -l

num_gpus=4

need to assign GPUs in reverse order due to topology

<DOCUMENT>Parsl on Polaris

Parsl is a flexible and scalable parallel programming library for Python.

-- Parsl Documentation

For many applications, managing an ensemble of jobs into a workflow is a critical step that can easily become a performance bottleneck.  Many tools exist to address this, of which parsl is just one.  On this page, we'll highlight some of the key pieces of information about parsl that are relevant to Polaris.  Parsl is also extensively documented, has a dedicated Slack Channel, and a large community of users and developers beyond ALCF.  We encourage you to engage with the parsl community for support with parsl specific questions, and for Polaris-specific questions or problems, please contact support@alcf.anl.gov.

Getting Parsl on Polaris

You can install parsl building off of the conda modules.  You have some flexibility in how you want to extend the conda module to include parsl, but here is an example way to do it:

```python

Load the Conda Module (needed everytime you use parsl)

module load conda
conda activate

Create a virtual env that uses the conda env as the system packages.

Only do the next line on initial set up:

python -m venv --system-site-packages /path/to/your/virtualenv

Load the virtual env (every time):

source /path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/activate

Install parsl (only once)

pip install parsl

```

Using Parsl on Polaris

Parsl has a variety of possible configuration settings.  As an example, we provide the configuration below that will run one task per GPU:

```python
from parsl.config import Config

PBSPro is the right provider for Polaris:

from parsl.providers import PBSProProvider

The high throughput executor is for scaling to HPC systems:

from parsl.executors import HighThroughputExecutor

You can use the MPI launcher, but may want the Gnu Parallel launcher, see below

from parsl.launchers import MpiExecLauncher, GnuParallelLauncher

address_by_interface is needed for the HighThroughputExecutor:</DOCUMENT>

oneAPI Math Kernel Library (oneMKL) Interfaces

oneMKL Interfaces is an open-source implementation of the oneMKL Data Parallel C++ (DPC++) interface according to the oneMKL specification. It works with multiple devices (backends) using device-specific libraries underneath.

oneMKL is part of oneAPI. Various backend supported are shown below. More Information here.

Horovod and DDP work best when you limit the visible devices to only one GPU.  Note that if you import mpi4py or horovod, and then do something like os.environ[""CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES""] = hvd.local_rank(), it may not actually work!  You must set the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable prior to doing MPI.COMM_WORLD.init(), which is done in horovod.init() as well as implicitly in from mpi4py import MPI.   On Polaris specifically, you can use the environment variable PMI_LOCAL_RANK (as well as PMI_LOCAL_SIZE) to learn information about the node-local MPI ranks.

DeepSpeed

DeepSpeed is also available and usable on Polaris.  For more information, please see the DeepSpeed documentation directly.

PyTorch DataLoader and multi-node Horovod

Please note there is a bug that causes a hang when using PyTorch's multithreaded data loaders with distributed training across multiple nodes. To workaround this, NVIDIA recommends setting num_workers=0 in the dataloader configuration, which serializes data loading.

<DOCUMENT>Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) mode

MIG mode can be enabled and configured on Polaris by passing a valid configuration file to qsub:

qsub ... -l mig_config=/home/ME/path/to/mig_config.json ...

You can find a concise explanation of MIG concepts and terms at https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/tesla/mig-user-guide/index.html#concepts

Configuration

Please study the following example of a valid configuration file:

shell
{
  ""group1"": {
    ""gpus"": [0,1],
    ""mig_enabled"": true,
    ""instances"": {""7g.40gb"": [""4c.7g.40gb"", ""3c.7g.40gb""] }
  },
  ""group2"": {
    ""gpus"": [2,3],
    ""mig_enabled"": true,
    ""instances"": {""3g.20gb"": [""2c.3g.20gb"", ""1c.3g.20gb""], ""2g.10gb"": [""2g.10gb""], ""1g.5gb"": [""1g.5gb""], ""1g.5gb"": [""1g.5gb""]}
  }
}

Notes

Group names are arbitrary, but must be unique

""gpus"" must be an array of integers.  if only one physical gpu is being configured in a group, it must still be contained within an array(ex. ""gpus"": [0],)

Only groups with mig_enabled set to true will be configured

instances denote the MIG gpu instances and the nested compute instances you wish to be configured

syntax is {""gpu instance 1"": [""cpu instance 1"", ""cpu instance 2""], ...}

valid gpu instances are 1g.5gb, 1g.10gb, 2g.10gb, 3g.20gb, 4g.20gb, and 7g.40gb.  the first number denotes the number of slots used out of 7 total, and the second number denotes memory in GB

the default cpu instance for any gpu instance has the same identifier as the gpu instance(in which case it will be the only one configurable)

other cpu instances can be configured with the identifier syntax Xc.Y, where X is the number of slots available in that gpu instance, and Y is the gpu instance identifier string

some gpu instances cannot be configured adjacently, despite there being sufficient slots/memory remaining(ex. 3g.20gb and 4g.20gb). Please see NVIDIA MIG documentation for further details</DOCUMENT>

<DOCUMENT>Note 1: You cannot submit to these queues directly, you can only submit to the routing queue ""prod"".

Note 2: All of these queues have a limit of ten (10) jobs running/accruing per-project

Note 3: All of these queues have a limit of one hundred (100) jobs queued (not accruing score) per-project

Note 4: As of January 2023, it is recommended to submit jobs with a maximum node count of 476-486 nodes given current rates of downed nodes (larger jobs may sit in the queue indefinitely).

Running MPI+OpenMP Applications

Once a submitted job is running calculations can be launched on the compute nodes using mpiexec to start an MPI application. Documentation is accessible via man mpiexec and some helpful options follow.

-n total number of MPI ranks

-ppn number of MPI ranks per node

--cpu-bind CPU binding for application

--depth number of cpus per rank (useful with --cpu-bind)

--env set environment variables (--env OMP_NUM_THREADS=2)

--hostfile indicate file with hostnames (the default is --hostfile $PBS_NODEFILE)

A sample submission script with directives is below for a 4-node job with 8 MPI ranks on each node and 8 OpenMP threads per rank. Each hardware thread runs a single OpenMP thread since there are 64 hardware threads on the CPU (2 per core).
You can download and compile hello_affinity from this link.

Using pip install --user (not recommended)

!!! danger

With the conda environment setup, one can install common Python modules using
#!bash python3 pip install --users '<module-name>' which will install
packages in #!bash $PYTHONUSERBASE/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages.

The #!bash $PYTHONUSERBASE environment variable is automatically set when you
load the base conda module, and is equal to  #!bash
/home/$USER/.local/polaris/conda/YYYY-MM-DD.

Note, Python modules installed this way that contain command line binaries will
not have those binaries automatically added to the shell's #!bash $PATH. To
manually add the path:

bash
export PATH=""$PYTHONUSERBASE/bin:$PATH""

Be sure to remove this location from #!bash $PATH if you deactivate the base
Anaconda environment or unload the module.

Cloning the Anaconda environment, or using venv are both more flexible and
transparent when compared to #!bash --user installs.</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Use Reduced Precision. Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with PyTorch operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the PyTorch Automatic Mixed Precision package (AMP), as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  In PyTorch, users generally need to manage casting and loss scaling manually,  though context managers and function decorators can provide easy tools to do this.

PyTorch has a JIT module as well as backends to support op fusion, similar to TensorFlow's tf.function tools.  However, PyTorch JIT capabilities are newer and may not yield performance improvements.  Please see TorchScript for more information.

Multi-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up

PyTorch is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with PyTorch has been seen with both DDP and Horovod.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation or the Distributed Data Parallel documentation.  Some Polaris-specific details that may be helpful to you:

CPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.  In particular, we encourage users to try their scaling measurements with the following settings:

Set the environment variable NCCL_COLLNET_ENABLE=1

Set the environment varialbe NCCL_NET_GDR_LEVEL=PHB

Manually set the CPU affinity via mpiexec, such as with --cpu-bind verbose,list:0,8,16,24</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>NVIDIA Compilers on Polaris

The NVIDIA compilers (nvc, nvc++, nvcc, and nvfortran) are available on Polaris via the PrgEnv-nvhpc and nvhpc modules. There is currently a PrgEnv-nvidia module available, but that will soon be deprecated in Cray's PE, thus it is not recommend for use.

The Cray compiler wrappers map to NVIDIA compilers as follows.

cc -> nvc
CC -> nvc++
ftn -> nvfortran

Users are encouraged to look through NVIDIA's documentation for the NVHPC SDK and specific information on the compilers, tools, and libraries.

Notes on NVIDIA Compilers

PGI compilers

The NVIDIA programming environments makes available compilers from the NVIDIA HPC SDK. While the PGI compilers are available in this programming environment, it should be noted they are actually symlinks to the corresponding NVIDIA compilers.
pgcc -> nvc
pgc++ -> nvc++
pgf90 -> nvfortran
pgfortran -> nvfortran
While nvcc is the traditional CUDA C and CUDA C++ compiler for NVIDIA GPUs, the nvc, nvc++, and nvfortran compilers additionally target CPUs.

NVHPC SDK Directory Structure

Users migrating from CUDA toolkits to the NVHPC SDK may find it beneficial to review the directory structure of the hpc-sdk directory to find the location of commonly used libraries (including math libraries for the CPU). With the PrgEnv-nvhpc module loaded, the NVIDIA_PATH environment variable can be used to locate the path to various NVIDIA tools, libraries, and examples.

compiler/bin - cuda-gdb, ncu, nsys, ...

examples - CUDA-Fortran, OpenMP, ...

comm_libs - nccl, nvshmem, ...

compiler/libs - blas, lapack, ...

cuda/lib64 - cudart, OpenCL, ...

<DOCUMENT>Known Issues

This is a collection of known issues that have been encountered on Polaris. Documentation will be updated as issues are resolved. Users are encouraged to email support@alcf.anl.gov to report issues.

Submitting Jobs

For batch job submissions, if the parameters within your submission script do not meet the parameters of any of the execution queues (small, ..., backfill-large) you might not receive the ""Job submission"" error on the command line at all, and the job will never appear in history qstat -xu <username> (current bug in PBS). E.g. if a user submits a script to the prod routing queue requesting 10 nodes for 24 hours, exceeding ""Time Max"" of 6 hrs of the small execution queue (which handles jobs with 10-24 nodes), then it may behave as if the job was never submitted.

Job scripts are copied to temporary locations after qsub and any changes to the original script while the job is queued will not be reflected in the copied script. Furthermore, qalter requires -A <allocation name> when changing job properties. Currently, there is a request for a qalter-like command to trigger a re-copy of the original script to the temporary location.

What is Gromacs?

GROMACS is a versatile package to perform molecular dynamics, i.e. simulate the Newtonian equations of motion for systems with hundreds to millions of particles. It is primarily designed for biochemical molecules like proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids that have a lot of complicated bonded interactions, but since GROMACS is extremely fast at calculating the nonbonded interactions (that usually dominate simulations) many groups are also using it for research on non-biological systems, e.g. polymers.

Using GROMACS at ALCF

<DOCUMENT>Notes

SmartSim workflows, such as online training, often require launching multiple MPI applications on the same set of nodes. On Polaris, the MPICH_OFI_CXI_PID_BASE=0 must be exported before the first call to mpiexec, and then incremented by 1 and re-exported before each successive call. This is done with the SmartSim API by adding env_vars={'MPICH_OFI_CXI_PID_BASE':str(0)} to the PalsMpiexecSettings() API.</DOCUMENT>

What is Gromacs?

GROMACS is a versatile package to perform molecular dynamics, i.e. simulate the Newtonian equations of motion for systems with hundreds to millions of particles. It is primarily designed for biochemical molecules like proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids that have a lot of complicated bonded interactions, but since GROMACS is extremely fast at calculating the nonbonded interactions (that usually dominate simulations) many groups are also using it for research on non-biological systems, e.g. polymers.

Using GROMACS at ALCF

ALCF offers assistance with building binaries and compiling instructions for GROMACS. For questions, contact us at support@alcf.anl.gov.

<DOCUMENT>This variable can be used to inspect software installations and find header or

installation prefix which contains build information and logs.

Building software with Spack

Spack is a powerful package manager designed for HPC.
The Spack PE is installed and managed with Spack; users can also install Spack
in their own home or project directory to manage their software builds. Spack
has a steep learning curve, but it may benefit workflows involving frequent
builds with complex dependencies.

For users who wish to use Spack to install their own software, we provide
configuration files corresponding to the Spack PE deployments. These
configuration files can be found in config directories in /soft/spack within
the respective Spack PE installation directories. For example, the
spack-pe-base/0.6.1 configurations are in /soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/config. Not
all of these settings will be useful for all builds and it is not recommended to
adopt these wholesale as global settings. The recommended method is to include
these settings ad hoc in a spack environment to control what information spack
uses for its builds.

Support requests and feedback should be directed to
support@alcf.anl.gov. For general Spack
questions, users are encouraged to consult the following resources:

You can find a concise explanation of MIG concepts and terms at https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/tesla/mig-user-guide/index.html#concepts

Configuration

Please study the following example of a valid configuration file:

shell
{
  ""group1"": {
    ""gpus"": [0,1],
    ""mig_enabled"": true,
    ""instances"": {""7g.40gb"": [""4c.7g.40gb"", ""3c.7g.40gb""] }
  },
  ""group2"": {
    ""gpus"": [2,3],
    ""mig_enabled"": true,
    ""instances"": {""3g.20gb"": [""2c.3g.20gb"", ""1c.3g.20gb""], ""2g.10gb"": [""2g.10gb""], ""1g.5gb"": [""1g.5gb""], ""1g.5gb"": [""1g.5gb""]}
  }
}

Notes

Group names are arbitrary, but must be unique

""gpus"" must be an array of integers.  if only one physical gpu is being configured in a group, it must still be contained within an array(ex. ""gpus"": [0],)

Only groups with mig_enabled set to true will be configured

instances denote the MIG gpu instances and the nested compute instances you wish to be configured

syntax is {""gpu instance 1"": [""cpu instance 1"", ""cpu instance 2""], ...}

valid gpu instances are 1g.5gb, 1g.10gb, 2g.10gb, 3g.20gb, 4g.20gb, and 7g.40gb.  the first number denotes the number of slots used out of 7 total, and the second number denotes memory in GB

the default cpu instance for any gpu instance has the same identifier as the gpu instance(in which case it will be the only one configurable)

other cpu instances can be configured with the identifier syntax Xc.Y, where X is the number of slots available in that gpu instance, and Y is the gpu instance identifier string

some gpu instances cannot be configured adjacently, despite there being sufficient slots/memory remaining(ex. 3g.20gb and 4g.20gb). Please see NVIDIA MIG documentation for further details</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>LAMMPS

Overview

LAMMPS is a general-purpose molecular dynamics software package for massively parallel computers. It is written in an exceptionally clean style that makes it one of the more popular codes for users to extend and it currently has dozens of user-developed extensions.

For details about the code and its usage, see the LAMMPS home page. This page provides information specific to running on Polaris at the ALCF.

Using LAMMPS at ALCF

ALCF provides assistance with build instructions, compiling executables, submitting jobs, and providing prebuilt binaries (upon request). A collection of Makefiles and submission scripts are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo here. For questions, contact us at support@alcf.anl.gov.

How to Obtain the Code

LAMMPS is an open-source code, which can be downloaded from the LAMMPS website.

Building on Polaris

After LAMMPS has been downloaded and unpacked on an ALCF filesystem, users should see a directory whose name is of the form lammps-<version>. One should then see the Makefile lammps-<version>/src/MAKE/MACHINES/Makefile.polaris in recent versions that can be used as a starting point for compilation on Polaris. Copies of Makefiles for building with the GPU/KOKKOS package using CUDA for GPU support with the GNU/NVHPC compiler are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo here. For older versions of LAMMPS, you may need to take an existing Makefile (e.g. Makefile.mpi) for your specific version of LAMMPS and edit the top portion appropratiately to create a new Makefile.polaris.

KOKKOS package and GNU compilers

The following modules are useful for this particular build. Note, the cmake module is not required if using the GNU Makefile procedure to build LAMMPS. The initial module restore is just setting the default environment as the starting point. Users may find it useful to copy these module commands into a small helper script to assist with compiling and running LAMMPS (e.g. setup_lammps_gnu.sh).</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>LLVM Compilers on Polaris

This page is not about LLVM-based Cray Compiling Environment (CCE) compilers from PrgEnv-cray but about open source LLVM compilers.

If LLVM compilers are needed without MPI support, simply load the llvm module.

Cray Programming Environment does not offer LLVM compiler support.
Thus cc/CC/ftn compiler wrappers using LLVM compilers currently are not available.
To use Clang with MPI, one can load the mpiwrappers/cray-mpich-llvm module which loads the following modules.

llvm, upstream llvm compilers

cray-mpich, MPI compiler wrappers mpicc/mpicxx/mpif90. mpif90 uses gfortran because flang is not ready for production use.

cray-pals, MPI launchers mpiexec/aprun/mpirun

Limitation There is no GPU-aware MPI library linking support by default. If needed, users should manually add the GTL (GPU Transport Layer) library to the application link line.

Update 04/25/2024 To access LLVM modules, module use /soft/modulefiles is required.

OpenMP offload

When targeting the OpenMP or CUDA programming models for GPUs, the cudatoolkit-standalone module should also be loaded.</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>[""OpenMP\n\nOverview\n\nThe OpenMP API is an open standard for parallel programming. The specification document can be found here: https://www.openmp.org.

Note 3: All of these queues have a limit of one hundred (100) jobs queued (not accruing score) per-project

Note 4: As of January 2023, it is recommended to submit jobs with a maximum node count of 476-486 nodes given current rates of downed nodes (larger jobs may sit in the queue indefinitely).

Running MPI+OpenMP Applications

Once a submitted job is running calculations can be launched on the compute nodes using mpiexec to start an MPI application. Documentation is accessible via man mpiexec and some helpful options follow.

-n total number of MPI ranks

-ppn number of MPI ranks per node

--cpu-bind CPU binding for application

--depth number of cpus per rank (useful with --cpu-bind)

--env set environment variables (--env OMP_NUM_THREADS=2)

--hostfile indicate file with hostnames (the default is --hostfile $PBS_NODEFILE)

A sample submission script with directives is below for a 4-node job with 8 MPI ranks on each node and 8 OpenMP threads per rank. Each hardware thread runs a single OpenMP thread since there are 64 hardware threads on the CPU (2 per core).
You can download and compile hello_affinity from this link.

```bash

!/bin/bash -l

NTOTRANKS=$(( NNODES * NRANKS ))

echo ""NUM_OF_NODES= ${NNODES} TOTAL_NUM_RANKS= ${NTOTRANKS} RANKS_PER_NODE= ${NRANKS} THREADS_PER_RANK= ${NTHREADS}""

<DOCUMENT>Compiling and Linking Overview on Polaris

Compiling on Polaris Login and Compute Nodes

If your build system does not require GPUs for the build process, as is usually the case, compilation of GPU-accelerated codes is generally expected to work well on the Polaris login nodes. If your build system does require GPUs, you cannot yet compile on the Polaris login nodes, as they do not currently have GPUs installed. You may in this case compile your applications on the Polaris compute nodes. Do this by submitting an interactive single-node job, or running your build system in a batch job.

Home File System

Is it helpful to realize that there is a single HOME filesystem for users that can be accessed from the login and computes of each production resource at ALCF. Thus, users should be mindful of modifications to their environments (e.g. .bashrc) that may cause issues to arise due to differences between the systems.

Cray Programming Environment

The Cray Programming Environment (PE) uses three compiler wrappers for building software. These compiler wrappers should be used when building MPI-enabled applications.

cc - C compiler

CC - C++ compiler

ftn - Fortran compiler

Each of these wrappers can select a specific vendor compiler based on the PrgEnv module loaded in the environment. The following are some helpful options to understand what the compiler wrapper is invoking.

--craype-verbose : Print the command which is forwarded to the compiler invocation

--cray-print-opts=libs : Print library information

--cray-print-opts=cflags : Print include information

The output from these commands may be useful in build scripts where a compiler other than that invoked by a compiler wrapper is desired. Defining some variables as such may prove useful in those situations.
CRAY_CFLAGS=$(cc --cray-print-opts=cflags)
CRAY_LIB=$(cc --cray-print-opts=libs)
Further documentation and options are available via man cc and similar.

Introduction

NVIDIA® Nsight™ Systems provides developers a system-wide visualization of an applications performance. Developers can optimize bottlenecks to scale efficiently across any number or size of CPUs and GPUs on Polaris. For further optimizations to compute kernels developers should use Nsight Compute.

The NVIDIA Nsight Compute is an interactive kernel profiler for CUDA applications. It provides detailed performance metrics and API debugging via a user interface and command line tool.

In addition, the baseline feature of this tool allows users to compare results within the tool. NVIDIA Nsight Compute provides a customizable and data-driven user interface,  metric collection, and can be extended with analysis scripts for post-processing results.

Context: <DOCUMENT>libEnsemble

libEnsemble is a Python toolkit for running dynamic ensembles of calculations.

Users provide generator and simulator functions to express their ensembles, where the generator can steer the ensemble based on previous results. These functions can portably submit external executables at any scale.

System details are detected, and dynamic resource management is provided. This includes automatically detecting, assigning, and reassigning
GPUs for ensemble members.

libEnsemble can be used in a consistent manner on laptops, clusters, and supercomputers with minimal required dependencies.

Getting libEnsemble on Polaris

libEnsemble is provided on Polaris in the conda module:

See the docs for more details on using python on Polaris.

libEnsemble examples

For a very simple example of using libEnsemble see the Simple Introduction tutorial

For an example that runs a small ensemble using a C application (offloading work to the GPU), see
the GPU app tutorial.
The required files for this tutorial can be found
in this directory.
A video demo is also available.

Job Submission

libEnsemble runs on the compute nodes on Polaris using either Python's
multiprocessing or mpi4py. The user can set the number of workers for
maximum concurrency. libEnsemble will detect the nodes available
from the PBS environment and use these for running simulations. Polaris supports
running multiple concurrent simulations on each node if desired.

A simple example batch script for a libEnsemble use case that runs five workers on one node:

```shell
    #!/bin/bash -l

<DOCUMENT>LAMMPS

Overview

LAMMPS is a general-purpose molecular dynamics software package for massively parallel computers. It is written in an exceptionally clean style that makes it one of the more popular codes for users to extend and it currently has dozens of user-developed extensions.

For details about the code and its usage, see the LAMMPS home page. This page provides information specific to running on Polaris at the ALCF.

Using LAMMPS at ALCF

ALCF provides assistance with build instructions, compiling executables, submitting jobs, and providing prebuilt binaries (upon request). A collection of Makefiles and submission scripts are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo here. For questions, contact us at support@alcf.anl.gov.

How to Obtain the Code

LAMMPS is an open-source code, which can be downloaded from the LAMMPS website.

Building on Polaris

After LAMMPS has been downloaded and unpacked on an ALCF filesystem, users should see a directory whose name is of the form lammps-<version>. One should then see the Makefile lammps-<version>/src/MAKE/MACHINES/Makefile.polaris in recent versions that can be used as a starting point for compilation on Polaris. Copies of Makefiles for building with the GPU/KOKKOS package using CUDA for GPU support with the GNU/NVHPC compiler are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo here. For older versions of LAMMPS, you may need to take an existing Makefile (e.g. Makefile.mpi) for your specific version of LAMMPS and edit the top portion appropratiately to create a new Makefile.polaris.

KOKKOS package and GNU compilers

The following modules are useful for this particular build. Note, the cmake module is not required if using the GNU Makefile procedure to build LAMMPS. The initial module restore is just setting the default environment as the starting point. Users may find it useful to copy these module commands into a small helper script to assist with compiling and running LAMMPS (e.g. setup_lammps_gnu.sh).</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>and launch the ParaView server with

srizzi@x3005c0s7b0n0:~> mpirun -n 8 pvserver --server-port=8000
Waiting for client...
Connection URL: cs://x3005c0s7b0n0:8000
Accepting connection(s): x3005c0s7b0n0:8000

In this case pvserver will be listening on TCP port 8000 of your head node. You can change this port if you want.

Creating a tunnel over ssh

We need to establish an ssh tunnel to connect client to server. On your local machine open a new terminal and type:

ssh -v -N -L 8000:x3005c0s7b0n0:8000 polaris.alcf.anl.gov

where 8000 is a TCP port and x3005c0s7b0n0 the name of your head node. Adjust these values accordingly.

Among multiple lines with debug information,  you should see something like:

debug1: Local connections to LOCALHOST:8000 forwarded to remote address x3005c0s7b0n0:8000

Keep this terminal open for the duration of your session to keep the ssh tunnel active.

Now you are ready to launch your ParaView client locally. Keep in mind that client and servers versions must match. The ParaView version currently deployed on Polaris is 5.12.0

Connecting to ParaView server

Connect your ParaView client to the server configuration you created above. You can select Connect, either from the File menu, or the icon circled in the figure:

and selecting the configuration you created in a previous step.

The connection should point to:

<DOCUMENT>2. Select which data to view

Let's start by looking at the continuum.000*data. This is an unstructured mesh that has velocity and count (density) values.
- Hide other data sets using the Eyeball icon next their names in the Pipeline Browser.
  - Black = visible, Grey = hidden
- Select continuum.000*(name is highlighted) in the Pipeline Browser
  - Click on the name to highlight it
- When manipulating appearance or applying filters, these always affect the selected data set
- Switch to the Display tab in the Object Inspector
- Under Color by, select Velocity from the dropdown
  - There is also a shortcut to Color by in the menu bar near the top of the GUI
  -

3. Manipulating the Color Map

To change the colors used to represent the Velocity:
- Under Color byclick the Edit Color Map... button
- On the Color Scale Editor window click the Choose Preset button
- On the Preset Color Scales window, select: Blue to Red Rainbow, and click OK. Then click Close on the Color Scale Editor window
- You can also create and save your own color maps

4. Data Representation

In order to be able to see the particles and red blood cells inside the cylinder, we need to be able to see through it. If we scroll down a bit in the Object Inspector view:
- Group of controls labeled Style
- In the Representation dropdown, select Wireframe

5. Generate Streamlines

ParaView enables the generation of different types of data from existing data sets in the Pipeline

Streamlines: Generated from vectors of the flow field. These curves show the direction a fluid element will travel in at any point in time

Make sure that the continuum.000*data is selected in the Pipeline Browser

If the application instead relies on the job launcher to bind MPI ranks to available GPUs, then a small helper script can be used to explicitly setCUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` appropriately for each MPI rank. One example is available here where each MPI rank is similarly bound to a single GPU with round-robin assignment. The binding of MPI ranks to GPUs is discussed in more detail here.

GPU OpenCL

A simple OpenCL example is available here. The OpenCL headers and library are available in the NVHPC SDK and cuda toolkits. The environment variable NVIDIA_PATH is defined for the PrgEnv-nvhpc programming environment. 
CC -o vecadd -g -O3 -std=c++0x  -I${NVIDIA_PATH}/cuda/include main.o -L${NVIDIA_PATH}/cuda/lib64 -lOpenCL

This simple example can be run on a Polaris compute node as follows.
```
$ ./vecadd
Running on GPU!
Using single-precision

Result is CORRECT!! :)
```

GPU OpenMP

A simple MPI-parallel OpenMP example is available here. Compilation proceeds similar to the above examples except for use of the -mp=gpu compiler flag to indicated compilation of OpenMP code for GPUs.

CC -g -O3 -std=c++0x -mp=gpu -gpu=cc80,cuda11.0 -c main.cpp -o vecadd

Similar to the OpenACC example above, this code binds MPI ranks to GPUs in a round-robin fashion. 
```
$ mpiexec -n 4 ./vecadd

of devices= 4

Rank 0 running on GPU 0!
Rank 1 running on GPU 1!
Rank 2 running on GPU 2!
Rank 3 running on GPU 3!

Result is CORRECT!! :)

Multi-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up

PyTorch is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with PyTorch has been seen with both DDP and Horovod.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation or the Distributed Data Parallel documentation.  Some Polaris-specific details that may be helpful to you:

CPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.  In particular, we encourage users to try their scaling measurements with the following settings:

Set the environment variable NCCL_COLLNET_ENABLE=1

<DOCUMENT>libEnsemble

libEnsemble is a Python toolkit for running dynamic ensembles of calculations.

Users provide generator and simulator functions to express their ensembles, where the generator can steer the ensemble based on previous results. These functions can portably submit external executables at any scale.

System details are detected, and dynamic resource management is provided. This includes automatically detecting, assigning, and reassigning
GPUs for ensemble members.

libEnsemble can be used in a consistent manner on laptops, clusters, and supercomputers with minimal required dependencies.

Getting libEnsemble on Polaris

libEnsemble is provided on Polaris in the conda module:

See the docs for more details on using python on Polaris.

libEnsemble examples

For a very simple example of using libEnsemble see the Simple Introduction tutorial

For an example that runs a small ensemble using a C application (offloading work to the GPU), see
the GPU app tutorial.
The required files for this tutorial can be found
in this directory.
A video demo is also available.

Job Submission

libEnsemble runs on the compute nodes on Polaris using either Python's
multiprocessing or mpi4py. The user can set the number of workers for
maximum concurrency. libEnsemble will detect the nodes available
from the PBS environment and use these for running simulations. Polaris supports
running multiple concurrent simulations on each node if desired.

A simple example batch script for a libEnsemble use case that runs five workers on one node:

```shell
    #!/bin/bash -l
    #PBS -l select=1:system=polaris
    #PBS -l walltime=00:15:00
    #PBS -l filesystems=home:grand
    #PBS -q debug
    #PBS -A

```

The script can be run with:

Or you can run an interactive session with:

<DOCUMENT>Compiling and Linking Overview on Polaris

Compiling on Polaris Login and Compute Nodes

If your build system does not require GPUs for the build process, as is usually the case, compilation of GPU-accelerated codes is generally expected to work well on the Polaris login nodes. If your build system does require GPUs, you cannot yet compile on the Polaris login nodes, as they do not currently have GPUs installed. You may in this case compile your applications on the Polaris compute nodes. Do this by submitting an interactive single-node job, or running your build system in a batch job.

Home File System

Is it helpful to realize that there is a single HOME filesystem for users that can be accessed from the login and computes of each production resource at ALCF. Thus, users should be mindful of modifications to their environments (e.g. .bashrc) that may cause issues to arise due to differences between the systems.

Cray Programming Environment

The Cray Programming Environment (PE) uses three compiler wrappers for building software. These compiler wrappers should be used when building MPI-enabled applications.

cc - C compiler

CC - C++ compiler

ftn - Fortran compiler

Each of these wrappers can select a specific vendor compiler based on the PrgEnv module loaded in the environment. The following are some helpful options to understand what the compiler wrapper is invoking.

--craype-verbose : Print the command which is forwarded to the compiler invocation

--cray-print-opts=libs : Print library information

--cray-print-opts=cflags : Print include information

The output from these commands may be useful in build scripts where a compiler other than that invoked by a compiler wrapper is desired. Defining some variables as such may prove useful in those situations.
CRAY_CFLAGS=$(cc --cray-print-opts=cflags)
CRAY_LIB=$(cc --cray-print-opts=libs)
Further documentation and options are available via man cc and similar.

Compilers provided by Cray Programming Environments</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Python

We provide prebuilt conda environments containing GPU-supported builds of
torch, tensorflow (both with horovod support for multi-node
calculations), jax, and many other commonly-used Python modules.

Users can activate this environment by first loading the conda module, and
then activating the base environment.

Explicitly (either from an interactive job, or inside a job script):

bash
module use /soft/modulefiles; module load conda ; conda activate base

This will load and activate the base environment.

Virtual environments via venv

To install additional packages that are missing from the base environment,
we can build a venv on top of it.

!!! success ""Conda base environment + venv""

You can always retroactively change the #!bash --system-site-packages flag
state for this virtual environment by editing #!bash ${VENV_DIR}/pyvenv.cfg and
changing the value of the line #!bash include-system-site-packages=false.

To install a different version of a package that is already installed in the
base environment, you can use:

bash
python3 pip install --ignore-installed <package> # or -I

The shared base environment is not writable, so it is impossible to remove or
uninstall packages from it. The packages installed with the above pip command
should shadow those installed in the base environment.

Cloning the base Anaconda environment

!!! warning

If you need more flexibility, you can clone the conda environment into a custom
path, which would then allow for root-like installations via #!bash conda install
<module> or #!bash pip install <module>.

Unlike the venv approach, using a cloned Anaconda environment requires you to
copy the entirety of the base environment, which can use significant storage
space.

To clone the base environment:

bash
module load conda ; conda activate base
conda create --clone base --prefix /path/to/envs/base-clone
conda activate /path/to/envs/base-clone

where, #!bash path/to/envs/base-clone should be replaced by a suitably chosen
path.</DOCUMENT>

<DOCUMENT>Example Programs and Makefiles for Polaris

Several simple examples of building CPU and GPU-enabled codes on Polaris are available in the ALCF GettingStart repo for several programming models. If build your application is problematic for some reason (e.g. absence of a GPU), then users are encouraged to build and test applications directly on one of the Polaris compute nodes via an interactive job. The discussion below makes use of the NVHPC compilers in the default environment as illustrative examples. Similar examples for other compilers on Polaris are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo.

CPU MPI+OpenMP Example

One of the first useful tasks with any new machine, scheduler, and job launcher is to ensure one is binding MPI ranks and OpenMP threads to the host cpu as intended. A simple HelloWorld MPI+OpenMP example is available here to get started with.

The application can be straightforwardly compiled using the Cray compiler wrappers.
CC -fopenmp main.cpp -o hello_affinity

The executable hello_affinity can then be launched in a job script (or directly in shell of interactive job) using mpiexec as discussed here.

```

!/bin/sh

PBS -l select=1:system=polaris

PBS -l place=scatter

PBS -l walltime=0:30:00

PBS -l filesystems=home

MPI example w/ 16 MPI ranks per node spread evenly across cores

Several variants of C/C++ and Fortran CUDA examples are available here that include MPI and multi-gpu examples.

One can use the Cray compiler wrappers to compile GPU-enabled applications as well. This example of simple vector addition uses the NVIDIA compilers.

Sometimes it is convenient to manually launch an instance of the ParaView server. In this section we will explain an alternative method to run the ParaView server on Polaris using an interactive job, where the user can launch the ParaView server from the command line interface.

Note: this is a method better suited for experienced users. If you are just starting with ParaView, we recommend the client/server mode as your primary method for using this tool.

Setting up ParaView

From your local client select Connect, either from the File menu, or by clicking on the icon circled below:

A new window will open where you can configure a server. Click on Add Server:

Give your server a name, select Client/Server, localhost, and a TCP port (8000 in this example)

Click ""Configure"". In the next window there is an option to set up how ParaView server will be launched, and the default is ""Manual"". Leave it on ""Manual"" and click ""Save"".

You will use these settings when establishing the connection.

Launching the ParaView server on Polaris

You can launch an interactive session on Polaris compute nodes with the following command (adjust parameters as needed to match your allocation, desired number of nodes, queue, walltime, and filesystems):

shell
qsub -l walltime=01:00:00 -l select=2 -A yourallocation -q debug -I -l filesystems=home:grand

When the job starts you will receive a prompt on your head node like this:

username@x3005c0s7b0n0:~>

Make a note of the node hostname (x3005c0s7b0n0 in the example above). You can also get this information from qstat -fx jobID

Now load the ParaView module

username@x3005c0s7b0n0:~> module use /soft/modulefiles 
username@x3005c0s7b0n0:~> module load visualization/paraview/paraview-5.12.0-EGL

GPU package

The module environments above can be used to build LAMMPS with the GPU package as well. Copies of Makefiles for building with the GPU package using CUDA for GPU support with the GNU and NVHPC compilers are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo here.

Performance Notes

Some useful information on accelerator packages and expectations can be found on the LAMMPS website here.</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>ParaView and Visit

ParaView module has been updated. For more information, see https://docs.alcf.anl.gov/polaris/visualization/paraview/ and https://docs.alcf.anl.gov/polaris/visualization/paraview-manual-launch/

Visit module is in the process of being updated.

Changes to Memory Limits on Login Nodes

Memory limits were lowered on the logins due to resource contention to 8GB of memory, and 8 cores per user. 
This might result in error messages indicating abnormal process termination for user processes run on logins.

Examples of the error messages people might see are:

nvcc error   : 'cudafe++' died due to signal 9 (Kill signal)

g++-12: fatal error: Killed signal terminated program cc1plus

These errors are likely due to exhausting the per-user resources on a login node as each user is allocated 8 cores and 8GB memory.
To avoid this you can either:

Reduce the parallelism of your compile, such as using -j or -j4 flags

Request a debug node and run your compile there where you will have the full resources of the node at your disposal</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>LAMMPS

Overview

LAMMPS is a general-purpose molecular dynamics software package for massively parallel computers. It is written in an exceptionally clean style that makes it one of the more popular codes for users to extend and it currently has dozens of user-developed extensions.

For details about the code and its usage, see the LAMMPS home page. This page provides information specific to running on Polaris at the ALCF.

Using LAMMPS at ALCF

ALCF provides assistance with build instructions, compiling executables, submitting jobs, and providing prebuilt binaries (upon request). A collection of Makefiles and submission scripts are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo here. For questions, contact us at support@alcf.anl.gov.

How to Obtain the Code

LAMMPS is an open-source code, which can be downloaded from the LAMMPS website.

Building on Polaris

After LAMMPS has been downloaded and unpacked on an ALCF filesystem, users should see a directory whose name is of the form lammps-<version>. One should then see the Makefile lammps-<version>/src/MAKE/MACHINES/Makefile.polaris in recent versions that can be used as a starting point for compilation on Polaris. Copies of Makefiles for building with the GPU/KOKKOS package using CUDA for GPU support with the GNU/NVHPC compiler are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo here. For older versions of LAMMPS, you may need to take an existing Makefile (e.g. Makefile.mpi) for your specific version of LAMMPS and edit the top portion appropratiately to create a new Makefile.polaris.

KOKKOS package and GNU compilers

The following modules are useful for this particular build. Note, the cmake module is not required if using the GNU Makefile procedure to build LAMMPS. The initial module restore is just setting the default environment as the starting point. Users may find it useful to copy these module commands into a small helper script to assist with compiling and running LAMMPS (e.g. setup_lammps_gnu.sh).</DOCUMENT>

User: How do I adjust the number of ranks and depth in an LAMMPS simulation to optimize performance?
Assistant: Adjust `NRANKS` to a value that balances computational efficiency with communication overhead, and adjust `NDEPTH` based on performance measurements.

The base conda environment on Polaris comes with Microsoft's
DeepSpeed pre-installed. Instructions
for using / cloning the base environment can be found here.

A batch submission script for the following example is available
here.

We describe below the steps needed to get started with DeepSpeed on Polaris.

We focus on the cifar example provided in the

<DOCUMENT>Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) mode

MIG mode can be enabled and configured on Polaris by passing a valid configuration file to qsub:

qsub ... -l mig_config=/home/ME/path/to/mig_config.json ...

You can find a concise explanation of MIG concepts and terms at https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/tesla/mig-user-guide/index.html#concepts

Configuration

Please study the following example of a valid configuration file:

shell
{
  ""group1"": {
    ""gpus"": [0,1],
    ""mig_enabled"": true,
    ""instances"": {""7g.40gb"": [""4c.7g.40gb"", ""3c.7g.40gb""] }
  },
  ""group2"": {
    ""gpus"": [2,3],
    ""mig_enabled"": true,
    ""instances"": {""3g.20gb"": [""2c.3g.20gb"", ""1c.3g.20gb""], ""2g.10gb"": [""2g.10gb""], ""1g.5gb"": [""1g.5gb""], ""1g.5gb"": [""1g.5gb""]}
  }
}

Notes

Group names are arbitrary, but must be unique

""gpus"" must be an array of integers.  if only one physical gpu is being configured in a group, it must still be contained within an array(ex. ""gpus"": [0],)

Only groups with mig_enabled set to true will be configured

instances denote the MIG gpu instances and the nested compute instances you wish to be configured

syntax is {""gpu instance 1"": [""cpu instance 1"", ""cpu instance 2""], ...}

valid gpu instances are 1g.5gb, 1g.10gb, 2g.10gb, 3g.20gb, 4g.20gb, and 7g.40gb.  the first number denotes the number of slots used out of 7 total, and the second number denotes memory in GB

the default cpu instance for any gpu instance has the same identifier as the gpu instance(in which case it will be the only one configurable)

other cpu instances can be configured with the identifier syntax Xc.Y, where X is the number of slots available in that gpu instance, and Y is the gpu instance identifier string

some gpu instances cannot be configured adjacently, despite there being sufficient slots/memory remaining(ex. 3g.20gb and 4g.20gb). Please see NVIDIA MIG documentation for further details</DOCUMENT>

<DOCUMENT>OpenMM on Polaris

What is OpenMM?

OpenMM is a high-performance toolkit for molecular simulations that can be used as a stand-alone application or as a library. It provides a combination of flexibility (through custom forces and integrators), openness, and high-performance (especially on recent GPUs).

Using OpenMM at ALCF

ALCF offers assistance with building binaries and compiling instructions for OpenMM. For questions, contact us at support@alcf.anl.gov.

Building OpenMM using Conda module

Notes</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>8. Data Representation: Opacity

Even with the continuum data represented as wireframe, there is still considerable occlusion of the interior structures. In order to further reduce this occlusion by the wireframe, we can make it more transparent.

Again, be sure that the continuum.000*data is selected in the Pipeline Browser

In the Object Inspector make sure the Display tab is selected

In the Object Inspector there is a section titled Style

Set Opacity to 0.2

9. Animating Simulation Data

Since our data has multiple time steps, we can easily animate through them to see how the data changes over time.

Simply click the Play button on the animation bar at the top of the GUI

Pause to make it stop

Loop: With this button toggled on, animation will repeat until stopped

10. Animations

Animations can be saved to disk as a movie file, to be played back later.

From the main menu: File->Save Animation

Animation Settings Dialog: Save Animation

Files of type: AVI files (*.avi)

Enter a name in File name:

Click OK

Movie can be played back with standard media players (Windows Media Player, QuickTime, VLC, etc.)

11. Particles as Glyphs

Glyphs are another way of visually representing data where the attributes of a graphical element are dictated by attributes of the data.

All of the particles are displayed as red points in the graphics window. There are ~39K particles in this particular data set, which makes the display a bit cluttered. In order to both filter some of these out, and create 3D representations for them, let's apply a glyph filter to this data.

Now let's add some of our other data back into the scene. Let's start with the particle data.

Context: <DOCUMENT>Mapping Programming Models to Polaris Modules

The table below offers some suggestions for how to get started setting up your environment on Polaris depending on the programming language and model. Note, mixed C/C++ and Fortran applications should choose the programming environment for the Fortran compiler because of mpi.mod and similar incompatibilities between Fortran-generated files from different compilers. Several simple examples for testing the software environment on Polaris for different programming models are available in the ALCF GettingStart repo.

Note, users are encouraged to use PrgEnv-nvhpc instead of PrgEnv-nvidia as the latter will soon be deprecated in Cray's PE. They are otherwise identical pointing to compilers from the same NVIDIA SDK version.

<DOCUMENT>LLVM Compilers on Polaris

This page is not about LLVM-based Cray Compiling Environment (CCE) compilers from PrgEnv-cray but about open source LLVM compilers.

If LLVM compilers are needed without MPI support, simply load the llvm module.

Cray Programming Environment does not offer LLVM compiler support.
Thus cc/CC/ftn compiler wrappers using LLVM compilers currently are not available.
To use Clang with MPI, one can load the mpiwrappers/cray-mpich-llvm module which loads the following modules.

llvm, upstream llvm compilers

cray-mpich, MPI compiler wrappers mpicc/mpicxx/mpif90. mpif90 uses gfortran because flang is not ready for production use.

cray-pals, MPI launchers mpiexec/aprun/mpirun

Limitation There is no GPU-aware MPI library linking support by default. If needed, users should manually add the GTL (GPU Transport Layer) library to the application link line.

Update 04/25/2024 To access LLVM modules, module use /soft/modulefiles is required.

Horovod works best when you limit the visible devices to only one GPU.  Note that if you import mpi4py or horovod, and then do something like os.environ[""CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES""] = hvd.local_rank(), it may not actually work!  You must set the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable prior to doing MPI.COMM_WORLD.init(), which is done in horovod.init() as well as implicitly in from mpi4py import MPI.   On Polaris specifically, you can use the environment variable PMI_LOCAL_RANK (as well as PMI_LOCAL_SIZE) to learn information about the node-local MPI ranks.

<DOCUMENT>TensorFlow on Polaris

TensorFlow is a popular, open-source deep learning framework developed and released by Google.  The TensorFlow home page has more information about TensorFlow, which you can refer to.  For trouble shooting on Polaris, please contact support@alcf.anl.gov.

Installation on Polaris

TensorFlow is already pre-installed on Polaris, available in the conda module.  To use it from a compute node, please do:

bash
module load conda
conda activate

Then, you can load TensorFlow in python as usual (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):

```python

import tensorflow as tf
tf.version
'2.9.1'

```

This installation of TensorFlow was built from source and the CUDA libraries it uses are found via the CUDA_HOME environment variable (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):

bash
$ echo $CUDA_HOME
/soft/datascience/cuda/cuda_11.5.2_495.29.05_linux

If you need to build applications that use this version of TensorFlow and CUDA, we recommend using these cuda libraries to ensure compatibility.  We periodically update the TensorFlow release, though updates will come in the form of new versions of the conda module.

TensorFlow is also available through NVIDIA containers that have been translated to Singularity containers.  For more information about containers, please see the Containers documentation page.

TensorFlow Best Practices on Polaris

Single Node Performance

When running TensorFlow applications, we have found the following practices to be generally, if not universally, useful and encourage you to try some of these techniques to boost performance of your own applications.

Use Reduced Precision. Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with TensorFlow operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the tf.keras.mixed_precision Policy, as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  If you use a custom training loop (and not keras.Model.fit), you will also need to apply loss scaling.</DOCUMENT>

Note: By default, there is no GPU-aware MPI library linking support.  The example above shows how the user can enable the linking by specifying the path to the GTL (GPU Transport Layer) library (libmpi_gtl_cuda) to the link line.

oneAPI Math Kernel Library (oneMKL) Interfaces

oneMKL Interfaces is an open-source implementation of the oneMKL Data Parallel C++ (DPC++) interface according to the oneMKL specification. It works with multiple devices (backends) using device-specific libraries underneath.

oneMKL is part of oneAPI. Various backend supported are shown below. More Information here.

Context: <DOCUMENT>Polaris System Updates

2024-04-22

The management software on Polaris has been upgraded to HPCM 1.10
The following version changes are in place with the upgrade to HPCM 1.10:

HPE Cray Programming Environment (CPE) 23.12

SlingShot version 2.1.2

NVIDIA SDK 23.9

NVIDIA driver version 535.154.05

CUDA 12.2

SUSE 15 SP5

Releasing jobs

Jobs that were queued before the upgrade have been restored to the appropriate queues but are placed on user hold. 
Jobs are not expected to complete successfully due to the changes made to the system and software environments resulting from the upgrade. 
We recommend you review your jobs and either release the hold (qrls <jobid>) or delete it (qdel <jobid>) and resubmit as appropriate.

Users need to rebuild for the new PE environment and major OS upgrade. Existing binaries are unlikely to run successfully.

We have held all jobs submitted prior to the upgrade as a user hold. Users may release their existing jobs with qrls to run after they have rebuilt their binaries.

PBS does cache the job execution script.  If a change to the script is required due to a path changing post rebuild, the job will have to be resubmitted.

All application binaries should be rebuilt prior to further job submissions.

Re-building user codes

Many user codes will need to be re-built and/or re-linked against the newer version of the programming environment (23.12) and Spack provided dependencies.

Changes to the user software environment

In addition to the system upgrades, several changes have been made to the user
software environment which may impact user workflows.

Older PE versions removed

Older versions of the Cray PE (older than 23.12) are deprecated as they are incompatible with the
upgraded system stack and are no longer available for use.

Datascience Anaconda Module Updates</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>libEnsemble

libEnsemble is a Python toolkit for running dynamic ensembles of calculations.

Users provide generator and simulator functions to express their ensembles, where the generator can steer the ensemble based on previous results. These functions can portably submit external executables at any scale.

System details are detected, and dynamic resource management is provided. This includes automatically detecting, assigning, and reassigning
GPUs for ensemble members.

libEnsemble can be used in a consistent manner on laptops, clusters, and supercomputers with minimal required dependencies.

Getting libEnsemble on Polaris

libEnsemble is provided on Polaris in the conda module:

See the docs for more details on using python on Polaris.

libEnsemble examples

For a very simple example of using libEnsemble see the Simple Introduction tutorial

For an example that runs a small ensemble using a C application (offloading work to the GPU), see
the GPU app tutorial.
The required files for this tutorial can be found
in this directory.
A video demo is also available.

Job Submission

libEnsemble runs on the compute nodes on Polaris using either Python's
multiprocessing or mpi4py. The user can set the number of workers for
maximum concurrency. libEnsemble will detect the nodes available
from the PBS environment and use these for running simulations. Polaris supports
running multiple concurrent simulations on each node if desired.

A simple example batch script for a libEnsemble use case that runs five workers on one node:

```shell
    #!/bin/bash -l
    #PBS -l select=1:system=polaris
    #PBS -l walltime=00:15:00
    #PBS -l filesystems=home:grand
    #PBS -q debug
    #PBS -A

```

The script can be run with:

<DOCUMENT>mpi4Jax is a relatively new project and requires setting some environment variables for good performance and usability:
- Set MPI4JAX_USE_CUDA_MPI=1 to use CUDA-Aware MPI, supported in the conda module, to do operations directly from the GPU.
- Set MPICH_GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED=1 to use CUDA-Aware MPI.

The following code, based off of a test script from the mpi4jax repository, can help you verify you are using mpi4jax properly:

```python
import os
from mpi4py import MPI
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
import mpi4jax

comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD
rank = comm.Get_rank()
local_rank = int(os.environ[""PMI_LOCAL_RANK""])

available_devices = jax.devices(""gpu"")
if len(available_devices) <= local_rank:
    raise Exception(""Could not find enough GPUs"")

target_device = available_devices[local_rank]

@jax.jit
def foo(arr):
   arr = arr + rank
   arr_sum, _ = mpi4jax.allreduce(arr, op=MPI.SUM, comm=comm)
   return arr_sum

with jax.default_device(target_device):
    a = jnp.zeros((3, 3))

    result = foo(a)
    print(f""Rank {rank}, local rank {local_rank}, result.device is {result.device()}"")

Queues

There are five production queues you can target in your qsub (-q <queue name>):

Queue Name Node Min Node Max Time Min Time Max Notes debug 1 2 5 min 1 hr max 24 nodes in use by this queue ay any given time; Only 8 nodes are exclusive (see Note below) debug-scaling 1 10 5 min 1 hr max 1 job running/accruing/queued per-user prod 10 496 5 min 24 hrs Routing queue; See below preemptable 1 10 5 min 72 hrs Please be aware that jobs in the preemptable queue can be killed at any time if jobs are submitted to the demand queue. Max 20 jobs running/accruing/queued per-project ; see Note below demand 1 56 5 min 1 hr By request only ; max 100 jobs running/accruing/queued per-project

Note: Please be aware that jobs in the preemptable queue can be killed at any time if jobs are submitted to the demand queue.
Jobs in the demand queue take priority over jobs in the preemptable queue.
This means jobs in the preemptable queue may be preempted (killed without any warning) if there are jobs in the demand queue.
Unfortunately, there's always an inherent risk of jobs being killed when using the preemptable queue. 
Please use the following command to view details of a queue: qstat -Qf <queuename>

To make your job re-runable add the following PBS directive: #PBS -r y This will ensure your job will restart once the demand job is complete.

Note: The debug queue has 8 exclusively dedicated nodes.
If there are free nodes in production, then debug jobs can take another 16 nodes for a total of 24.

prod is routing queue and routes your job to one of the following six execution queues:

Context: <DOCUMENT>Spack PE

Spack is an HPC-oriented package manager which ALCF uses to install software for
the user environment.

ALCF's Spack PE is a Spack-managed software stack which provides various build
tools, utilities, and libraries. It consists of a base stack (spack-pe-base)
and PrgEnv-dependent stacks (currently spack-pe-gnu).

spack-pe-base contains commonplace software compiled for CPU with the system
GCC compilers. Accordingly, the software in spack-pe-base can be used
regardless of programming environment.

spack-pe-gnu is based on the E4S Project and
provides performant HPC libraries built with PrgEnv-gnu and the nvcc CUDA
compiler driver for GPU code. spack-pe-gnu is dependent on both
spack-pe-base and PrgEnv-gnu.

Using software from the Spack PE

The base suite of software tools and libraries can be accessed by loading the
spack-pe-base module. This adds a path to $MODULEPATH which contains
numerous modules.

For example, to load cmake starting from the default environment, a user
should run the following commands:
module use /soft/modulefiles
module load spack-pe-base
module load cmake

The spack-pe-base module adds paths to the user's MODULEPATH; individual packages are subsequently loaded through the newly available modules. The full list of available packages can be viewed by running module avail or module --show-hidden avail for a complete listing. Packages are loaded in the same way from spack-pe-gnu.

Inspecting packages

When a module in the Spack PE is loaded, several environment variables are
updated to integrate the package into the user's environment. Additionally, the
PACKAGE_ROOT variable is set to the path to the installation prefix of the
package. For example, after loading cmake as above:

$ echo $CMAKE_ROOT
/soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/install/linux-sles15-x86_64/gcc-12.3.0/cmake-3.27.7-a435jtzvweeos2es6enirbxdjdqhqgdp/

module load spack-pe-base cmake

NVIDIA CUDA-GDB Documentation

Introduction

CUDA-GDB is the NVIDIA tool for debugging CUDA applications running on Polaris. CUDA-GDB is an extension to GDB, the GNU Project debugger. The tool provides developers with a mechanism for debugging CUDA applications running on actual hardware. This enables developers to debug applications without the potential variations introduced by simulation and emulation environments.

Step-by-step guide

Debug Compilation

NVCC, the NVIDIA CUDA compiler driver, provides a mechanism for generating the debugging information necessary for CUDA-GDB to work properly. The -g -G option pair must be passed to NVCC when an application is compiled for ease of debugging with CUDA-GDB; for example,
nvcc -g -G foo.cu -o foo
Using this line to compile the CUDA application foo.cu
* forces -O0 compilation, with the exception of very limited dead-code eliminations and register-spilling optimizations.
* makes the compiler include debug information in the executable

Running CUDA-gdb on Polaris compute nodes

Start an interactive job mode on Polaris as follows:

```
$ qsub -I -l select=1 -l walltime=1:00:00

$ cuda-gdb --version

<DOCUMENT>In case you want write portable GPU kernels we highly recommend the KernelAbstractions.jl package. It provides a high-level abstraction for writing GPU kernels that can be compiled for different GPU backends.

julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(""KernelAbstractions"")'

By loading either oneAPI.jl, AMDGPU.jl, or CUDA.jl (see quickstart guide below).

CUDA-aware MPI

MPI.jl supports CUDA-aware MPI. This is enabled by setting the following environment variables.

bash
export JULIA_CUDA_MEMORY_POOL=none
export MPICH_GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED=1
export JULIA_MPI_PATH=${CRAY_MPICH_DIR}
export JULIA_MPI_HAS_CUDA=1

Note that MPI.jl needs to be rebuilt for the changes to take effect.

bash
julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.build(""MPI"")'

HDF5 Support

Parallel HDF5 support is provided by
module load cray-hdf5-parallel
After setting export JULIA_HDF5_PATH=$HDF5_DIR we can install the HDF5.jl package.

julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(""HDF5"")'

To remove warning messages indicating that use of JULIA_HDF5_PATH has been deprecated, one can use the following command to set the HDF5 libraries.

```
$ echo $CRAY_HDF5_PARALLEL_PREFIX/
/opt/cray/pe/hdf5-parallel/1.12.2.9/nvidia/23.3

$ julia --project -e 'using HDF5; HDF5.API.set_libraries!(""/opt/cray/pe/hdf5-parallel/1.12.2.9/nvidia/23.3/lib/libhdf5.so"", ""/opt/cray/pe/hdf5-parallel/1.12.2.9/nvidia/23.3/lib/libhdf5_hl.so"")'
```

Quickstart Guide

The following example shows how to use MPI.jl, CUDA.jl, and HDF5.jl to write a
parallel program that computes the sum of two vectors on the GPU and writes the
result to an HDF5 file. A repository with an example code computing an
approximation of pi can be found at
Polaris.jl. In this repository, you will also find
a setup_polaris.sh script that will build the HDF5.jl and MPI.jl package for the system libraries.
The dependencies are installed with the following commands:

updated to integrate the package into the user's environment. Additionally, the
PACKAGE_ROOT variable is set to the path to the installation prefix of the
package. For example, after loading cmake as above:

$ echo $CMAKE_ROOT
/soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/install/linux-sles15-x86_64/gcc-12.3.0/cmake-3.27.7-a435jtzvweeos2es6enirbxdjdqhqgdp/
$ ls -a $CMAKE_ROOT
.  ..  bin  doc  share  .spack</DOCUMENT>

User: How do I access the base suite of software tools and libraries in Spack PE?
Assistant: Load the spack-pe-base module by running ""module load spack-pe-base"" and then view available packages with ""module avail"" or ""module --show-hidden avail"".

Context: <DOCUMENT>Spack PE

Spack is an HPC-oriented package manager which ALCF uses to install software for
the user environment.

ALCF's Spack PE is a Spack-managed software stack which provides various build
tools, utilities, and libraries. It consists of a base stack (spack-pe-base)
and PrgEnv-dependent stacks (currently spack-pe-gnu).

spack-pe-base contains commonplace software compiled for CPU with the system
GCC compilers. Accordingly, the software in spack-pe-base can be used
regardless of programming environment.

spack-pe-gnu is based on the E4S Project and
provides performant HPC libraries built with PrgEnv-gnu and the nvcc CUDA
compiler driver for GPU code. spack-pe-gnu is dependent on both
spack-pe-base and PrgEnv-gnu.

Using software from the Spack PE

The base suite of software tools and libraries can be accessed by loading the
spack-pe-base module. This adds a path to $MODULEPATH which contains
numerous modules.

For example, to load cmake starting from the default environment, a user
should run the following commands:
module use /soft/modulefiles
module load spack-pe-base
module load cmake

The spack-pe-base module adds paths to the user's MODULEPATH; individual packages are subsequently loaded through the newly available modules. The full list of available packages can be viewed by running module avail or module --show-hidden avail for a complete listing. Packages are loaded in the same way from spack-pe-gnu.

Inspecting packages

When a module in the Spack PE is loaded, several environment variables are
updated to integrate the package into the user's environment. Additionally, the
PACKAGE_ROOT variable is set to the path to the installation prefix of the
package. For example, after loading cmake as above:

$ echo $CMAKE_ROOT
/soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/install/linux-sles15-x86_64/gcc-12.3.0/cmake-3.27.7-a435jtzvweeos2es6enirbxdjdqhqgdp/
$ ls -a $CMAKE_ROOT
.  ..  bin  doc  share  .spack</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Compilers provided by Cray Programming Environments

The default programming environment on Polaris is currently NVHPC. The GNU compilers are available via another programming environment. The following sequence of module commands can be used to switch to the GNU programming environment (gcc, g++, gfortran) and also have NVIDIA compilers available in your path.

module swap PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-gnu
module load nvhpc-mixed

The compilers invoked by the Cray MPI wrappers are listed for each programming environment in the following table.

module C C++ Fortran MPI Compiler Wrapper cc CC ftn PrgEnv-nvhpc nvc nvc++ nvfortran PrgEnv-gnu gcc g++ gfortran

Note, while gcc and g++ may be available in the default environment, the PrgEnv-gnu module is needed to provide gfortran.

Additional Compilers Provided by ALCF

The ALCF additionally provides compilers to enable the OpenMP and SYCL programming models for GPUs viaLLVM as documented here

Additional documentation for using compilers is available on the respective programming model pages: OpenMP and SYCL.

Linking

Dynamic linking of libraries is currently the default on Polaris. The Cray MPI wrappers will handle this automatically.

Notes on Default Modules

craype-x86-rome: While the Polaris compute nodes currently have Milan CPUs, this module is loaded by default to avoid the craype-x86-milan module from adding a zen3 target not supported in the default nvhpc/21.9 compilers. The craype-x86-milan module is expected to be made default once a newer nvhpc version (e.g. 22.5) is made the default.

craype-accel-nvidia80: This module adds compiler flags to enable GPU acceleration for NVHPC compilers along with gpu-enabled MPI libraries as it is assumed that the majority of applications to be compiled on Polaris will target the GPUs for acceleration. Users building cpu-only applications may find it useful to unload this module to silence ""gpu code generation"" warnings.

Mixed C/C++ & Fortran Applications</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Use TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.  Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.  When possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention.

Use XLA compilation on your code.  XLA is the Accelerated Linear Algebra library that is available in tensorFlow and critical in software like JAX.  XLA will compile a tf.Graph object, generated with tf.function or similar, and perform optimizations like operation-fusion.  XLA can give impressive performance boosts with almost no user changes except to set an environment variable TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2.  If your code is complex, or has dynamically sized tensors (tensors where the shape changes every iteration), XLA can be detrimental: the overhead for compiling functions can be large enough to mitigate performance improvements.  XLA is particularly powerful when combined with reduced precision, yielding speedups > 100% in some models.

Multi-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up

TensorFlow is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with tensorFlow has been seen with horovod in particular.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation.  Some polaris specific details that may be helpful to you:

CPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.  In particular, we encourage users to try their scaling measurements with the following settings:

Context: <DOCUMENT>Controlling Where Your Job Runs

If you wish to have your job run on specific nodes form your select like this: -l select=1:vnode=<node name1>+1:vnode=<node name2>... . Obviously, that gets tedious for large jobs.

If you want to control the location of a few nodes, for example 2 out of 64, but the rest don't matter, you can do something like this: -l select=1:vnode=<node name1>+1:vnode=<node name2>+62:system=foo

Every node has a PBS resource called tier0 with a rack identifier and tier1 with a dragonfly group identifieer.  If you want all your nodes grouped in a rack, you can add the group specifier -l select=8:system=foo,place=scatter:group=tier0.  If you wanted everything in the same dragonfly group, replace tier0 with tier1.  Note that you have to also explicitly specify the place when you use group.  If you wanted a specific rack or dragonfly group instead of any of them, you are back to the select: -l select 10:tier0=x3001-g0.

Network: Rack and Dragonfly Group Mappings

Racks contain (7) 6U chassis; each chassis has 2 nodes for 14 nodes per rack

The hostnames are of the form xRRPPc0sUUb[0|1]n0 where:
RR is the row {30, 31, 32}
PP is the position in the row {30 goes 1-16, 31 and 32 go 1-12}
c is chassis and is always 0
s stands for slot, but in this case is the RU in the rack and values are {1,7,13,19,25,31,37}
b is BMC controller and is 0 or 1 (each node has its own BMC)
n is node, but is always 0 since there is only one node per BMC

So, 16+12+12 = 40 racks * 14 nodes per rack = 560 nodes.

Note that in production group 9 (the last 4 racks) will be the designated on-demand racks

The management racks are x3000 and X3100 and are dragonfly group 10

The TDS rack is x3200 and is dragonfly group 11</DOCUMENT>

Building software with Spack

Spack is a powerful package manager designed for HPC.
The Spack PE is installed and managed with Spack; users can also install Spack
in their own home or project directory to manage their software builds. Spack
has a steep learning curve, but it may benefit workflows involving frequent
builds with complex dependencies.

For users who wish to use Spack to install their own software, we provide
configuration files corresponding to the Spack PE deployments. These
configuration files can be found in config directories in /soft/spack within
the respective Spack PE installation directories. For example, the
spack-pe-base/0.6.1 configurations are in /soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/config. Not
all of these settings will be useful for all builds and it is not recommended to
adopt these wholesale as global settings. The recommended method is to include
these settings ad hoc in a spack environment to control what information spack
uses for its builds.

Support requests and feedback should be directed to
support@alcf.anl.gov. For general Spack
questions, users are encouraged to consult the following resources:

<DOCUMENT>Datascience Anaconda Module Updates

We have updated the datascience Anaconda module and built various packages and libraries with CUDA 12.4.1 to be compatible with 
the new Polaris NVIDIA GPU hardware driver (CUDA 12.2) and to use the latest MPI, NCCL, cuDNN, TensorRT, etc. libraries. 
PyTorch 2.3.0 and TensorFlow 2.16.1 are now available as part of this module.

To use the new environment, type:
module use /soft/modulefiles 
module load conda; conda activate

/soft refresh and default $MODULEPATH change

Due to the new system software stack, /soft has been purged to allow for
software to be rebuilt. In addition, /soft/modulefiles is no longer in the
default $MODULEPATH. To access modules installed in /soft, users should run
module use /soft/modulefiles.

Adding module use /soft/modulefiles to your profile should approximate the old behavior.

Context: <DOCUMENT>Parsl on Polaris

Parsl is a flexible and scalable parallel programming library for Python.

-- Parsl Documentation

For many applications, managing an ensemble of jobs into a workflow is a critical step that can easily become a performance bottleneck.  Many tools exist to address this, of which parsl is just one.  On this page, we'll highlight some of the key pieces of information about parsl that are relevant to Polaris.  Parsl is also extensively documented, has a dedicated Slack Channel, and a large community of users and developers beyond ALCF.  We encourage you to engage with the parsl community for support with parsl specific questions, and for Polaris-specific questions or problems, please contact support@alcf.anl.gov.

Getting Parsl on Polaris

You can install parsl building off of the conda modules.  You have some flexibility in how you want to extend the conda module to include parsl, but here is an example way to do it:

```python

Load the Conda Module (needed everytime you use parsl)

module load conda
conda activate

Create a virtual env that uses the conda env as the system packages.

Only do the next line on initial set up:

python -m venv --system-site-packages /path/to/your/virtualenv

Load the virtual env (every time):

source /path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/activate

Install parsl (only once)

pip install parsl

```

Using Parsl on Polaris

Parsl has a variety of possible configuration settings.  As an example, we provide the configuration below that will run one task per GPU:

```python
from parsl.config import Config

PBSPro is the right provider for Polaris:

from parsl.providers import PBSProProvider

The high throughput executor is for scaling to HPC systems:

from parsl.executors import HighThroughputExecutor

You can use the MPI launcher, but may want the Gnu Parallel launcher, see below

from parsl.launchers import MpiExecLauncher, GnuParallelLauncher

address_by_interface is needed for the HighThroughputExecutor:</DOCUMENT>

<DOCUMENT>Known Issues

This is a collection of known issues that have been encountered on Polaris. Documentation will be updated as issues are resolved. Users are encouraged to email support@alcf.anl.gov to report issues.

Submitting Jobs

For batch job submissions, if the parameters within your submission script do not meet the parameters of any of the execution queues (small, ..., backfill-large) you might not receive the ""Job submission"" error on the command line at all, and the job will never appear in history qstat -xu <username> (current bug in PBS). E.g. if a user submits a script to the prod routing queue requesting 10 nodes for 24 hours, exceeding ""Time Max"" of 6 hrs of the small execution queue (which handles jobs with 10-24 nodes), then it may behave as if the job was never submitted.

Job scripts are copied to temporary locations after qsub and any changes to the original script while the job is queued will not be reflected in the copied script. Furthermore, qalter requires -A <allocation name> when changing job properties. Currently, there is a request for a qalter-like command to trigger a re-copy of the original script to the temporary location.

Special notes for Polaris

On Polaris, there is a known bug where python applications launched with mpi and that use fork to spawn processes can sometimes have unexplaned hangs.  For this reason, it is recommended to use start_method=""spawn"" on Polaris when using the MpiExecLauncher as is shown in the example config above.  Alternatively, another solution is to use the GNUParallelLauncher which uses GNU Parallel to spawn processes.  GNU Parallel can be loaded in your environment with the command module load gnu-parallel.  Both of these approaches will circumvent the hang issue from using fork.

Updates

For parsl versions after July 2023, the address passed in the HighThroughputExecutor needs to be set to address = address_by_interface(""bond0"").  With parsl versions prior to July 2023, it was recommended to use address = address_by_hostname() on Polaris, but with later versions this will not work on Polaris (or any other machine).</DOCUMENT>

builds with complex dependencies.

For users who wish to use Spack to install their own software, we provide
configuration files corresponding to the Spack PE deployments. These
configuration files can be found in config directories in /soft/spack within
the respective Spack PE installation directories. For example, the
spack-pe-base/0.6.1 configurations are in /soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/config. Not
all of these settings will be useful for all builds and it is not recommended to
adopt these wholesale as global settings. The recommended method is to include
these settings ad hoc in a spack environment to control what information spack
uses for its builds.

Support requests and feedback should be directed to
support@alcf.anl.gov. For general Spack
questions, users are encouraged to consult the following resources:

Login nodes

There are four login nodes available to users for editing code, building code, submitting / monitoring jobs, checking usage (sbank), etc..  Their full hostnames are polaris-login-N.hsn.cm.polaris.alcf.anl.gov  for N equal to 01 through 04; there are an additional two login nodes that are not user-accessible which are used for running services such as JupyterHub. The various compilers and libraries are present on the logins, so most users should be able to build their code.  However, if your build requires the physical presence of the GPU, you will need to build on a compute node.

All users share the same login nodes so please be courteous and respectful of your fellow users.  For example, please do not run computationally or IO intensive pre- or post-processing on the logins and keep the parallelism of your builds to a reasonable level.

<DOCUMENT>Use Reduced Precision. Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with PyTorch operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the PyTorch Automatic Mixed Precision package (AMP), as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  In PyTorch, users generally need to manage casting and loss scaling manually,  though context managers and function decorators can provide easy tools to do this.

PyTorch has a JIT module as well as backends to support op fusion, similar to TensorFlow's tf.function tools.  However, PyTorch JIT capabilities are newer and may not yield performance improvements.  Please see TorchScript for more information.

Multi-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up

PyTorch is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with PyTorch has been seen with both DDP and Horovod.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation or the Distributed Data Parallel documentation.  Some Polaris-specific details that may be helpful to you:

CPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.  In particular, we encourage users to try their scaling measurements with the following settings:

Set the environment variable NCCL_COLLNET_ENABLE=1

Set the environment varialbe NCCL_NET_GDR_LEVEL=PHB

Manually set the CPU affinity via mpiexec, such as with --cpu-bind verbose,list:0,8,16,24</DOCUMENT>

<DOCUMENT>Parsl on Polaris

Parsl is a flexible and scalable parallel programming library for Python.

-- Parsl Documentation

For many applications, managing an ensemble of jobs into a workflow is a critical step that can easily become a performance bottleneck.  Many tools exist to address this, of which parsl is just one.  On this page, we'll highlight some of the key pieces of information about parsl that are relevant to Polaris.  Parsl is also extensively documented, has a dedicated Slack Channel, and a large community of users and developers beyond ALCF.  We encourage you to engage with the parsl community for support with parsl specific questions, and for Polaris-specific questions or problems, please contact support@alcf.anl.gov.

Getting Parsl on Polaris

You can install parsl building off of the conda modules.  You have some flexibility in how you want to extend the conda module to include parsl, but here is an example way to do it:

```python

Load the Conda Module (needed everytime you use parsl)

module load conda
conda activate

Create a virtual env that uses the conda env as the system packages.

Only do the next line on initial set up:

python -m venv --system-site-packages /path/to/your/virtualenv

Load the virtual env (every time):

source /path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/activate

Install parsl (only once)

pip install parsl

```

Using Parsl on Polaris

Parsl has a variety of possible configuration settings.  As an example, we provide the configuration below that will run one task per GPU:

```python
from parsl.config import Config

PBSPro is the right provider for Polaris:

from parsl.providers import PBSProProvider

The high throughput executor is for scaling to HPC systems:

from parsl.executors import HighThroughputExecutor

You can use the MPI launcher, but may want the Gnu Parallel launcher, see below

from parsl.launchers import MpiExecLauncher, GnuParallelLauncher

address_by_interface is needed for the HighThroughputExecutor:</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>bash
juliaup add release

Julia Project Environment

The Julia built-in package manager allows you to create a project and enable
project-specific dependencies. Julia manages packages in the Julia depot located
by default in ~/.julia. However, that NFS filesystem is not meant for
high-speed access. Therefore, this Julia depot folder should be located on a
fast filesystem of your choice (grand, eagle). The Julia depot directory is
set via the environment variable JULIA_DEPOT_PATH. For example, you can set
the Julia depot to a directory on Polaris grand filesystem by adding the following line
to your ~/.bashrc file:

bash
export JULIA_DEPOT_PATH=/grand/$PROJECT/$USER/julia_depot

Programming Julia on Polaris

There are three key components to using Julia for large-scale computations:

MPI support through MPI.jl

GPU support through CUDA.jl

HDF5 support through HDF5.jl

In addition, we recommend VSCode with the Julia
extension for a modern IDE experience, together
with the ssh-remote extension for remote interactive development.

MPI Support

MPI support is provided through the MPI.jl.
bash
$ julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(""MPI"")'
This will install the MPI.jl package and default MPI prebuilt binaries provided by an artifact. For on-node debugging purposes the default artifact is sufficient. However, for large-scale computations, it is important to use the Cray MPICH installed on Polaris. As of MPI.jl v0.20 this is handled through MPIPrefences.jl.
$ julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(""MPIPreferences"")'
$ julia --project -e 'using MPIPreferences; MPIPreferences.use_system_binary(vendor=""cray"")'

The vendor=""cray"" option is important if you intend to use gpu-aware MPI in your applications.

Check that the correct MPI library is targeted with Julia.
```
julia --project -e 'using MPI; MPI.versioninfo()'
MPIPreferences:
  binary:  system
  abi:     MPICH
  libmpi:  libmpi_nvidia.so
  mpiexec: mpiexec</DOCUMENT>

Changes to Memory Limits on Login Nodes

Memory limits were lowered on the logins due to resource contention to 8GB of memory, and 8 cores per user. 
This might result in error messages indicating abnormal process termination for user processes run on logins.

Examples of the error messages people might see are:

nvcc error   : 'cudafe++' died due to signal 9 (Kill signal)

g++-12: fatal error: Killed signal terminated program cc1plus

These errors are likely due to exhausting the per-user resources on a login node as each user is allocated 8 cores and 8GB memory.
To avoid this you can either:

Reduce the parallelism of your compile, such as using -j or -j4 flags

Request a debug node and run your compile there where you will have the full resources of the node at your disposal</DOCUMENT>

Special notes for Polaris

On Polaris, there is a known bug where python applications launched with mpi and that use fork to spawn processes can sometimes have unexplaned hangs.  For this reason, it is recommended to use start_method=""spawn"" on Polaris when using the MpiExecLauncher as is shown in the example config above.  Alternatively, another solution is to use the GNUParallelLauncher which uses GNU Parallel to spawn processes.  GNU Parallel can be loaded in your environment with the command module load gnu-parallel.  Both of these approaches will circumvent the hang issue from using fork.

Updates

For parsl versions after July 2023, the address passed in the HighThroughputExecutor needs to be set to address = address_by_interface(""bond0"").  With parsl versions prior to July 2023, it was recommended to use address = address_by_hostname() on Polaris, but with later versions this will not work on Polaris (or any other machine).</DOCUMENT>

Context: <DOCUMENT>Known Issues

This is a collection of known issues that have been encountered on Polaris. Documentation will be updated as issues are resolved. Users are encouraged to email support@alcf.anl.gov to report issues.

Submitting Jobs

For batch job submissions, if the parameters within your submission script do not meet the parameters of any of the execution queues (small, ..., backfill-large) you might not receive the ""Job submission"" error on the command line at all, and the job will never appear in history qstat -xu <username> (current bug in PBS). E.g. if a user submits a script to the prod routing queue requesting 10 nodes for 24 hours, exceeding ""Time Max"" of 6 hrs of the small execution queue (which handles jobs with 10-24 nodes), then it may behave as if the job was never submitted.

Job scripts are copied to temporary locations after qsub and any changes to the original script while the job is queued will not be reflected in the copied script. Furthermore, qalter requires -A <allocation name> when changing job properties. Currently, there is a request for a qalter-like command to trigger a re-copy of the original script to the temporary location.

<DOCUMENT>QMCPACK on Polaris

QMCPACK, is a modern high-performance open-source Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation code. Its main applications are electronic structure calculations of molecular, quasi-2D and solid-state systems. Variational Monte Carlo (VMC), diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) and a number of other advanced QMC algorithms are implemented. Orbital space auxiliary field QMC (AFQMC) has recently been added. By directly solving the Schrodinger equation, QMC methods offer greater accuracy than methods such as density functional theory, but at a trade-off of much greater computational expense.

Prebuilt executables are provided at /soft/applications/qmcpack.

<DOCUMENT>Mapping Programming Models to Polaris Modules

The table below offers some suggestions for how to get started setting up your environment on Polaris depending on the programming language and model. Note, mixed C/C++ and Fortran applications should choose the programming environment for the Fortran compiler because of mpi.mod and similar incompatibilities between Fortran-generated files from different compilers. Several simple examples for testing the software environment on Polaris for different programming models are available in the ALCF GettingStart repo.

Note, users are encouraged to use PrgEnv-nvhpc instead of PrgEnv-nvidia as the latter will soon be deprecated in Cray's PE. They are otherwise identical pointing to compilers from the same NVIDIA SDK version.

<DOCUMENT>Kokkos

Kokkos

Kokkos Core implements a programming model in C++ for writing performance
portable applications targeting all major HPC platforms. For that purpose it
provides abstractions for both parallel execution of code and data
management. Kokkos is designed to target complex node architectures with
N-level memory hierarchies and multiple types of execution resources. It
currently can use Serial and OpenMP (threads) for CPU execution spaces
(""backends"") and CUDA, HIP, SYCL, and OpenMPTarget for GPU execution
spaces. By convention, Kokkos only allows one GPU backend at a time.

Kokkos on Polaris

Following the Polaris upgrade to HPCM
1.10,
the module setup to use the prebuilt Kokkos changed.

The prebuilt Kokkos on polaris includes 3 backends: Serial and OpenMP for CPU
execution and CUDA for GPU execution. To use it, run

module load craype-x86-milan
module load craype-accel-nvidia80
module swap PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-gnu
module use /soft/modulefiles
module load cuda-PrgEnv-nvidia/12.2.91
module load kokkos

This sets the following environment variables, some of which are used by
cmake:

KOKKOS_HOME - path to the lib64/, include/ files installed

LIBRARY_PATH - prepends $KOKKOS_HOME/lib64 to this variable used by cmake

CPATH - prepends $KOKKOS_HOME/include to this variable used by cmake

LD_LIBRARY_PATH - prepends $KOKKOS_HOME/lib64 to this variable

Building a Kokkos Application Using cmake

Add these lines to CMakeLists.txt:

find_package(Kokkos REQUIRED)

Introduction

CUDA-GDB is the NVIDIA tool for debugging CUDA applications running on Polaris. CUDA-GDB is an extension to GDB, the GNU Project debugger. The tool provides developers with a mechanism for debugging CUDA applications running on actual hardware. This enables developers to debug applications without the potential variations introduced by simulation and emulation environments.

Step-by-step guide

Debug Compilation

NVCC, the NVIDIA CUDA compiler driver, provides a mechanism for generating the debugging information necessary for CUDA-GDB to work properly. The -g -G option pair must be passed to NVCC when an application is compiled for ease of debugging with CUDA-GDB; for example,
nvcc -g -G foo.cu -o foo
Using this line to compile the CUDA application foo.cu
* forces -O0 compilation, with the exception of very limited dead-code eliminations and register-spilling optimizations.
* makes the compiler include debug information in the executable

Running CUDA-gdb on Polaris compute nodes

Start an interactive job mode on Polaris as follows:

```
$ qsub -I -l select=1 -l walltime=1:00:00

$ cuda-gdb --version

<DOCUMENT>Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) mode

MIG mode can be enabled and configured on Polaris by passing a valid configuration file to qsub:

qsub ... -l mig_config=/home/ME/path/to/mig_config.json ...

You can find a concise explanation of MIG concepts and terms at https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/tesla/mig-user-guide/index.html#concepts

Configuration

Please study the following example of a valid configuration file:

shell
{
  ""group1"": {
    ""gpus"": [0,1],
    ""mig_enabled"": true,
    ""instances"": {""7g.40gb"": [""4c.7g.40gb"", ""3c.7g.40gb""] }
  },
  ""group2"": {
    ""gpus"": [2,3],
    ""mig_enabled"": true,
    ""instances"": {""3g.20gb"": [""2c.3g.20gb"", ""1c.3g.20gb""], ""2g.10gb"": [""2g.10gb""], ""1g.5gb"": [""1g.5gb""], ""1g.5gb"": [""1g.5gb""]}
  }
}

Notes

Group names are arbitrary, but must be unique

""gpus"" must be an array of integers.  if only one physical gpu is being configured in a group, it must still be contained within an array(ex. ""gpus"": [0],)

Only groups with mig_enabled set to true will be configured

instances denote the MIG gpu instances and the nested compute instances you wish to be configured

syntax is {""gpu instance 1"": [""cpu instance 1"", ""cpu instance 2""], ...}

valid gpu instances are 1g.5gb, 1g.10gb, 2g.10gb, 3g.20gb, 4g.20gb, and 7g.40gb.  the first number denotes the number of slots used out of 7 total, and the second number denotes memory in GB

the default cpu instance for any gpu instance has the same identifier as the gpu instance(in which case it will be the only one configurable)

other cpu instances can be configured with the identifier syntax Xc.Y, where X is the number of slots available in that gpu instance, and Y is the gpu instance identifier string

some gpu instances cannot be configured adjacently, despite there being sufficient slots/memory remaining(ex. 3g.20gb and 4g.20gb). Please see NVIDIA MIG documentation for further details</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Compile and Run

For further details regarding the arguments passed to mpiexec command shown above, please visit the Job Scheduling and Execution section. A simple example describing the details and execution of the set_affinity_gpu_polaris.sh file can be found here.

Note: By default, there is no GPU-aware MPI library linking support.  The example above shows how the user can enable the linking by specifying the path to the GTL (GPU Transport Layer) library (libmpi_gtl_cuda) to the link line.

oneAPI Math Kernel Library (oneMKL) Interfaces

oneMKL Interfaces is an open-source implementation of the oneMKL Data Parallel C++ (DPC++) interface according to the oneMKL specification. It works with multiple devices (backends) using device-specific libraries underneath.

oneMKL is part of oneAPI. Various backend supported are shown below. More Information here.

User Application Third-Party Library cuBLAS oneMKL interface cuSOLVER cuRAND

Example (using onemkl::gemm)

The following snippet shows how to compile and run a SYCL code with oneMKL library. For instance, a GPU-based GEMM is performed using mkl::gemm API and the results are compared to a CPU-based GEMM performed using the traditional blas (e.g., AOCL-BLIS) library.
```c++

  bool MismatchFound = false;</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Set the environment variable NCCL_COLLNET_ENABLE=1

Set the environment varialbe NCCL_NET_GDR_LEVEL=PHB

Manually set the CPU affinity via mpiexec, such as with --cpu-bind verbose,list:0,8,16,24

Horovod works best when you limit the visible devices to only one GPU.  Note that if you import mpi4py or horovod, and then do something like os.environ[""CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES""] = hvd.local_rank(), it may not actually work!  You must set the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable prior to doing MPI.COMM_WORLD.init(), which is done in horovod.init() as well as implicitly in from mpi4py import MPI.   On Polaris specifically, you can use the environment variable PMI_LOCAL_RANK (as well as PMI_LOCAL_SIZE) to learn information about the node-local MPI ranks.

Notes</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Python

We provide prebuilt conda environments containing GPU-supported builds of
torch, tensorflow (both with horovod support for multi-node
calculations), jax, and many other commonly-used Python modules.

Users can activate this environment by first loading the conda module, and
then activating the base environment.

Explicitly (either from an interactive job, or inside a job script):

bash
module use /soft/modulefiles; module load conda ; conda activate base

This will load and activate the base environment.

Virtual environments via venv

To install additional packages that are missing from the base environment,
we can build a venv on top of it.

!!! success ""Conda base environment + venv""

You can always retroactively change the #!bash --system-site-packages flag
state for this virtual environment by editing #!bash ${VENV_DIR}/pyvenv.cfg and
changing the value of the line #!bash include-system-site-packages=false.

To install a different version of a package that is already installed in the
base environment, you can use:

bash
python3 pip install --ignore-installed <package> # or -I

The shared base environment is not writable, so it is impossible to remove or
uninstall packages from it. The packages installed with the above pip command
should shadow those installed in the base environment.

Cloning the base Anaconda environment

!!! warning

If you need more flexibility, you can clone the conda environment into a custom
path, which would then allow for root-like installations via #!bash conda install
<module> or #!bash pip install <module>.

Unlike the venv approach, using a cloned Anaconda environment requires you to
copy the entirety of the base environment, which can use significant storage
space.

To clone the base environment:

bash
module load conda ; conda activate base
conda create --clone base --prefix /path/to/envs/base-clone
conda activate /path/to/envs/base-clone

where, #!bash path/to/envs/base-clone should be replaced by a suitably chosen
path.</DOCUMENT>

Login nodes

There are four login nodes available to users for editing code, building code, submitting / monitoring jobs, checking usage (sbank), etc..  Their full hostnames are polaris-login-N.hsn.cm.polaris.alcf.anl.gov  for N equal to 01 through 04; there are an additional two login nodes that are not user-accessible which are used for running services such as JupyterHub.

NVIDIA CUDA-GDB Documentation

Introduction

CUDA-GDB is the NVIDIA tool for debugging CUDA applications running on Polaris. CUDA-GDB is an extension to GDB, the GNU Project debugger. The tool provides developers with a mechanism for debugging CUDA applications running on actual hardware. This enables developers to debug applications without the potential variations introduced by simulation and emulation environments.

Step-by-step guide

Debug Compilation

NVCC, the NVIDIA CUDA compiler driver, provides a mechanism for generating the debugging information necessary for CUDA-GDB to work properly. The -g -G option pair must be passed to NVCC when an application is compiled for ease of debugging with CUDA-GDB; for example,
nvcc -g -G foo.cu -o foo
Using this line to compile the CUDA application foo.cu
* forces -O0 compilation, with the exception of very limited dead-code eliminations and register-spilling optimizations.
* makes the compiler include debug information in the executable

Running CUDA-gdb on Polaris compute nodes

Start an interactive job mode on Polaris as follows:

```
$ qsub -I -l select=1 -l walltime=1:00:00

$ cuda-gdb --version

export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=$gpu
echo “RANK= ${PMI_RANK} LOCAL_RANK= ${PMI_LOCAL_RANK} gpu= ${gpu}”
exec ""$@""
This script can be placed just before the executable in the `mpiexec` command like so.bash
mpiexec -n ${NTOTRANKS} --ppn ${NRANKS_PER_NODE} --depth=${NDEPTH} --cpu-bind depth ./set_affinity_gpu_polaris.sh ./hello_affinity
```
Users with different needs, such as assigning multiple GPUs per MPI rank, can modify the above script to suit their needs.

Interactive Jobs on Compute Nodes

Here is how to submit an interactive job to, for example, edit/build/test an application Polaris compute nodes:
qsub -I -l select=1 -l filesystems=home:eagle -l walltime=1:00:00 -q debug -A <project_name>

This command requests 1 node for a period of 1 hour in the debug queue, requiring access to the /home and eagle filesystems. After waiting in the queue for a node to become available, a shell prompt on a compute node will appear. You may then start building applications and testing gpu affinity scripts on the compute node.

NOTE: If you want to ssh or scp to one of your assigned compute nodes you will need to make sure your $HOME directory and your $HOME/.ssh directory permissions are both set to 700.

Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for
technical computing. It has a syntax familiar to users of many other
technical computing environments. Designed at MIT to tackle large-scale
partial-differential equation simulation and distributed linear algebra, Julia
features a robust ecosystem of tools for
optimization,
statistics, parallel programming, and data
visualization. Julia is actively developed by the Julia
Labs team at MIT and in
industry, along with hundreds of domain-expert
scientists and programmers worldwide.

This guide is a first draft of the Julia documentation for Polaris. If you have any
suggestions or contributions, please open a pull request or contact us by
opening a ticket at the ALCF Helpdesk.

Julia Installation

We encourage users interested in using Julia on Polaris to install in their home or project directories at this time. Using the official Julia 1.9 binaries from the Julia
webpage is recommended.
Juliaup provides a convenient way to
install Julia and manage the various Julia versions. The default installation will install julia, juliaup, and other commands in a ${HOME}/.julia directory and update profile files like .bashrc to update PATH to include that directory. One can customize the installation to change these defaults.

bash
module load craype-accel-nvidia80
curl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh

If you chose a custom installation, then be sure to update the PATH environment variable appropriately.

export PATH=${HOME}/.juliaup/bin:${PATH}

You may then list the available Julia versions with juliaup list and install a
specific version with juliaup install <version>. You can then activate a
specific version with juliaup use <version> and set the default version with
juliaup default <version>. juliaup update will update the installed Julia
versions. In general, the latest stable release of Julia should be used.

bash
juliaup add release

<DOCUMENT>Manually launching a ParaView server on Polaris

Sometimes it is convenient to manually launch an instance of the ParaView server. In this section we will explain an alternative method to run the ParaView server on Polaris using an interactive job, where the user can launch the ParaView server from the command line interface.

Note: this is a method better suited for experienced users. If you are just starting with ParaView, we recommend the client/server mode as your primary method for using this tool.

Setting up ParaView

From your local client select Connect, either from the File menu, or by clicking on the icon circled below:

A new window will open where you can configure a server. Click on Add Server:

Give your server a name, select Client/Server, localhost, and a TCP port (8000 in this example)

Click ""Configure"". In the next window there is an option to set up how ParaView server will be launched, and the default is ""Manual"". Leave it on ""Manual"" and click ""Save"".

You will use these settings when establishing the connection.

Launching the ParaView server on Polaris

You can launch an interactive session on Polaris compute nodes with the following command (adjust parameters as needed to match your allocation, desired number of nodes, queue, walltime, and filesystems):

shell
qsub -l walltime=01:00:00 -l select=2 -A yourallocation -q debug -I -l filesystems=home:grand

When the job starts you will receive a prompt on your head node like this:

username@x3005c0s7b0n0:~>

Make a note of the node hostname (x3005c0s7b0n0 in the example above). You can also get this information from qstat -fx jobID

Now load the ParaView module

username@x3005c0s7b0n0:~> module use /soft/modulefiles 
username@x3005c0s7b0n0:~> module load visualization/paraview/paraview-5.12.0-EGL

and launch the ParaView server with</DOCUMENT>

Login nodes

There are four login nodes available to users for editing code, building code, submitting / monitoring jobs, checking usage (sbank), etc..  Their full hostnames are polaris-login-N.hsn.cm.polaris.alcf.anl.gov  for N equal to 01 through 04; there are an additional two login nodes that are not user-accessible which are used for running services such as JupyterHub. The various compilers and libraries are present on the logins, so most users should be able to build their code.  However, if your build requires the physical presence of the GPU, you will need to build on a compute node.

All users share the same login nodes so please be courteous and respectful of your fellow users.  For example, please do not run computationally or IO intensive pre- or post-processing on the logins and keep the parallelism of your builds to a reasonable level.

Queues

There are five production queues you can target in your qsub (-q <queue name>):

Queue Name Node Min Node Max Time Min Time Max Notes debug 1 2 5 min 1 hr max 24 nodes in use by this queue ay any given time; Only 8 nodes are exclusive (see Note below) debug-scaling 1 10 5 min 1 hr max 1 job running/accruing/queued per-user prod 10 496 5 min 24 hrs Routing queue; See below preemptable 1 10 5 min 72 hrs Please be aware that jobs in the preemptable queue can be killed at any time if jobs are submitted to the demand queue. Max 20 jobs running/accruing/queued per-project ; see Note below demand 1 56 5 min 1 hr By request only ; max 100 jobs running/accruing/queued per-project

Note: Please be aware that jobs in the preemptable queue can be killed at any time if jobs are submitted to the demand queue.
Jobs in the demand queue take priority over jobs in the preemptable queue.
This means jobs in the preemptable queue may be preempted (killed without any warning) if there are jobs in the demand queue.
Unfortunately, there's always an inherent risk of jobs being killed when using the preemptable queue. 
Please use the following command to view details of a queue: qstat -Qf <queuename>

To make your job re-runable add the following PBS directive: #PBS -r y This will ensure your job will restart once the demand job is complete.

Note: The debug queue has 8 exclusively dedicated nodes.
If there are free nodes in production, then debug jobs can take another 16 nodes for a total of 24.

prod is routing queue and routes your job to one of the following six execution queues:

You can look at the first lines of $KOKKOS_HOME/KokkosConfigCommon.cmake to

see the flags used in cmake configuration of the kokkos library build. The

default Kokkos module on Polaris was built with PrgEnv-nvhpc and includes

Serial, OpenMP (threads) and CUDA backends. So you should have that

environment module loaded and include compiler flags for cuda and openmp:

Configuring Your Own Kokkos Build on Polaris

Here are recommended environment settings and configuration to build your own
kokkos libraries on Polaris:

Environment

To match what was done in the centrally-built kokkos associated with the
modules discussed above, use the programming environment
PrgEnv-gnu, and use the Cray wrapper CC as the C++ compiler. You'll also
need to explicitly load the Cuda toolkit version 12.2.91 as shown:</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Controlling Where Your Job Runs

If you wish to have your job run on specific nodes form your select like this: -l select=1:vnode=<node name1>+1:vnode=<node name2>... . Obviously, that gets tedious for large jobs.

If you want to control the location of a few nodes, for example 2 out of 64, but the rest don't matter, you can do something like this: -l select=1:vnode=<node name1>+1:vnode=<node name2>+62:system=foo

Every node has a PBS resource called tier0 with a rack identifier and tier1 with a dragonfly group identifieer.  If you want all your nodes grouped in a rack, you can add the group specifier -l select=8:system=foo,place=scatter:group=tier0.  If you wanted everything in the same dragonfly group, replace tier0 with tier1.  Note that you have to also explicitly specify the place when you use group.  If you wanted a specific rack or dragonfly group instead of any of them, you are back to the select: -l select 10:tier0=x3001-g0.

Network: Rack and Dragonfly Group Mappings

Racks contain (7) 6U chassis; each chassis has 2 nodes for 14 nodes per rack

The hostnames are of the form xRRPPc0sUUb[0|1]n0 where:
RR is the row {30, 31, 32}
PP is the position in the row {30 goes 1-16, 31 and 32 go 1-12}
c is chassis and is always 0
s stands for slot, but in this case is the RU in the rack and values are {1,7,13,19,25,31,37}
b is BMC controller and is 0 or 1 (each node has its own BMC)
n is node, but is always 0 since there is only one node per BMC

So, 16+12+12 = 40 racks * 14 nodes per rack = 560 nodes.

Note that in production group 9 (the last 4 racks) will be the designated on-demand racks

The management racks are x3000 and X3100 and are dragonfly group 10

The TDS rack is x3200 and is dragonfly group 11</DOCUMENT>

<DOCUMENT>Use TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.  Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.  When possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention.

Use XLA compilation on your code.  XLA is the Accelerated Linear Algebra library that is available in tensorFlow and critical in software like JAX.  XLA will compile a tf.Graph object, generated with tf.function or similar, and perform optimizations like operation-fusion.  XLA can give impressive performance boosts with almost no user changes except to set an environment variable TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2.  If your code is complex, or has dynamically sized tensors (tensors where the shape changes every iteration), XLA can be detrimental: the overhead for compiling functions can be large enough to mitigate performance improvements.  XLA is particularly powerful when combined with reduced precision, yielding speedups > 100% in some models.

Multi-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up

TensorFlow is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with tensorFlow has been seen with horovod in particular.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation.  Some polaris specific details that may be helpful to you:

CPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.  In particular, we encourage users to try their scaling measurements with the following settings:

<DOCUMENT>libEnsemble

libEnsemble is a Python toolkit for running dynamic ensembles of calculations.

Users provide generator and simulator functions to express their ensembles, where the generator can steer the ensemble based on previous results. These functions can portably submit external executables at any scale.

System details are detected, and dynamic resource management is provided. This includes automatically detecting, assigning, and reassigning
GPUs for ensemble members.

libEnsemble can be used in a consistent manner on laptops, clusters, and supercomputers with minimal required dependencies.

Getting libEnsemble on Polaris

libEnsemble is provided on Polaris in the conda module:

See the docs for more details on using python on Polaris.

libEnsemble examples

For a very simple example of using libEnsemble see the Simple Introduction tutorial

For an example that runs a small ensemble using a C application (offloading work to the GPU), see
the GPU app tutorial.
The required files for this tutorial can be found
in this directory.
A video demo is also available.

Job Submission

libEnsemble runs on the compute nodes on Polaris using either Python's
multiprocessing or mpi4py. The user can set the number of workers for
maximum concurrency. libEnsemble will detect the nodes available
from the PBS environment and use these for running simulations. Polaris supports
running multiple concurrent simulations on each node if desired.

A simple example batch script for a libEnsemble use case that runs five workers on one node:

```shell
    #!/bin/bash -l
    #PBS -l select=1:system=polaris
    #PBS -l walltime=00:15:00
    #PBS -l filesystems=home:grand

Balsam is a Python-based workflow manager that helps users execute large numbers of jobs, potentially with interjob dependencies, track job outcomes, and manage postprocessing analysis. A Balsam Site runs on a node with access to the job scheduler, where it can submit and monitor jobs. Overall job state is aggregated on the Balsam Server, making job data from all Sites accessible from any individual site (or the user's laptop), via the command-line interface or the Python API. To get information on how to use the command line tool, you can type balsam --help in your shell.

Full documentation for Balsam is available online.

Balsam requires Python 3.7+. To install Balsam on Polaris, first set up a virtual Python environment:

shell

Differences between nvcc and nvc/nvc++

For users that want to continue using nvcc it is important to be mindful of differences with the newer nvc and nvc++ compilers. For example, the -cuda flag instructs nvcc to compile .cu input files to .cu.cpp.ii output files which are to be separately compiled, whereas the same -cuda flag instructs nvc, nvc++, and nvfortran to enable CUDA C/C++ or CUDA Fortran code generation. The resulting output file in each case is different (text vs. object) and one may see unrecognized format error when -cuda is incorrectly passed to nvcc.

Known Issues and Workarounds

If you are using nvcc to invoke nvc++ and compiling C++17 code, and are seeing the following warning and unable to compile C++17 constructs:

```
polaris-login-01(~)> nvcc --std=c++17 -ccbin nvc++ ~/smalltests/bool_constant.cpp
nvcc warning : The -std=c++17 flag is not supported with the configured host compiler. Flag will be ignored.

<DOCUMENT>Spack PE

Spack is an HPC-oriented package manager which ALCF uses to install software for
the user environment.

ALCF's Spack PE is a Spack-managed software stack which provides various build
tools, utilities, and libraries. It consists of a base stack (spack-pe-base)
and PrgEnv-dependent stacks (currently spack-pe-gnu).

spack-pe-base contains commonplace software compiled for CPU with the system
GCC compilers. Accordingly, the software in spack-pe-base can be used
regardless of programming environment.

spack-pe-gnu is based on the E4S Project and
provides performant HPC libraries built with PrgEnv-gnu and the nvcc CUDA
compiler driver for GPU code. spack-pe-gnu is dependent on both
spack-pe-base and PrgEnv-gnu.

Using software from the Spack PE

The base suite of software tools and libraries can be accessed by loading the
spack-pe-base module. This adds a path to $MODULEPATH which contains
numerous modules.

For example, to load cmake starting from the default environment, a user
should run the following commands:
module use /soft/modulefiles
module load spack-pe-base
module load cmake

The spack-pe-base module adds paths to the user's MODULEPATH; individual packages are subsequently loaded through the newly available modules. The full list of available packages can be viewed by running module avail or module --show-hidden avail for a complete listing. Packages are loaded in the same way from spack-pe-gnu.

Inspecting packages

When a module in the Spack PE is loaded, several environment variables are
updated to integrate the package into the user's environment. Additionally, the
PACKAGE_ROOT variable is set to the path to the installation prefix of the

Context: <DOCUMENT>ParaView on Polaris

The recommended way of running ParaView on Polaris is in client/server mode. This consists of running the ParaView client on your local resource, and the ParaView server on the Polaris compute nodes. The ParaView client needs to first be installed on your local resource, and needs to match the version that you run on Polaris.

There are multiple versions of ParaView installed on Polaris. To find the versions of ParaView currently available on Polaris run the following command on a login node: 
module use /soft/modulefiles
module avail paraview

Binary and source packages of the ParaView client for Linux, MacOS, and Windows are available from the ParaView Download Page.

Connecting to the ParaView server on Polaris

This section describes how to launch the ParaView server on Polaris from a local ParaView client.

Start ParaView Client

First, launch the ParaView client on your local resource. You will need to configure some server settings in the client. This initial set up should only need to be done once, and can be reused each time you want to run ParaView on Polaris.

Server Configuration

1. Select Connect

From the ParaView client choose to connect to a server by either clicking on the ""Connect"" icon in the menu bar

or selecting File->Connect from the main menu

2. Set Up Servers (first time only)

The first time you want to run a server on Polaris and have it connect to your local ParaView client, you will need to set up a Server. Once this server is set up, you can reuse it each time you run the ParaView client with the ParaView server on Polaris.

Kitware, the developers of ParaView, maintain a database of server configurations which you can retrieve through the ParaView client. In the File->Connect menu press the button named ""Fetch Servers"" and select POLARIS@ANL. Windows users should select ""windows to POLARIS@ANL"". Press ""Import Selected""

3. Use ParaView</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>QMCPACK on Polaris

QMCPACK, is a modern high-performance open-source Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation code. Its main applications are electronic structure calculations of molecular, quasi-2D and solid-state systems. Variational Monte Carlo (VMC), diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) and a number of other advanced QMC algorithms are implemented. Orbital space auxiliary field QMC (AFQMC) has recently been added. By directly solving the Schrodinger equation, QMC methods offer greater accuracy than methods such as density functional theory, but at a trade-off of much greater computational expense.

Prebuilt executables are provided at /soft/applications/qmcpack.
The directory of each installation also includes a job submission script example qmcpack-polaris.job.
Update build recipe is provided on GitHub.</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Python

We provide prebuilt conda environments containing GPU-supported builds of
torch, tensorflow (both with horovod support for multi-node
calculations), jax, and many other commonly-used Python modules.

Users can activate this environment by first loading the conda module, and
then activating the base environment.

Explicitly (either from an interactive job, or inside a job script):

bash
module use /soft/modulefiles; module load conda ; conda activate base

This will load and activate the base environment.

Virtual environments via venv

To install additional packages that are missing from the base environment,
we can build a venv on top of it.

!!! success ""Conda base environment + venv""

You can always retroactively change the #!bash --system-site-packages flag
state for this virtual environment by editing #!bash ${VENV_DIR}/pyvenv.cfg and
changing the value of the line #!bash include-system-site-packages=false.

To install a different version of a package that is already installed in the
base environment, you can use:

bash
python3 pip install --ignore-installed <package> # or -I

The shared base environment is not writable, so it is impossible to remove or
uninstall packages from it. The packages installed with the above pip command
should shadow those installed in the base environment.

Cloning the base Anaconda environment

!!! warning

If you need more flexibility, you can clone the conda environment into a custom
path, which would then allow for root-like installations via #!bash conda install
<module> or #!bash pip install <module>.

Unlike the venv approach, using a cloned Anaconda environment requires you to
copy the entirety of the base environment, which can use significant storage
space.

To clone the base environment:

bash
module load conda ; conda activate base
conda create --clone base --prefix /path/to/envs/base-clone
conda activate /path/to/envs/base-clone

where, #!bash path/to/envs/base-clone should be replaced by a suitably chosen
path.</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>8. Data Representation: Opacity

Even with the continuum data represented as wireframe, there is still considerable occlusion of the interior structures. In order to further reduce this occlusion by the wireframe, we can make it more transparent.

Again, be sure that the continuum.000*data is selected in the Pipeline Browser

In the Object Inspector make sure the Display tab is selected

In the Object Inspector there is a section titled Style

Set Opacity to 0.2

9. Animating Simulation Data

Since our data has multiple time steps, we can easily animate through them to see how the data changes over time.

Simply click the Play button on the animation bar at the top of the GUI

Pause to make it stop

Loop: With this button toggled on, animation will repeat until stopped

10. Animations

Animations can be saved to disk as a movie file, to be played back later.

From the main menu: File->Save Animation

Animation Settings Dialog: Save Animation

Files of type: AVI files (*.avi)

Enter a name in File name:

Click OK

Movie can be played back with standard media players (Windows Media Player, QuickTime, VLC, etc.)

11. Particles as Glyphs

Glyphs are another way of visually representing data where the attributes of a graphical element are dictated by attributes of the data.

All of the particles are displayed as red points in the graphics window. There are ~39K particles in this particular data set, which makes the display a bit cluttered. In order to both filter some of these out, and create 3D representations for them, let's apply a glyph filter to this data.

Now let's add some of our other data back into the scene. Let's start with the particle data.

All of the particles are displayed as red points in the graphics window. There are ~39K particles in this particular data set, which makes the display rather cluttered. In order to both filter some of these out, and create 3D representations for them, we will apply the glyph filter to this data.</DOCUMENT>

Context: <DOCUMENT>Parsl on Polaris

Parsl is a flexible and scalable parallel programming library for Python.

-- Parsl Documentation

For many applications, managing an ensemble of jobs into a workflow is a critical step that can easily become a performance bottleneck.  Many tools exist to address this, of which parsl is just one.  On this page, we'll highlight some of the key pieces of information about parsl that are relevant to Polaris.  Parsl is also extensively documented, has a dedicated Slack Channel, and a large community of users and developers beyond ALCF.  We encourage you to engage with the parsl community for support with parsl specific questions, and for Polaris-specific questions or problems, please contact support@alcf.anl.gov.

Getting Parsl on Polaris

You can install parsl building off of the conda modules.  You have some flexibility in how you want to extend the conda module to include parsl, but here is an example way to do it:

```python

Load the Conda Module (needed everytime you use parsl)

module load conda
conda activate

Create a virtual env that uses the conda env as the system packages.

Only do the next line on initial set up:

python -m venv --system-site-packages /path/to/your/virtualenv

Load the virtual env (every time):

source /path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/activate

Install parsl (only once)

pip install parsl

```

Using Parsl on Polaris

Parsl has a variety of possible configuration settings.  As an example, we provide the configuration below that will run one task per GPU:

```python
from parsl.config import Config

PBSPro is the right provider for Polaris:

from parsl.providers import PBSProProvider

The high throughput executor is for scaling to HPC systems:

from parsl.executors import HighThroughputExecutor

You can use the MPI launcher, but may want the Gnu Parallel launcher, see below

from parsl.launchers import MpiExecLauncher, GnuParallelLauncher

address_by_interface is needed for the HighThroughputExecutor:</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>3. Use ParaView

After the previous step, you can now select POLARIS@ANL in the File->Connect menu and press Connect

At this point a new window will pop up

There are a number of parameters that you must enter manually here:

Xterm executable: the path of a terminal on your system. The figure shows the case of a Mac with XQuartz. You may need to change these values for Windows or Linux.

SSH executable: the name of your ssh command. It may be different on Windows depending on the ssh client installed (i.e putty)

Remote machine: leave this value at polaris.alcf.anl.gov

Username: your ALCF user name

ParaView version: the version of Paraview that you want to use. Verify first that this version is installed on the system (as described at the top of this document). You will also need to add a -EGL suffix.

Example:
5.12.0-EGL

Client port: it is safe to use the default value

Server port: is is safe to use the default value

Number of nodes to reserve: enter the number of Polaris compute nodes you want to use for your job

Number of ranks per node: enter the number of ranks per node

Number of minutes to reserve: the duration of your job in minutes

Account: enter here the name of your ALCF allocation

Queue: the name of the Polaris queue you would like to use (i.e: debug for small, quick jobs, prod, preemptable)

File Systems: enter here the file systems you need for your job, separated with colons, no spaces. Keep in mind that your job may not run if one of these file systems is not available at that time, so enter these values carefully

Job name: safe to use default value. The PBS scheduler will assign this name to your job

Now you can press OK to establish the connection with a ParaView server on Polaris.

An ssh connection will be established with a Polaris login node and a password will be requested in a terminal, similar to the process you normally use to connect and work on the system.</DOCUMENT>

<DOCUMENT>Mixed C/C++ & Fortran Applications

For applications consisting of a mix of C/C++ and Fortran that also uses MPI, it is suggested that the programming environment chosen for Fortran be used to build the full application because of mpi.mod (and similar) incompatibilities.

Compiling for GPUs

It is assumed the majority of applications to be built on Polaris will make use of the GPUs. As such, the craype-accel-nvidia80 module is in the default environment. This has the effect of the Cray compiler wrappers adding -gpu to the compiler invocation along with additional include paths and libraries. Additional compilers flags may be needed depending on the compiler and GPU programming model used (e.g. -cuda, -acc, or -mp=gpu).

This module also adds GPU Transport Layer (GTL) libraries to the link-line to support GPU-aware MPI applications.

Click the Apply button

Since our goal was to unclutter the display, let's hide the particles.000*by toggling them off, by clicking on the Eye icon next to it in the Pipeline Browser

Let's also switch to the Display tab in the Object Inspector, with Glyph1 selected, and change the Color by value to GlyphVector. Since the GlyphVector value is based on the velocity. We can Edit Color Map...and choose the same Blue to Red Rainbow preset that we previously chose for velocity

12. Enter: Red Blood Cells

Now let's add in both of the other data sets, which are polygonal meshes which make up Red Blood Cells (RBCs).

These two data sets are essentially the same kind of data, so we can apply the same filters and make the same types of representation changes to each of them. However, some of the RBCs are marked by the simulation that generated them as healthy (rbc.000) and some of them are marked as diseased (bad_rbc.000).

Unhide the rbc.000 and bad_rbc.000 data sets by clicking the Eye icon next to each of them to make them visible

13. Using Color to Differentiate Data

To enable us to distinguish these two types of data from one other, we can vary their representations.

One way to do this is by setting the color of the two data sets to different colors. Repeat this process for each of rbc.000 and bad_rbc.000, picking different colors.

<DOCUMENT>oneAPI Compilers and Support

The Intel oneAPI compiler and Codeplay plugins for Nvidia GPUs are available on Polaris.
The oneAPI compilers are not enabled under the Cray Programming Environment system but can be used separately.
Two oneAPI variants are provided, the first being a ""release"" version based on Intel's officially released oneAPI toolkit.
Intel Release Notes

Components

These are the list of components associated with this module

User Application Component Compilers DPC++ oneMKL Interfaces oneMKL

The other variant being a build from the open-source. This variant will be more up-to-date at the risk of bugs and breakages based on code that has not undergone a full release cycle.
The documentation is located on the SYCL page. Most notable differences being, icx/icpx are the names of C/C++ compilers respectively when using the release version of the module where as clang/clang++ are for open-source variant.

Compile and Link

oneAPI uses the clang (or icx/icpx wrapper) for compiling and linking for the Nvidia A100 SM80 architecture.

<DOCUMENT>Datascience Anaconda Module Updates

We have updated the datascience Anaconda module and built various packages and libraries with CUDA 12.4.1 to be compatible with 
the new Polaris NVIDIA GPU hardware driver (CUDA 12.2) and to use the latest MPI, NCCL, cuDNN, TensorRT, etc. libraries. 
PyTorch 2.3.0 and TensorFlow 2.16.1 are now available as part of this module.

To use the new environment, type:
module use /soft/modulefiles 
module load conda; conda activate

/soft refresh and default $MODULEPATH change

Due to the new system software stack, /soft has been purged to allow for
software to be rebuilt. In addition, /soft/modulefiles is no longer in the
default $MODULEPATH. To access modules installed in /soft, users should run
module use /soft/modulefiles.

Adding module use /soft/modulefiles to your profile should approximate the old behavior.

Modules removed

The following modules have been removed:</DOCUMENT>

When running on the login node, switch back to the default provided MPI binaries inMPI_jll.jl

by removing theLocalPreferences.toml` file.

GPU Support

NVIDIA GPU support is provided through the CUDA.jl package. The default in Julia is to download artifacts (e.g. CUDA toolkit) based on the runtime detected. While that should generally work, it is recommended to use the local CUDA installation provided on Polaris especially if using gpu-aware MPI in your workloads (important to use supported versions of CUDA with Cray MPICH provided).

To use the local CUDA installation provided by the modules on Polaris, the LocalPreferences.toml file can be modified as follows.

$ head $JULIA_DEPOT_PATH/environments/v1.10/LocalPreferences.toml
[CUDA_Runtime_jll]
local = true

If using the default PrgEnv-nvhpc module on Polaris, then it will be necessary to correct a path to the CUPTI library to successfully install CUDA.jl.

$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$CRAY_NVIDIA_PREFIX/cuda/12.2/extras/CUPTI/lib64/
$ julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(""CUDA"")'

The GPUs are not currently usable on the Polaris login nodes, so one can confirm the version of CUDA being used by testing in a batch or interactive job on a compute node.

If the application instead relies on the job launcher to bind MPI ranks to available GPUs, then a small helper script can be used to explicitly setCUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` appropriately for each MPI rank. One example is available here where each MPI rank is similarly bound to a single GPU with round-robin assignment. The binding of MPI ranks to GPUs is discussed in more detail here.

GPU OpenCL

A simple OpenCL example is available here. The OpenCL headers and library are available in the NVHPC SDK and cuda toolkits. The environment variable NVIDIA_PATH is defined for the PrgEnv-nvhpc programming environment. 
CC -o vecadd -g -O3 -std=c++0x  -I${NVIDIA_PATH}/cuda/include main.o -L${NVIDIA_PATH}/cuda/lib64 -lOpenCL

This simple example can be run on a Polaris compute node as follows.
```
$ ./vecadd
Running on GPU!
Using single-precision

Result is CORRECT!! :)
```

GPU OpenMP

A simple MPI-parallel OpenMP example is available here. Compilation proceeds similar to the above examples except for use of the -mp=gpu compiler flag to indicated compilation of OpenMP code for GPUs.

CC -g -O3 -std=c++0x -mp=gpu -gpu=cc80,cuda11.0 -c main.cpp -o vecadd

Similar to the OpenACC example above, this code binds MPI ranks to GPUs in a round-robin fashion. 
```
$ mpiexec -n 4 ./vecadd

of devices= 4

Rank 0 running on GPU 0!
Rank 1 running on GPU 1!
Rank 2 running on GPU 2!
Rank 3 running on GPU 3!

Result is CORRECT!! :)

<DOCUMENT>ParaView and Visit

ParaView module has been updated. For more information, see https://docs.alcf.anl.gov/polaris/visualization/paraview/ and https://docs.alcf.anl.gov/polaris/visualization/paraview-manual-launch/

Visit module is in the process of being updated.

Changes to Memory Limits on Login Nodes

Memory limits were lowered on the logins due to resource contention to 8GB of memory, and 8 cores per user. 
This might result in error messages indicating abnormal process termination for user processes run on logins.

Examples of the error messages people might see are:

nvcc error   : 'cudafe++' died due to signal 9 (Kill signal)

g++-12: fatal error: Killed signal terminated program cc1plus

These errors are likely due to exhausting the per-user resources on a login node as each user is allocated 8 cores and 8GB memory.
To avoid this you can either:

Reduce the parallelism of your compile, such as using -j or -j4 flags

Request a debug node and run your compile there where you will have the full resources of the node at your disposal</DOCUMENT>

Introduction

NVIDIA® Nsight™ Systems provides developers a system-wide visualization of an applications performance. Developers can optimize bottlenecks to scale efficiently across any number or size of CPUs and GPUs on Polaris. For further optimizations to compute kernels developers should use Nsight Compute.

The NVIDIA Nsight Compute is an interactive kernel profiler for CUDA applications. It provides detailed performance metrics and API debugging via a user interface and command line tool.

In addition, the baseline feature of this tool allows users to compare results within the tool. NVIDIA Nsight Compute provides a customizable and data-driven user interface,  metric collection, and can be extended with analysis scripts for post-processing results.

<DOCUMENT>2. Select which data to view

Let's start by looking at the continuum.000*data. This is an unstructured mesh that has velocity and count (density) values.
- Hide other data sets using the Eyeball icon next their names in the Pipeline Browser.
  - Black = visible, Grey = hidden
- Select continuum.000*(name is highlighted) in the Pipeline Browser
  - Click on the name to highlight it
- When manipulating appearance or applying filters, these always affect the selected data set
- Switch to the Display tab in the Object Inspector
- Under Color by, select Velocity from the dropdown
  - There is also a shortcut to Color by in the menu bar near the top of the GUI
  -

3. Manipulating the Color Map

To change the colors used to represent the Velocity:
- Under Color byclick the Edit Color Map... button
- On the Color Scale Editor window click the Choose Preset button
- On the Preset Color Scales window, select: Blue to Red Rainbow, and click OK. Then click Close on the Color Scale Editor window
- You can also create and save your own color maps

4. Data Representation

In order to be able to see the particles and red blood cells inside the cylinder, we need to be able to see through it. If we scroll down a bit in the Object Inspector view:
- Group of controls labeled Style
- In the Representation dropdown, select Wireframe

5. Generate Streamlines

ParaView enables the generation of different types of data from existing data sets in the Pipeline

Streamlines: Generated from vectors of the flow field. These curves show the direction a fluid element will travel in at any point in time

Make sure that the continuum.000*data is selected in the Pipeline Browser

From the main menu select: Filters->Alphabetical->Stream Tracer, or click on the Stream Tracer icon from the menu bar

In the Object Inspector make sure the Properties tab is selected.

Scroll down to seeds, and change Seed Type to Line Source

Click the Y Axis button to set the seed line to run along the Y axis.</DOCUMENT>

User: What is the purpose of selecting the 'Wireframe' representation in the Style group of controls?
Assistant: The purpose is to allow visualization of internal structures.

Horovod works best when you limit the visible devices to only one GPU.  Note that if you import mpi4py or horovod, and then do something like os.environ[""CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES""] = hvd.local_rank(), it may not actually work!  You must set the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable prior to doing MPI.COMM_WORLD.init(), which is done in horovod.init() as well as implicitly in from mpi4py import MPI.   On Polaris specifically, you can use the environment variable PMI_LOCAL_RANK (as well as PMI_LOCAL_SIZE) to learn information about the node-local MPI ranks.

<DOCUMENT>Compilers provided by Cray Programming Environments

The default programming environment on Polaris is currently NVHPC. The GNU compilers are available via another programming environment. The following sequence of module commands can be used to switch to the GNU programming environment (gcc, g++, gfortran) and also have NVIDIA compilers available in your path.

module swap PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-gnu
module load nvhpc-mixed

The compilers invoked by the Cray MPI wrappers are listed for each programming environment in the following table.

module C C++ Fortran MPI Compiler Wrapper cc CC ftn PrgEnv-nvhpc nvc nvc++ nvfortran PrgEnv-gnu gcc g++ gfortran

Note, while gcc and g++ may be available in the default environment, the PrgEnv-gnu module is needed to provide gfortran.

Additional Compilers Provided by ALCF

The ALCF additionally provides compilers to enable the OpenMP and SYCL programming models for GPUs viaLLVM as documented here

Additional documentation for using compilers is available on the respective programming model pages: OpenMP and SYCL.

Linking

Dynamic linking of libraries is currently the default on Polaris. The Cray MPI wrappers will handle this automatically.

Notes on Default Modules

craype-x86-rome: While the Polaris compute nodes currently have Milan CPUs, this module is loaded by default to avoid the craype-x86-milan module from adding a zen3 target not supported in the default nvhpc/21.9 compilers. The craype-x86-milan module is expected to be made default once a newer nvhpc version (e.g. 22.5) is made the default.

craype-accel-nvidia80: This module adds compiler flags to enable GPU acceleration for NVHPC compilers along with gpu-enabled MPI libraries as it is assumed that the majority of applications to be compiled on Polaris will target the GPUs for acceleration. Users building cpu-only applications may find it useful to unload this module to silence ""gpu code generation"" warnings.

Context: <DOCUMENT>Example Programs and Makefiles for Polaris

Several simple examples of building CPU and GPU-enabled codes on Polaris are available in the ALCF GettingStart repo for several programming models. If build your application is problematic for some reason (e.g. absence of a GPU), then users are encouraged to build and test applications directly on one of the Polaris compute nodes via an interactive job. The discussion below makes use of the NVHPC compilers in the default environment as illustrative examples. Similar examples for other compilers on Polaris are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo.

CPU MPI+OpenMP Example

One of the first useful tasks with any new machine, scheduler, and job launcher is to ensure one is binding MPI ranks and OpenMP threads to the host cpu as intended. A simple HelloWorld MPI+OpenMP example is available here to get started with.

The application can be straightforwardly compiled using the Cray compiler wrappers.
CC -fopenmp main.cpp -o hello_affinity

The executable hello_affinity can then be launched in a job script (or directly in shell of interactive job) using mpiexec as discussed here.

CUDA

Several variants of C/C++ and Fortran CUDA examples are available here that include MPI and multi-gpu examples.

One can use the Cray compiler wrappers to compile GPU-enabled applications as well. This example of simple vector addition uses the NVIDIA compilers.

<DOCUMENT>LAMMPS

Overview

LAMMPS is a general-purpose molecular dynamics software package for massively parallel computers. It is written in an exceptionally clean style that makes it one of the more popular codes for users to extend and it currently has dozens of user-developed extensions.

For details about the code and its usage, see the LAMMPS home page. This page provides information specific to running on Polaris at the ALCF.

Using LAMMPS at ALCF

ALCF provides assistance with build instructions, compiling executables, submitting jobs, and providing prebuilt binaries (upon request). A collection of Makefiles and submission scripts are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo here. For questions, contact us at support@alcf.anl.gov.

How to Obtain the Code

LAMMPS is an open-source code, which can be downloaded from the LAMMPS website.

Building on Polaris

After LAMMPS has been downloaded and unpacked on an ALCF filesystem, users should see a directory whose name is of the form lammps-<version>. One should then see the Makefile lammps-<version>/src/MAKE/MACHINES/Makefile.polaris in recent versions that can be used as a starting point for compilation on Polaris. Copies of Makefiles for building with the GPU/KOKKOS package using CUDA for GPU support with the GNU/NVHPC compiler are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo here. For older versions of LAMMPS, you may need to take an existing Makefile (e.g. Makefile.mpi) for your specific version of LAMMPS and edit the top portion appropratiately to create a new Makefile.polaris.

KOKKOS package and GNU compilers

The following modules are useful for this particular build. Note, the cmake module is not required if using the GNU Makefile procedure to build LAMMPS. The initial module restore is just setting the default environment as the starting point. Users may find it useful to copy these module commands into a small helper script to assist with compiling and running LAMMPS (e.g. setup_lammps_gnu.sh).</DOCUMENT>

<DOCUMENT>2. Select which data to view

Let's start by looking at the continuum.000*data. This is an unstructured mesh that has velocity and count (density) values.
- Hide other data sets using the Eyeball icon next their names in the Pipeline Browser.
  - Black = visible, Grey = hidden
- Select continuum.000*(name is highlighted) in the Pipeline Browser
  - Click on the name to highlight it
- When manipulating appearance or applying filters, these always affect the selected data set
- Switch to the Display tab in the Object Inspector
- Under Color by, select Velocity from the dropdown
  - There is also a shortcut to Color by in the menu bar near the top of the GUI
  -

3. Manipulating the Color Map

To change the colors used to represent the Velocity:
- Under Color byclick the Edit Color Map... button
- On the Color Scale Editor window click the Choose Preset button
- On the Preset Color Scales window, select: Blue to Red Rainbow, and click OK. Then click Close on the Color Scale Editor window
- You can also create and save your own color maps

4. Data Representation

In order to be able to see the particles and red blood cells inside the cylinder, we need to be able to see through it. If we scroll down a bit in the Object Inspector view:
- Group of controls labeled Style
- In the Representation dropdown, select Wireframe

5. Generate Streamlines

ParaView enables the generation of different types of data from existing data sets in the Pipeline

Streamlines: Generated from vectors of the flow field. These curves show the direction a fluid element will travel in at any point in time

Make sure that the continuum.000*data is selected in the Pipeline Browser

From the main menu select: Filters->Alphabetical->Stream Tracer, or click on the Stream Tracer icon from the menu bar

In the Object Inspector make sure the Properties tab is selected.

Scroll down to seeds, and change Seed Type to Line Source

Click the Y Axis button to set the seed line to run along the Y axis.</DOCUMENT>

User: What type of data can be generated from existing data sets using ParaView's Stream Tracer filter?
Assistant: Streamlines.

Context: <DOCUMENT>Click the Y Axis button to set the seed line to run along the Y axis.

The default Resolution is set to 100. This will make things a bit cluttered, especially when we start adding in the other data, so let's reduce this to 25

Click the Apply button

6. Streamlines as Tubes

The streamlines are just that, lines. We can use the Tubes filter to represent them as 3D objects, rather than just lines.
- With StreamTracer1selected in the Pipeline Browser, from the main menu select: Filters->Alphabetical->Tube
- In the Object Inspector make sure the Properties tab is selected
- The default value for the Radius is a bit too large for this data, let's set that value to 0
- Click the Apply button
- Notice that the StreamLine1 object has automatically been hidden
- There are many different ways to color these tubes
- With Tubes1 selected, switch to the Display tab in the Object Inspector
- The Color bydropdown lets you choose from a handful of different variables

7. Cutting Planes (Slices)

Now let's add some cutting plans, or slices, to see what the cross-section of the continuum data looks like.
- Again, be sure that the continuum.000*data is selected in the Pipeline Browser
- Filters->Alphabetical->Slice or Click on the Slice icon from the menu bar
- In the Object Inspector make sure the Propertiestab is selected
- At the bottom on the Object Inspector is a section titled Slice Offset Values. Here we can generate values for multiple slices to be made
- First click the Delete All button to remove initial values
- Next, click the New Range button. This will bring up an Add Range dialog box.
- Set the number of Steps to 7. Click OK
- Click the Apply button
- With Slice1 selected in the Object Inspector, switch to the Display tab
- Set Color by value to Velocity

8. Data Representation: Opacity</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>CC -g -O3 -std=c++0x -cuda main.cpp -o vecadd

The craype-accel-nvidia80 module in the default environment will add the -gpu compiler flag for nvhpc compilers along with appropriate include directories and libraries. It is left to the user to provide an additional flag to the nvhpc compilers to select the target GPU programming model. In this case, -cuda is used to indicate compilation of CUDA code. The application can then be launched within a batch job submission script or as follows on one of the compute nodes.

```
$ ./vecadd

GPU OpenACC

A simple MPI-parallel OpenACC example is available here. Compilation proceeds similar to the above CUDA example except for the use of the -acc=gpu compiler flag to indicate compilation of OpenACC code for GPUs.
CC -g -O3 -std=c++0x -acc=gpu -gpu=cc80,cuda11.0 main.cpp -o vecadd
In this example, each MPI rank sees all four GPUs on a Polaris node and GPUs are bound to MPI ranks round-robin within the application.

<DOCUMENT>mpi4Jax is a relatively new project and requires setting some environment variables for good performance and usability:
- Set MPI4JAX_USE_CUDA_MPI=1 to use CUDA-Aware MPI, supported in the conda module, to do operations directly from the GPU.
- Set MPICH_GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED=1 to use CUDA-Aware MPI.

The following code, based off of a test script from the mpi4jax repository, can help you verify you are using mpi4jax properly:

```python

import jax.numpy as jnp
import mpi4jax

comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD
rank = comm.Get_rank()
local_rank = int(os.environ[""PMI_LOCAL_RANK""])

available_devices = jax.devices(""gpu"")
if len(available_devices) <= local_rank:
    raise Exception(""Could not find enough GPUs"")

target_device = available_devices[local_rank]

@jax.jit
def foo(arr):
   arr = arr + rank
   arr_sum, _ = mpi4jax.allreduce(arr, op=MPI.SUM, comm=comm)
   return arr_sum

with jax.default_device(target_device):
    a = jnp.zeros((3, 3))
    print(f""Rank {rank}, local rank {local_rank}, a.device is {a.device()}"")
    result = foo(a)
    print(f""Rank {rank}, local rank {local_rank}, result.device is {result.device()}"")

if rank == 0:
   print(result)

Context: <DOCUMENT>PyTorch on Polaris

PyTorch is a popular, open source deep learning framework developed and released by Facebook.  The PyTorch home page has more information about PyTorch, which you can refer to.  For trouble shooting on Polaris, please contact support@alcf.anl.gov.

Installation on Polaris

PyTorch is installed on Polaris already, available in the conda module.  To use it from a compute node, please do:

bash
module load conda
conda activate

Then, you can load PyTorch in python as usual (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):

```python

import torch
torch.version
'1.12.0a0+git67ece03'

```

This installation of PyTorch was built from source and the cuda libraries it uses are found via the CUDA_HOME environment variable (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):

bash
$ echo $CUDA_HOME
/soft/datascience/cuda/cuda_11.5.2_495.29.05_linux

If you need to build applications that use this version of PyTorch and CUDA, we recommend using these cuda libraries to ensure compatibility.  We periodically update the PyTorch release, though updates will come in the form of new versions of the conda module.

PyTorch is also available through nvidia containers that have been translated to Singularity containers.  For more information about containers, please see the containers documentation page.

PyTorch Best Practices on Polaris

<DOCUMENT>SmartSim and SmartRedis

SmartSim is an open source tool developed by the Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) designed to facilitate the integration of traditional HPC simulation applications with machine learning workflows.
There are two core components to SmartSim:

Infrastructure library (IL)
Provides API to start, stop and monitor HPC applications from Python
Interfaces with the scheduler launch jobs (PBSPro on Polaris and Cobalt on Theta/ThetaGPU)
Deploys a distributed in-memory database called the Orchestrator

SmartRedis client library
Provides clients that connect to the Orchestrator from Fortran, C, C++, Python code
The client API library enables data transfer to/from database and ability to load and run JIT-traced Python and ML runtimes acting on stored data

For more resources on SmartSim, follow the links below:

To use SmartSim in the future, simply load the same modules and source the virtual environment.</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Click the Y Axis button to set the seed line to run along the Y axis.

The default Resolution is set to 100. This will make things a bit cluttered, especially when we start adding in the other data, so let's reduce this to 25

Click the Apply button

6. Streamlines as Tubes

The streamlines are just that, lines. We can use the Tubes filter to represent them as 3D objects, rather than just lines.
- With StreamTracer1selected in the Pipeline Browser, from the main menu select: Filters->Alphabetical->Tube
- In the Object Inspector make sure the Properties tab is selected
- The default value for the Radius is a bit too large for this data, let's set that value to 0
- Click the Apply button
- Notice that the StreamLine1 object has automatically been hidden
- There are many different ways to color these tubes
- With Tubes1 selected, switch to the Display tab in the Object Inspector
- The Color bydropdown lets you choose from a handful of different variables

7. Cutting Planes (Slices)

Now let's add some cutting plans, or slices, to see what the cross-section of the continuum data looks like.
- Again, be sure that the continuum.000*data is selected in the Pipeline Browser
- Filters->Alphabetical->Slice or Click on the Slice icon from the menu bar
- In the Object Inspector make sure the Propertiestab is selected
- At the bottom on the Object Inspector is a section titled Slice Offset Values. Here we can generate values for multiple slices to be made
- First click the Delete All button to remove initial values
- Next, click the New Range button. This will bring up an Add Range dialog box.
- Set the number of Steps to 7. Click OK
- Click the Apply button
- With Slice1 selected in the Object Inspector, switch to the Display tab
- Set Color by value to Velocity

8. Data Representation: Opacity</DOCUMENT>

User: Can you show me how to add cutting planes or slices to visualize cross-sectional data in VTK?
Assistant: To add cutting planes or slices to visualize cross-sectional data in VTK, select the continuum.000*data, reduce the resolution, use the Tubes filter, add a Slice filter, set the Slice Offset Values, and adjust the Color by value and opacity as needed.

<DOCUMENT>Datascience Anaconda Module Updates

We have updated the datascience Anaconda module and built various packages and libraries with CUDA 12.4.1 to be compatible with 
the new Polaris NVIDIA GPU hardware driver (CUDA 12.2) and to use the latest MPI, NCCL, cuDNN, TensorRT, etc. libraries. 
PyTorch 2.3.0 and TensorFlow 2.16.1 are now available as part of this module.

To use the new environment, type:
module use /soft/modulefiles 
module load conda; conda activate

/soft refresh and default $MODULEPATH change

Due to the new system software stack, /soft has been purged to allow for
software to be rebuilt. In addition, /soft/modulefiles is no longer in the
default $MODULEPATH. To access modules installed in /soft, users should run
module use /soft/modulefiles.

Adding module use /soft/modulefiles to your profile should approximate the old behavior.

Modules removed

The following modules have been removed:</DOCUMENT>

<DOCUMENT>[""Balsam\n\nBalsam is a Python-based workflow manager that helps users execute large numbers of jobs, potentially with interjob dependencies, track job outcomes, and manage postprocessing analysis. A Balsam Site runs on a node with access to the job scheduler, where it can submit and monitor jobs. Overall job state is aggregated on the Balsam Server, making job data from all Sites accessible from any individual site (or the user's laptop), via the command-line interface or the Python API. To get information on how to use the command line tool, you can type balsam --help in your shell.\n\nFull documentation for Balsam is available online.\n\nBalsam requires Python 3.7+. To install Balsam on Polaris, first set up a virtual Python environment:\n\nshell\nmodule load conda\nconda activate base\npython -m venv env\nsource env/bin/activate\npip install --upgrade pip\npip install --pre balsam\n\nTo use Balsam, users need an account on the Balsam server.  Users can get an account by contacting the ALCF Help Desk.  Once a user has an account, they can login and make a new site.  A Balsam site is a project space for your workflow.

Users with different needs, such as assigning multiple GPUs per MPI rank, can modify the above script to suit their needs.

Interactive Jobs on Compute Nodes

Here is how to submit an interactive job to, for example, edit/build/test an application Polaris compute nodes:
qsub -I -l select=1 -l filesystems=home:eagle -l walltime=1:00:00 -q debug -A <project_name>

This command requests 1 node for a period of 1 hour in the debug queue, requiring access to the /home and eagle filesystems. After waiting in the queue for a node to become available, a shell prompt on a compute node will appear. You may then start building applications and testing gpu affinity scripts on the compute node.

NOTE: If you want to ssh or scp to one of your assigned compute nodes you will need to make sure your $HOME directory and your $HOME/.ssh directory permissions are both set to 700.

<DOCUMENT>8. Data Representation: Opacity

Even with the continuum data represented as wireframe, there is still considerable occlusion of the interior structures. In order to further reduce this occlusion by the wireframe, we can make it more transparent.

Again, be sure that the continuum.000*data is selected in the Pipeline Browser

In the Object Inspector make sure the Display tab is selected

In the Object Inspector there is a section titled Style

Set Opacity to 0.2

9. Animating Simulation Data

Since our data has multiple time steps, we can easily animate through them to see how the data changes over time.

Simply click the Play button on the animation bar at the top of the GUI

Pause to make it stop

Loop: With this button toggled on, animation will repeat until stopped

10. Animations

Animations can be saved to disk as a movie file, to be played back later.

From the main menu: File->Save Animation

Animation Settings Dialog: Save Animation

Files of type: AVI files (*.avi)

Enter a name in File name:

Click OK

Movie can be played back with standard media players (Windows Media Player, QuickTime, VLC, etc.)

11. Particles as Glyphs

Glyphs are another way of visually representing data where the attributes of a graphical element are dictated by attributes of the data.

All of the particles are displayed as red points in the graphics window. There are ~39K particles in this particular data set, which makes the display a bit cluttered. In order to both filter some of these out, and create 3D representations for them, let's apply a glyph filter to this data.

Now let's add some of our other data back into the scene. Let's start with the particle data.

All of the particles are displayed as red points in the graphics window. There are ~39K particles in this particular data set, which makes the display rather cluttered.

The following modules are useful for this particular build. Note, the cmake module is not required if using the GNU Makefile procedure to build LAMMPS. The initial module restore is just setting the default environment as the starting point. Users may find it useful to copy these module commands into a small helper script to assist with compiling and running LAMMPS (e.g. setup_lammps_nvhpc.sh).</DOCUMENT>

Queue Name Node Min Node Max Time Min Time Max Notes debug 1 2 5 min 1 hr max 24 nodes in use by this queue ay any given time; Only 8 nodes are exclusive (see Note below) debug-scaling 1 10 5 min 1 hr max 1 job running/accruing/queued per-user prod 10 496 5 min 24 hrs Routing queue; See below preemptable 1 10 5 min 72 hrs Please be aware that jobs in the preemptable queue can be killed at any time if jobs are submitted to the demand queue. Max 20 jobs running/accruing/queued per-project ; see Note below demand 1 56 5 min 1 hr By request only ; max 100 jobs running/accruing/queued per-project

Note: Please be aware that jobs in the preemptable queue can be killed at any time if jobs are submitted to the demand queue.
Jobs in the demand queue take priority over jobs in the preemptable queue.
This means jobs in the preemptable queue may be preempted (killed without any warning) if there are jobs in the demand queue.
Unfortunately, there's always an inherent risk of jobs being killed when using the preemptable queue. 
Please use the following command to view details of a queue: qstat -Qf <queuename>

To make your job re-runable add the following PBS directive: #PBS -r y This will ensure your job will restart once the demand job is complete.

Note: The debug queue has 8 exclusively dedicated nodes.
If there are free nodes in production, then debug jobs can take another 16 nodes for a total of 24.

prod is routing queue and routes your job to one of the following six execution queues:

Queue Name Node Min Node Max Time Min Time Max Notes small 10 24 5 min 3 hrs medium 25 99 5 min 6 hrs large 100 496 5 min 24 hrs backfill-small 10 24 5 min 3 hrs low priority, negative project balance backfill-medium 25 99 5 min 6 hrs low priority, negative project balance backfill-large 100 496 5 min 24 hrs low priority, negative project balance</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>CMake

CMake

CMake is a build configuration system that uses higher-level description files
to automatically generate Makefiles.

CMake website

CMake on Polaris

To use CMake on Polaris, run

module use /soft/modulefiles
module load spack-pe-base cmake</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>8. Data Representation: Opacity

Even with the continuum data represented as wireframe, there is still considerable occlusion of the interior structures. In order to further reduce this occlusion by the wireframe, we can make it more transparent.

Again, be sure that the continuum.000*data is selected in the Pipeline Browser

In the Object Inspector make sure the Display tab is selected

In the Object Inspector there is a section titled Style

Set Opacity to 0.2

9. Animating Simulation Data

Since our data has multiple time steps, we can easily animate through them to see how the data changes over time.

Simply click the Play button on the animation bar at the top of the GUI

Pause to make it stop

Loop: With this button toggled on, animation will repeat until stopped

10. Animations

Animations can be saved to disk as a movie file, to be played back later.

From the main menu: File->Save Animation

Animation Settings Dialog: Save Animation

Files of type: AVI files (*.avi)

Enter a name in File name:

Click OK

Movie can be played back with standard media players (Windows Media Player, QuickTime, VLC, etc.)

11. Particles as Glyphs

Glyphs are another way of visually representing data where the attributes of a graphical element are dictated by attributes of the data.

All of the particles are displayed as red points in the graphics window. There are ~39K particles in this particular data set, which makes the display a bit cluttered. In order to both filter some of these out, and create 3D representations for them, let's apply a glyph filter to this data.

Now let's add some of our other data back into the scene. Let's start with the particle data.

All of the particles are displayed as red points in the graphics window. There are ~39K particles in this particular data set, which makes the display rather cluttered.

<DOCUMENT>Spack PE

Spack is an HPC-oriented package manager which ALCF uses to install software for
the user environment.

ALCF's Spack PE is a Spack-managed software stack which provides various build
tools, utilities, and libraries. It consists of a base stack (spack-pe-base)
and PrgEnv-dependent stacks (currently spack-pe-gnu).

spack-pe-base contains commonplace software compiled for CPU with the system
GCC compilers. Accordingly, the software in spack-pe-base can be used
regardless of programming environment.

spack-pe-gnu is based on the E4S Project and
provides performant HPC libraries built with PrgEnv-gnu and the nvcc CUDA
compiler driver for GPU code. spack-pe-gnu is dependent on both
spack-pe-base and PrgEnv-gnu.

Using software from the Spack PE

The base suite of software tools and libraries can be accessed by loading the
spack-pe-base module. This adds a path to $MODULEPATH which contains
numerous modules.

For example, to load cmake starting from the default environment, a user
should run the following commands:
module use /soft/modulefiles
module load spack-pe-base
module load cmake

The spack-pe-base module adds paths to the user's MODULEPATH; individual packages are subsequently loaded through the newly available modules. The full list of available packages can be viewed by running module avail or module --show-hidden avail for a complete listing. Packages are loaded in the same way from spack-pe-gnu.

Inspecting packages

When a module in the Spack PE is loaded, several environment variables are
updated to integrate the package into the user's environment. Additionally, the
PACKAGE_ROOT variable is set to the path to the installation prefix of the
package. For example, after loading cmake as above:

$ echo $CMAKE_ROOT
/soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/install/linux-sles15-x86_64/gcc-12.3.0/cmake-3.27.7-a435jtzvweeos2es6enirbxdjdqhqgdp/
$ ls -a $CMAKE_ROOT
.  ..  bin  doc  share  .spack</DOCUMENT>

Assistant: Glyphs in visualizing data represent particle data attributes by assigning graphical element attributes to the particles' attributes.

Julia Project Environment

The Julia built-in package manager allows you to create a project and enable
project-specific dependencies. Julia manages packages in the Julia depot located
by default in ~/.julia. However, that NFS filesystem is not meant for
high-speed access. Therefore, this Julia depot folder should be located on a
fast filesystem of your choice (grand, eagle). The Julia depot directory is
set via the environment variable JULIA_DEPOT_PATH. For example, you can set
the Julia depot to a directory on Polaris grand filesystem by adding the following line
to your ~/.bashrc file:

bash
export JULIA_DEPOT_PATH=/grand/$PROJECT/$USER/julia_depot

Programming Julia on Polaris

There are three key components to using Julia for large-scale computations:

MPI support through MPI.jl

GPU support through CUDA.jl

HDF5 support through HDF5.jl

In addition, we recommend VSCode with the Julia
extension for a modern IDE experience, together
with the ssh-remote extension for remote interactive development.

MPI Support

MPI support is provided through the MPI.jl.
bash
$ julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(""MPI"")'
This will install the MPI.jl package and default MPI prebuilt binaries provided by an artifact. For on-node debugging purposes the default artifact is sufficient. However, for large-scale computations, it is important to use the Cray MPICH installed on Polaris. As of MPI.jl v0.20 this is handled through MPIPrefences.jl.
$ julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(""MPIPreferences"")'
$ julia --project -e 'using MPIPreferences; MPIPreferences.use_system_binary(vendor=""cray"")'

The vendor=""cray"" option is important if you intend to use gpu-aware MPI in your applications.

Check that the correct MPI library is targeted with Julia.
```
julia --project -e 'using MPI; MPI.versioninfo()'
MPIPreferences:
  binary:  system
  abi:     MPICH
  libmpi:  libmpi_nvidia.so

Since our goal was to unclutter the display, let's hide the particles.000*by toggling them off, by clicking on the Eye icon next to it in the Pipeline Browser

Let's also switch to the Display tab in the Object Inspector, with Glyph1 selected, and change the Color by value to GlyphVector. Since the GlyphVector value is based on the velocity. We can Edit Color Map...and choose the same Blue to Red Rainbow preset that we previously chose for velocity

12. Enter: Red Blood Cells

Now let's add in both of the other data sets, which are polygonal meshes which make up Red Blood Cells (RBCs).

These two data sets are essentially the same kind of data, so we can apply the same filters and make the same types of representation changes to each of them. However, some of the RBCs are marked by the simulation that generated them as healthy (rbc.000) and some of them are marked as diseased (bad_rbc.000).

Unhide the rbc.000 and bad_rbc.000 data sets by clicking the Eye icon next to each of them to make them visible

13. Using Color to Differentiate Data

To enable us to distinguish these two types of data from one other, we can vary their representations.

One way to do this is by setting the color of the two data sets to different colors. Repeat this process for each of rbc.000 and bad_rbc.000, picking different colors.

Select one of the rbc data sets in the Pipeline Browser

Introduction

CUDA-GDB is the NVIDIA tool for debugging CUDA applications running on Polaris. CUDA-GDB is an extension to GDB, the GNU Project debugger. The tool provides developers with a mechanism for debugging CUDA applications running on actual hardware. This enables developers to debug applications without the potential variations introduced by simulation and emulation environments.

Step-by-step guide

Debug Compilation

NVCC, the NVIDIA CUDA compiler driver, provides a mechanism for generating the debugging information necessary for CUDA-GDB to work properly. The -g -G option pair must be passed to NVCC when an application is compiled for ease of debugging with CUDA-GDB; for example,
nvcc -g -G foo.cu -o foo
Using this line to compile the CUDA application foo.cu
* forces -O0 compilation, with the exception of very limited dead-code eliminations and register-spilling optimizations.
* makes the compiler include debug information in the executable

Running CUDA-gdb on Polaris compute nodes

Start an interactive job mode on Polaris as follows:

```
$ qsub -I -l select=1 -l walltime=1:00:00

$ cuda-gdb --version

<DOCUMENT>Balsam

Balsam is a Python-based workflow manager that helps users execute large numbers of jobs, potentially with interjob dependencies, track job outcomes, and manage postprocessing analysis. A Balsam Site runs on a node with access to the job scheduler, where it can submit and monitor jobs. Overall job state is aggregated on the Balsam Server, making job data from all Sites accessible from any individual site (or the user's laptop), via the command-line interface or the Python API. To get information on how to use the command line tool, you can type balsam --help in your shell.

Full documentation for Balsam is available online.

Balsam requires Python 3.7+. To install Balsam on Polaris, first set up a virtual Python environment:

shell
module load conda
conda activate base
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --pre balsam

To use Balsam, users need an account on the Balsam server.  Users can get an account by contacting the ALCF Help Desk.  Once a user has an account, they can login and make a new site.  A Balsam site is a project space for your workflow. You will be prompted to select what machine (Polaris) you are working on when creating a new site:

shell
balsam login
balsam site init -n new-site new-site
cd new-site
balsam site start

<DOCUMENT>Use TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.  Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.  When possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention.

Use XLA compilation on your code.  XLA is the Accelerated Linear Algebra library that is available in tensorFlow and critical in software like JAX.  XLA will compile a tf.Graph object, generated with tf.function or similar, and perform optimizations like operation-fusion.  XLA can give impressive performance boosts with almost no user changes except to set an environment variable TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2.  If your code is complex, or has dynamically sized tensors (tensors where the shape changes every iteration), XLA can be detrimental: the overhead for compiling functions can be large enough to mitigate performance improvements.  XLA is particularly powerful when combined with reduced precision, yielding speedups > 100% in some models.

Multi-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up

TensorFlow is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with tensorFlow has been seen with horovod in particular.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation.  Some polaris specific details that may be helpful to you:

CPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.  In particular, we encourage users to try their scaling measurements with the following settings:

Context: <DOCUMENT>Kokkos

Kokkos

Kokkos Core implements a programming model in C++ for writing performance
portable applications targeting all major HPC platforms. For that purpose it
provides abstractions for both parallel execution of code and data
management. Kokkos is designed to target complex node architectures with
N-level memory hierarchies and multiple types of execution resources. It
currently can use Serial and OpenMP (threads) for CPU execution spaces
(""backends"") and CUDA, HIP, SYCL, and OpenMPTarget for GPU execution
spaces. By convention, Kokkos only allows one GPU backend at a time.

Kokkos Documentation

Kokkos on Polaris

Following the Polaris upgrade to HPCM
1.10,
the module setup to use the prebuilt Kokkos changed.

The prebuilt Kokkos on polaris includes 3 backends: Serial and OpenMP for CPU
execution and CUDA for GPU execution. To use it, run

module load craype-x86-milan
module load craype-accel-nvidia80
module swap PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-gnu
module use /soft/modulefiles
module load cuda-PrgEnv-nvidia/12.2.91
module load kokkos

This sets the following environment variables, some of which are used by
cmake:

KOKKOS_HOME - path to the lib64/, include/ files installed

LIBRARY_PATH - prepends $KOKKOS_HOME/lib64 to this variable used by cmake

CPATH - prepends $KOKKOS_HOME/include to this variable used by cmake

LD_LIBRARY_PATH - prepends $KOKKOS_HOME/lib64 to this variable

Building a Kokkos Application Using cmake

Add these lines to CMakeLists.txt:

find_package(Kokkos REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(myTarget Kokkos::kokkoscore)

Here is a simple example CMakeLists.txt to compile an example program:

```
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.22)
project(buildExample)
find_package(Kokkos REQUIRED)

set(buildExample_SOURCE_DIR ""."")

set(top_SRCS

```

With the appropriate LAMMPS Makefile in place an executable can be compiled as in the following example. Note, per-user limits on the login nodes will reduce the maximum parallelism for compilation. Users are encouraged to compile on a compute node in an interactive session if necessary.

cd lammps-<version>/src
make yes-KOKKOS
make polaris_nvhpc_kokkos -j 32

Getting Started

The latest VisIt versions installed on Polaris are 3.3.3 and 3.4.0.

Please note that at the time of this writing VisIt version 3.4.0 does not yet have a client for Mac available.

Follow these steps to install VisIt on your local machine:

Download and install VisIt for your local platform (MacOS, Windows, Linux). The version you download must match the server version installed on Polaris. Use this page

Download the Polaris host profile for VisIt (you may need to right-click and choose ""Save link as..."" or ""Save target as..."")

Copy this file to a file called ~/.visit/hosts/host_anl_polaris.xml on Mac or Linux. [ We need to also specify this path for for Windows]

Note: VisIt allows the user to download host profiles for ANL, but all these settings are outdated. We are working with the VisIt developers to update the ANL host list.

Additional information for using VisIt in client/server mode here

Running VisIt

Start up VisIt on your local machine

Click File -> Open File and choose ""ANL Polaris"" from the ""Host"" dropdown

You'll be prompted for your password; enter your ALCF authenticator app response

When you open a selected file, it will launch a job on Polaris
You will need to specify the ""Bank"" (Project) to use when VisIt submits jobs to the queue on Polaris. Specify a project in the Options box.
If your environment doesn't get sourced correctly with non-interactive SSH, you can set the default project to use under Options -> Host profiles

<DOCUMENT>and launch the ParaView server with

srizzi@x3005c0s7b0n0:~> mpirun -n 8 pvserver --server-port=8000
Waiting for client...
Connection URL: cs://x3005c0s7b0n0:8000
Accepting connection(s): x3005c0s7b0n0:8000

In this case pvserver will be listening on TCP port 8000 of your head node. You can change this port if you want.

Creating a tunnel over ssh

We need to establish an ssh tunnel to connect client to server. On your local machine open a new terminal and type:

ssh -v -N -L 8000:x3005c0s7b0n0:8000 polaris.alcf.anl.gov

where 8000 is a TCP port and x3005c0s7b0n0 the name of your head node. Adjust these values accordingly.

Among multiple lines with debug information,  you should see something like:

debug1: Local connections to LOCALHOST:8000 forwarded to remote address x3005c0s7b0n0:8000

Keep this terminal open for the duration of your session to keep the ssh tunnel active.

Now you are ready to launch your ParaView client locally. Keep in mind that client and servers versions must match. The ParaView version currently deployed on Polaris is 5.12.0

Connecting to ParaView server

Connect your ParaView client to the server configuration you created above. You can select Connect, either from the File menu, or the icon circled in the figure:

and selecting the configuration you created in a previous step.

The connection should point to:

localhost:8000

In the terminal where you launched the server you will see now that the connection is established. Note that ParaView may take a few seconds to connect. This is normal behavior.

Waiting for client...
Connection URL: cs://x3005c0s7b0n0:8000
Accepting connection(s): x3005c0s7b0n0:8000

Context: <DOCUMENT>8. Data Representation: Opacity

Even with the continuum data represented as wireframe, there is still considerable occlusion of the interior structures. In order to further reduce this occlusion by the wireframe, we can make it more transparent.

Again, be sure that the continuum.000*data is selected in the Pipeline Browser

In the Object Inspector make sure the Display tab is selected

In the Object Inspector there is a section titled Style

Set Opacity to 0.2

9. Animating Simulation Data

Since our data has multiple time steps, we can easily animate through them to see how the data changes over time.

Simply click the Play button on the animation bar at the top of the GUI

Pause to make it stop

Loop: With this button toggled on, animation will repeat until stopped

10. Animations

Animations can be saved to disk as a movie file, to be played back later.

From the main menu: File->Save Animation

Animation Settings Dialog: Save Animation

Files of type: AVI files (*.avi)

Enter a name in File name:

Click OK

Movie can be played back with standard media players (Windows Media Player, QuickTime, VLC, etc.)

11. Particles as Glyphs

Glyphs are another way of visually representing data where the attributes of a graphical element are dictated by attributes of the data.

All of the particles are displayed as red points in the graphics window. There are ~39K particles in this particular data set, which makes the display a bit cluttered. In order to both filter some of these out, and create 3D representations for them, let's apply a glyph filter to this data.

Now let's add some of our other data back into the scene. Let's start with the particle data.

All of the particles are displayed as red points in the graphics window. There are ~39K particles in this particular data set, which makes the display rather cluttered. In order to both filter some of these out, and create 3D representations for them, we will apply the glyph filter to this data.</DOCUMENT>

<DOCUMENT>3. Use ParaView

After the previous step, you can now select POLARIS@ANL in the File->Connect menu and press Connect

At this point a new window will pop up

There are a number of parameters that you must enter manually here:

Xterm executable: the path of a terminal on your system. The figure shows the case of a Mac with XQuartz. You may need to change these values for Windows or Linux.

SSH executable: the name of your ssh command. It may be different on Windows depending on the ssh client installed (i.e putty)

Remote machine: leave this value at polaris.alcf.anl.gov

Username: your ALCF user name

ParaView version: the version of Paraview that you want to use. Verify first that this version is installed on the system (as described at the top of this document). You will also need to add a -EGL suffix.

Example:
5.12.0-EGL

Client port: it is safe to use the default value

Server port: is is safe to use the default value

Number of nodes to reserve: enter the number of Polaris compute nodes you want to use for your job

Number of ranks per node: enter the number of ranks per node

Number of minutes to reserve: the duration of your job in minutes

Account: enter here the name of your ALCF allocation

Queue: the name of the Polaris queue you would like to use (i.e: debug for small, quick jobs, prod, preemptable)

File Systems: enter here the file systems you need for your job, separated with colons, no spaces. Keep in mind that your job may not run if one of these file systems is not available at that time, so enter these values carefully

Job name: safe to use default value. The PBS scheduler will assign this name to your job

Now you can press OK to establish the connection with a ParaView server on Polaris.

An ssh connection will be established with a Polaris login node and a password will be requested in a terminal, similar to the process you normally use to connect and work on the system.</DOCUMENT>

<DOCUMENT>TensorFlow on Polaris

TensorFlow is a popular, open-source deep learning framework developed and released by Google.  The TensorFlow home page has more information about TensorFlow, which you can refer to.  For trouble shooting on Polaris, please contact support@alcf.anl.gov.

Installation on Polaris

TensorFlow is already pre-installed on Polaris, available in the conda module.  To use it from a compute node, please do:

bash
module load conda
conda activate

Then, you can load TensorFlow in python as usual (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):

```python

import tensorflow as tf
tf.version
'2.9.1'

```

This installation of TensorFlow was built from source and the CUDA libraries it uses are found via the CUDA_HOME environment variable (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):

bash
$ echo $CUDA_HOME
/soft/datascience/cuda/cuda_11.5.2_495.29.05_linux

If you need to build applications that use this version of TensorFlow and CUDA, we recommend using these cuda libraries to ensure compatibility.  We periodically update the TensorFlow release, though updates will come in the form of new versions of the conda module.

TensorFlow is also available through NVIDIA containers that have been translated to Singularity containers.  For more information about containers, please see the Containers documentation page.

TensorFlow Best Practices on Polaris

Single Node Performance

When running TensorFlow applications, we have found the following practices to be generally, if not universally, useful and encourage you to try some of these techniques to boost performance of your own applications.

Use Reduced Precision. Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with TensorFlow operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the tf.keras.mixed_precision Policy, as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  If you use a custom training loop (and not keras.Model.fit), you will also need to apply loss scaling.</DOCUMENT>

<DOCUMENT>ImageMagick on Polaris

To use ImageMagick on Polaris first load the corresponding module:

module use /soft/modulefiles
module load spack-pe-base imagemagick</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>ParaView and Visit

ParaView module has been updated. For more information, see https://docs.alcf.anl.gov/polaris/visualization/paraview/ and https://docs.alcf.anl.gov/polaris/visualization/paraview-manual-launch/

Visit module is in the process of being updated.

Changes to Memory Limits on Login Nodes

Memory limits were lowered on the logins due to resource contention to 8GB of memory, and 8 cores per user. 
This might result in error messages indicating abnormal process termination for user processes run on logins.

Examples of the error messages people might see are:

nvcc error   : 'cudafe++' died due to signal 9 (Kill signal)

g++-12: fatal error: Killed signal terminated program cc1plus

These errors are likely due to exhausting the per-user resources on a login node as each user is allocated 8 cores and 8GB memory.
To avoid this you can either:

Reduce the parallelism of your compile, such as using -j or -j4 flags

Request a debug node and run your compile there where you will have the full resources of the node at your disposal</DOCUMENT>

<DOCUMENT>Balsam

Balsam is a Python-based workflow manager that helps users execute large numbers of jobs, potentially with interjob dependencies, track job outcomes, and manage postprocessing analysis. A Balsam Site runs on a node with access to the job scheduler, where it can submit and monitor jobs. Overall job state is aggregated on the Balsam Server, making job data from all Sites accessible from any individual site (or the user's laptop), via the command-line interface or the Python API. To get information on how to use the command line tool, you can type balsam --help in your shell.

Full documentation for Balsam is available online.

Balsam requires Python 3.7+. To install Balsam on Polaris, first set up a virtual Python environment:

shell
module load conda
conda activate base
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --pre balsam

To use Balsam, users need an account on the Balsam server.  Users can get an account by contacting the ALCF Help Desk.  Once a user has an account, they can login and make a new site.  A Balsam site is a project space for your workflow. You will be prompted to select what machine (Polaris) you are working on when creating a new site:

shell
balsam login
balsam site init -n new-site new-site
cd new-site
balsam site start

See the Balsam documentation for full details.</DOCUMENT>

Context: <DOCUMENT>Polaris System Updates

2024-04-22

The management software on Polaris has been upgraded to HPCM 1.10
The following version changes are in place with the upgrade to HPCM 1.10:

HPE Cray Programming Environment (CPE) 23.12

SlingShot version 2.1.2

NVIDIA SDK 23.9

NVIDIA driver version 535.154.05

CUDA 12.2

SUSE 15 SP5

Releasing jobs

Jobs that were queued before the upgrade have been restored to the appropriate queues but are placed on user hold. 
Jobs are not expected to complete successfully due to the changes made to the system and software environments resulting from the upgrade. 
We recommend you review your jobs and either release the hold (qrls <jobid>) or delete it (qdel <jobid>) and resubmit as appropriate.

Users need to rebuild for the new PE environment and major OS upgrade. Existing binaries are unlikely to run successfully.

We have held all jobs submitted prior to the upgrade as a user hold. Users may release their existing jobs with qrls to run after they have rebuilt their binaries.

PBS does cache the job execution script.  If a change to the script is required due to a path changing post rebuild, the job will have to be resubmitted.

All application binaries should be rebuilt prior to further job submissions.

Re-building user codes

Many user codes will need to be re-built and/or re-linked against the newer version of the programming environment (23.12) and Spack provided dependencies.

Changes to the user software environment

In addition to the system upgrades, several changes have been made to the user
software environment which may impact user workflows.

Older PE versions removed

Older versions of the Cray PE (older than 23.12) are deprecated as they are incompatible with the
upgraded system stack and are no longer available for use.

Datascience Anaconda Module Updates</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Getting Started on Polaris

Logging Into Polaris

To log into Polaris:
ssh <username>@polaris.alcf.anl.gov
Then, type in the password from your CRYPTOCard/MobilePASS+ token.

Hardware Overview

An overview of the Polaris system including details on the compute node architecture is available on the Machine Overview page.

Compiling Applications

Users are encouraged to read through the Compiling and Linking Overview page and corresponding pages depending on the target compiler and programming model.

Accessing Additional Software

In addition to the Cray PE, ALCF installs software in /soft which can be
accessed via module commands by altering your $MODULEPATH:
module use /soft/modulefiles
The available software can then be queried with module avail.

Additionally, a suite of software packages are provided via Spack deployments,
detailed on the Spack PE
page.

Submitting and Running Jobs

Users are encouraged to read through the Running Jobs with PBS at the ALCF page for information on using the PBS scheduler and preparing job submission scripts. Some example job submission scripts are available on the Example Job Scripts page as well.

<DOCUMENT>Running Multiple MPI Applications on a node

Multiple applications can be run simultaneously on a node by launching several mpiexec commands and backgrounding them. For performance, it will likely be necessary to ensure that each application runs on a distinct set of CPU resources and/or targets specific GPUs. One can provide a list of CPUs using the --cpu-bind option, which when combined with CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES provides a user with specifying exactly which CPU and GPU resources to run each application on. In the example below, four instances of the application are simultaneously running on a single node. In the first instance, the application is spawning MPI ranks 0-7 on CPUs 24-31 and using GPU 0. This mapping is based on output from the nvidia-smi topo -m command and pairs CPUs with the closest GPU.

```bash
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
mpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:24:25:26:27:28:29:30:31 ./hello_affinity &

export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1
mpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:16:17:18:19:20:21:22:23 ./hello_affinity &

export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2
mpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:8:9:10:11:12:13:14:15 ./hello_affinity &

export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=3
mpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:0:1:2:3:4:5:6:7 ./hello_affinity &

wait
```

Compute Node Access to the Internet

Currently, the only access the internet is via a proxy.  Here are the proxy environment variables for Polaris:

bash
export http_proxy=""http://proxy.alcf.anl.gov:3128""
export https_proxy=""http://proxy.alcf.anl.gov:3128""
export ftp_proxy=""http://proxy.alcf.anl.gov:3128""

In the future, though we don't have a timeline on this because it depends on future features in slingshot and internal software development, we intend to have public IP addresses be a schedulable resource.  For instance, if only your head node needed public access your select statement might looks something like: -l select=1:pubnet=True+63.

Context: <DOCUMENT>Example Programs and Makefiles for Polaris

Several simple examples of building CPU and GPU-enabled codes on Polaris are available in the ALCF GettingStart repo for several programming models. If build your application is problematic for some reason (e.g. absence of a GPU), then users are encouraged to build and test applications directly on one of the Polaris compute nodes via an interactive job. The discussion below makes use of the NVHPC compilers in the default environment as illustrative examples. Similar examples for other compilers on Polaris are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo.

CPU MPI+OpenMP Example

One of the first useful tasks with any new machine, scheduler, and job launcher is to ensure one is binding MPI ranks and OpenMP threads to the host cpu as intended. A simple HelloWorld MPI+OpenMP example is available here to get started with.

The application can be straightforwardly compiled using the Cray compiler wrappers.
CC -fopenmp main.cpp -o hello_affinity

The executable hello_affinity can then be launched in a job script (or directly in shell of interactive job) using mpiexec as discussed here.

```

!/bin/sh

PBS -l select=1:system=polaris

CUDA

Several variants of C/C++ and Fortran CUDA examples are available here that include MPI and multi-gpu examples.

One can use the Cray compiler wrappers to compile GPU-enabled applications as well. This example of simple vector addition uses the NVIDIA compilers.

<DOCUMENT>Parsl on Polaris

Parsl is a flexible and scalable parallel programming library for Python.

-- Parsl Documentation

For many applications, managing an ensemble of jobs into a workflow is a critical step that can easily become a performance bottleneck.  Many tools exist to address this, of which parsl is just one.  On this page, we'll highlight some of the key pieces of information about parsl that are relevant to Polaris.  Parsl is also extensively documented, has a dedicated Slack Channel, and a large community of users and developers beyond ALCF.  We encourage you to engage with the parsl community for support with parsl specific questions, and for Polaris-specific questions or problems, please contact support@alcf.anl.gov.

Getting Parsl on Polaris

You can install parsl building off of the conda modules.  You have some flexibility in how you want to extend the conda module to include parsl, but here is an example way to do it:

```python

Load the Conda Module (needed everytime you use parsl)

module load conda
conda activate

Create a virtual env that uses the conda env as the system packages.

Only do the next line on initial set up:

python -m venv --system-site-packages /path/to/your/virtualenv

Load the virtual env (every time):

source /path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/activate

Install parsl (only once)

pip install parsl

```

Using Parsl on Polaris

Parsl has a variety of possible configuration settings.  As an example, we provide the configuration below that will run one task per GPU:

```python
from parsl.config import Config

PBSPro is the right provider for Polaris:

from parsl.providers import PBSProProvider

The high throughput executor is for scaling to HPC systems:

from parsl.executors import HighThroughputExecutor

You can use the MPI launcher, but may want the Gnu Parallel launcher, see below

from parsl.launchers import MpiExecLauncher, GnuParallelLauncher

address_by_interface is needed for the HighThroughputExecutor:</DOCUMENT>

Context: <DOCUMENT>LLVM Compilers on Polaris

This page is not about LLVM-based Cray Compiling Environment (CCE) compilers from PrgEnv-cray but about open source LLVM compilers.

If LLVM compilers are needed without MPI support, simply load the llvm module.

Cray Programming Environment does not offer LLVM compiler support.
Thus cc/CC/ftn compiler wrappers using LLVM compilers currently are not available.
To use Clang with MPI, one can load the mpiwrappers/cray-mpich-llvm module which loads the following modules.

llvm, upstream llvm compilers

cray-mpich, MPI compiler wrappers mpicc/mpicxx/mpif90. mpif90 uses gfortran because flang is not ready for production use.

cray-pals, MPI launchers mpiexec/aprun/mpirun

Limitation There is no GPU-aware MPI library linking support by default. If needed, users should manually add the GTL (GPU Transport Layer) library to the application link line.

Update 04/25/2024 To access LLVM modules, module use /soft/modulefiles is required.

OpenMP offload

When targeting the OpenMP or CUDA programming models for GPUs, the cudatoolkit-standalone module should also be loaded.</DOCUMENT>

Since our goal was to unclutter the display, let's hide the particles.000*by toggling them off, by clicking on the Eye icon next to it in the Pipeline Browser

Let's also switch to the Display tab in the Object Inspector, with Glyph1 selected, and change the Color by value to GlyphVector. Since the GlyphVector value is based on the velocity. We can Edit Color Map...and choose the same Blue to Red Rainbow preset that we previously chose for velocity

12. Enter: Red Blood Cells

Now let's add in both of the other data sets, which are polygonal meshes which make up Red Blood Cells (RBCs).

These two data sets are essentially the same kind of data, so we can apply the same filters and make the same types of representation changes to each of them. However, some of the RBCs are marked by the simulation that generated them as healthy (rbc.000) and some of them are marked as diseased (bad_rbc.000).

Unhide the rbc.000 and bad_rbc.000 data sets by clicking the Eye icon next to each of them to make them visible

13. Using Color to Differentiate Data

To enable us to distinguish these two types of data from one other, we can vary their representations.

One way to do this is by setting the color of the two data sets to different colors. Repeat this process for each of rbc.000 and bad_rbc.000, picking different colors.

Select one of the rbc data sets in the Pipeline Browser

Go to the Displaytab in the Object Inspector

In the Color by:dropdown select Solid Color

Click on the Set Solid Color... button

<DOCUMENT>Programming Models on Polaris

The software environment on Polaris supports several parallel programming models targeting the CPUs and GPUs.

CPU Parallel Programming Models

The Cray compiler wrappers cc, CC, and ftn are recommended for MPI applications as they provide the needed include paths and libraries for each programming environment. A summary of available CPU parallel programming models and relevant compiler flags is shown below. Users are encouraged to review the corresponding man pages and documentation.

Programming Model GNU NVHPC LLVM OpenMP -fopenmp -mp -fopenmp OpenACC -- -acc=multicore --

Higher-level programming models such as Kokkos and Raja may also be used for CPU programming.

GPU Programming Models

A summary of available GPU programming models and relevant compiler flags is shown below for compilers that generate offloadable code. Users are encouraged to review the corresponding man pages and documentation.

Programming Model GNU NVHPC LLVM ONEAPI CUDA -- -cuda [-gpu=cuda8.0,cc11.0] -- -- HIP* -- -- -- -- OpenACC -- -acc -- -- OpenCL* -- -- -- -- OpenMP -- -mp=gpu -fopenmp-targets=nvptx64 -- SYCL -- -- -- -fsycl -fsycl-targets=nvptx64-nvidia-cuda -Xsycl-target-backend --cuda-gpu-arch=sm_80

Note, the llvm and oneapi modules are provided by ALCF to complement the compilers provided by the Cray PE on Polaris.

Higher-level programming models such as Kokkos and Raja may also be used for GPU programming.

OpenCL is supported, but does not require specific compiler flags per-se as the offloaded kernels are just-in-time compiled. Abstraction programming models, such as Kokkos, can be built on top of some of these programming models (see below).

A HIP compiler supporting the A100 GPUs is still to be installed on Polaris.

Mapping Programming Models to Polaris Modules</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Manually launching a ParaView server on Polaris

Sometimes it is convenient to manually launch an instance of the ParaView server. In this section we will explain an alternative method to run the ParaView server on Polaris using an interactive job, where the user can launch the ParaView server from the command line interface.

Note: this is a method better suited for experienced users. If you are just starting with ParaView, we recommend the client/server mode as your primary method for using this tool.

Setting up ParaView

From your local client select Connect, either from the File menu, or by clicking on the icon circled below:

A new window will open where you can configure a server. Click on Add Server:

Give your server a name, select Client/Server, localhost, and a TCP port (8000 in this example)

Click ""Configure"". In the next window there is an option to set up how ParaView server will be launched, and the default is ""Manual"". Leave it on ""Manual"" and click ""Save"".

You will use these settings when establishing the connection.

Launching the ParaView server on Polaris

You can launch an interactive session on Polaris compute nodes with the following command (adjust parameters as needed to match your allocation, desired number of nodes, queue, walltime, and filesystems):

shell
qsub -l walltime=01:00:00 -l select=2 -A yourallocation -q debug -I -l filesystems=home:grand

When the job starts you will receive a prompt on your head node like this:

username@x3005c0s7b0n0:~>

Make a note of the node hostname (x3005c0s7b0n0 in the example above). You can also get this information from qstat -fx jobID

Now load the ParaView module

username@x3005c0s7b0n0:~> module use /soft/modulefiles 
username@x3005c0s7b0n0:~> module load visualization/paraview/paraview-5.12.0-EGL

and launch the ParaView server with</DOCUMENT>

The default Resolution is set to 100. This will make things a bit cluttered, especially when we start adding in the other data, so let's reduce this to 25

Click the Apply button

6. Streamlines as Tubes

The streamlines are just that, lines. We can use the Tubes filter to represent them as 3D objects, rather than just lines.
- With StreamTracer1selected in the Pipeline Browser, from the main menu select: Filters->Alphabetical->Tube
- In the Object Inspector make sure the Properties tab is selected
- The default value for the Radius is a bit too large for this data, let's set that value to 0
- Click the Apply button
- Notice that the StreamLine1 object has automatically been hidden
- There are many different ways to color these tubes
- With Tubes1 selected, switch to the Display tab in the Object Inspector
- The Color bydropdown lets you choose from a handful of different variables

7. Cutting Planes (Slices)

Now let's add some cutting plans, or slices, to see what the cross-section of the continuum data looks like.
- Again, be sure that the continuum.000*data is selected in the Pipeline Browser
- Filters->Alphabetical->Slice or Click on the Slice icon from the menu bar
- In the Object Inspector make sure the Propertiestab is selected
- At the bottom on the Object Inspector is a section titled Slice Offset Values. Here we can generate values for multiple slices to be made
- First click the Delete All button to remove initial values
- Next, click the New Range button. This will bring up an Add Range dialog box.
- Set the number of Steps to 7. Click OK
- Click the Apply button
- With Slice1 selected in the Object Inspector, switch to the Display tab
- Set Color by value to Velocity

<DOCUMENT>mpi4Jax is a relatively new project and requires setting some environment variables for good performance and usability:
- Set MPI4JAX_USE_CUDA_MPI=1 to use CUDA-Aware MPI, supported in the conda module, to do operations directly from the GPU.
- Set MPICH_GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED=1 to use CUDA-Aware MPI.

The following code, based off of a test script from the mpi4jax repository, can help you verify you are using mpi4jax properly:

```python
import os
from mpi4py import MPI
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
import mpi4jax

comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD
rank = comm.Get_rank()
local_rank = int(os.environ[""PMI_LOCAL_RANK""])

available_devices = jax.devices(""gpu"")
if len(available_devices) <= local_rank:
    raise Exception(""Could not find enough GPUs"")

target_device = available_devices[local_rank]

@jax.jit
def foo(arr):
   arr = arr + rank
   arr_sum, _ = mpi4jax.allreduce(arr, op=MPI.SUM, comm=comm)
   return arr_sum

with jax.default_device(target_device):
    a = jnp.zeros((3, 3))
    print(f""Rank {rank}, local rank {local_rank}, a.device is {a.device()}"")
    result = foo(a)
    print(f""Rank {rank}, local rank {local_rank}, result.device is {result.device()}"")

if rank == 0:
   print(result)

```

JAX and mpi4jax are both still somewhat early in their software lifecycles.  Updates are frequent, and if you require assistance please contact support@alcf.anl.gov.</DOCUMENT>

Context: <DOCUMENT>Controlling Where Your Job Runs

If you wish to have your job run on specific nodes form your select like this: -l select=1:vnode=<node name1>+1:vnode=<node name2>... . Obviously, that gets tedious for large jobs.

If you want to control the location of a few nodes, for example 2 out of 64, but the rest don't matter, you can do something like this: -l select=1:vnode=<node name1>+1:vnode=<node name2>+62:system=foo

Every node has a PBS resource called tier0 with a rack identifier and tier1 with a dragonfly group identifieer.  If you want all your nodes grouped in a rack, you can add the group specifier -l select=8:system=foo,place=scatter:group=tier0.  If you wanted everything in the same dragonfly group, replace tier0 with tier1.  Note that you have to also explicitly specify the place when you use group.  If you wanted a specific rack or dragonfly group instead of any of them, you are back to the select: -l select 10:tier0=x3001-g0.

Network: Rack and Dragonfly Group Mappings

Racks contain (7) 6U chassis; each chassis has 2 nodes for 14 nodes per rack

The hostnames are of the form xRRPPc0sUUb[0|1]n0 where:
RR is the row {30, 31, 32}
PP is the position in the row {30 goes 1-16, 31 and 32 go 1-12}
c is chassis and is always 0
s stands for slot, but in this case is the RU in the rack and values are {1,7,13,19,25,31,37}
b is BMC controller and is 0 or 1 (each node has its own BMC)
n is node, but is always 0 since there is only one node per BMC

So, 16+12+12 = 40 racks * 14 nodes per rack = 560 nodes.

Note that in production group 9 (the last 4 racks) will be the designated on-demand racks

The management racks are x3000 and X3100 and are dragonfly group 10

The TDS rack is x3200 and is dragonfly group 11</DOCUMENT>

<DOCUMENT>GNU Compilers on Polaris

The GNU compilers are available on Polaris via the PrgEnv-gnu and gcc-mixed modules. The gcc-mixed module can be useful when, for example, the PrgEnv-nvhpc compilers are used to compile C/C++ MPI-enabled code and gfortran is needed.

The GNU compilers currently on Polaris do not support GPU code generation and thus can only be used for compiling CPU codes.

The nvhpc and llvm compilers can be used for compiling GPU-enabled applications.</DOCUMENT>

Waiting for client...
Connection URL: cs://x3005c0s7b0n0:8000
Accepting connection(s): x3005c0s7b0n0:8000

In this case pvserver will be listening on TCP port 8000 of your head node. You can change this port if you want.

Creating a tunnel over ssh

We need to establish an ssh tunnel to connect client to server. On your local machine open a new terminal and type:

ssh -v -N -L 8000:x3005c0s7b0n0:8000 polaris.alcf.anl.gov

where 8000 is a TCP port and x3005c0s7b0n0 the name of your head node. Adjust these values accordingly.

Among multiple lines with debug information,  you should see something like:

debug1: Local connections to LOCALHOST:8000 forwarded to remote address x3005c0s7b0n0:8000

Keep this terminal open for the duration of your session to keep the ssh tunnel active.

Now you are ready to launch your ParaView client locally. Keep in mind that client and servers versions must match. The ParaView version currently deployed on Polaris is 5.12.0

Connecting to ParaView server

Connect your ParaView client to the server configuration you created above. You can select Connect, either from the File menu, or the icon circled in the figure:

and selecting the configuration you created in a previous step.

The connection should point to:

Horovod and DDP work best when you limit the visible devices to only one GPU.  Note that if you import mpi4py or horovod, and then do something like os.environ[""CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES""] = hvd.local_rank(), it may not actually work!  You must set the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable prior to doing MPI.COMM_WORLD.init(), which is done in horovod.init() as well as implicitly in from mpi4py import MPI.   On Polaris specifically, you can use the environment variable PMI_LOCAL_RANK (as well as PMI_LOCAL_SIZE) to learn information about the node-local MPI ranks.

DeepSpeed

DeepSpeed is also available and usable on Polaris.  For more information, please see the DeepSpeed documentation directly.

PyTorch DataLoader and multi-node Horovod

Please note there is a bug that causes a hang when using PyTorch's multithreaded data loaders with distributed training across multiple nodes. To workaround this, NVIDIA recommends setting num_workers=0 in the dataloader configuration, which serializes data loading.

Context: <DOCUMENT>PyTorch on Polaris

PyTorch is a popular, open source deep learning framework developed and released by Facebook.  The PyTorch home page has more information about PyTorch, which you can refer to.  For trouble shooting on Polaris, please contact support@alcf.anl.gov.

Installation on Polaris

PyTorch is installed on Polaris already, available in the conda module.  To use it from a compute node, please do:

bash
module load conda
conda activate

Then, you can load PyTorch in python as usual (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):

```python

import torch
torch.version
'1.12.0a0+git67ece03'

```

This installation of PyTorch was built from source and the cuda libraries it uses are found via the CUDA_HOME environment variable (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):

bash
$ echo $CUDA_HOME
/soft/datascience/cuda/cuda_11.5.2_495.29.05_linux

If you need to build applications that use this version of PyTorch and CUDA, we recommend using these cuda libraries to ensure compatibility.  We periodically update the PyTorch release, though updates will come in the form of new versions of the conda module.

PyTorch is also available through nvidia containers that have been translated to Singularity containers.  For more information about containers, please see the containers documentation page.

PyTorch Best Practices on Polaris

Single Node Performance

When running PyTorch applications, we have found the following practices to be generally, if not universally, useful and encourage you to try some of these techniques to boost performance of your own applications.</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Gateway nodes

There are 50 gateway nodes.  These nodes are not user accessible, but are used transparently for access to the storage systems.  Each node has a single 200 Gbps HDR IB card for access to the storage area network.  This gives a theoretical peak bandwidth of 1250 GB/s which is approximately the aggregate bandwidth of the global file systems (1300 GB/s).

Storage

Polaris has access to the ALCF global file systems.  Details on storage can be found here.</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>and launch the ParaView server with

srizzi@x3005c0s7b0n0:~> mpirun -n 8 pvserver --server-port=8000
Waiting for client...
Connection URL: cs://x3005c0s7b0n0:8000
Accepting connection(s): x3005c0s7b0n0:8000

In this case pvserver will be listening on TCP port 8000 of your head node. You can change this port if you want.

Creating a tunnel over ssh

We need to establish an ssh tunnel to connect client to server. On your local machine open a new terminal and type:

ssh -v -N -L 8000:x3005c0s7b0n0:8000 polaris.alcf.anl.gov

where 8000 is a TCP port and x3005c0s7b0n0 the name of your head node. Adjust these values accordingly.

Among multiple lines with debug information,  you should see something like:

debug1: Local connections to LOCALHOST:8000 forwarded to remote address x3005c0s7b0n0:8000

Keep this terminal open for the duration of your session to keep the ssh tunnel active.

Now you are ready to launch your ParaView client locally. Keep in mind that client and servers versions must match. The ParaView version currently deployed on Polaris is 5.12.0

Connecting to ParaView server

Connect your ParaView client to the server configuration you created above. You can select Connect, either from the File menu, or the icon circled in the figure:

and selecting the configuration you created in a previous step.

The connection should point to:

localhost:8000

In the terminal where you launched the server you will see now that the connection is established. Note that ParaView may take a few seconds to connect. This is normal behavior.

username@x3005c0s7b0n0:~> mpirun -n 8 pvserver --server-port=8000
Waiting for client...
Connection URL: cs://x3005c0s7b0n0:8000
Accepting connection(s): x3005c0s7b0n0:8000
Client connected.

At this point you can use ParaView normally.</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>NVIDIA Compilers on Polaris

The NVIDIA compilers (nvc, nvc++, nvcc, and nvfortran) are available on Polaris via the PrgEnv-nvhpc and nvhpc modules. There is currently a PrgEnv-nvidia module available, but that will soon be deprecated in Cray's PE, thus it is not recommend for use.

The Cray compiler wrappers map to NVIDIA compilers as follows.

cc -> nvc
CC -> nvc++
ftn -> nvfortran

Users are encouraged to look through NVIDIA's documentation for the NVHPC SDK and specific information on the compilers, tools, and libraries.

Notes on NVIDIA Compilers

PGI compilers

The NVIDIA programming environments makes available compilers from the NVIDIA HPC SDK. While the PGI compilers are available in this programming environment, it should be noted they are actually symlinks to the corresponding NVIDIA compilers.
pgcc -> nvc
pgc++ -> nvc++
pgf90 -> nvfortran
pgfortran -> nvfortran
While nvcc is the traditional CUDA C and CUDA C++ compiler for NVIDIA GPUs, the nvc, nvc++, and nvfortran compilers additionally target CPUs.

NVHPC SDK Directory Structure

Users migrating from CUDA toolkits to the NVHPC SDK may find it beneficial to review the directory structure of the hpc-sdk directory to find the location of commonly used libraries (including math libraries for the CPU). With the PrgEnv-nvhpc module loaded, the NVIDIA_PATH environment variable can be used to locate the path to various NVIDIA tools, libraries, and examples.

compiler/bin - cuda-gdb, ncu, nsys, ...

examples - CUDA-Fortran, OpenMP, ...

comm_libs - nccl, nvshmem, ...

compiler/libs - blas, lapack, ...

cuda/lib64 - cudart, OpenCL, ...

math_libs/lib64 - cublas, cufft, ...

Context: <DOCUMENT>FFmpeg on Polaris

NOTE: FFmpeg module is currently missing on Polaris after a recent upgrade. A spack build of ffmpeg will be available soon

To use FFmpeg on Polaris first load the corresponding module:

module load ffmpeg

This is a typical command line to create a movie from a series of snapshots in PNG format:

ffmpeg -r 15 -i frames.%03d.png -r 25 -pix_fmt yuv420p movie.mp4

where:

r 15 is the input frame rate. Experiment with values smaller than the output frame rate for longer movies.
-r 25 is the output frame rate (use this value for standard 25 frames per second)
-i frames.%03d.png reads the input frames in sequence
-pix_fmt yuv420p is needed for movies to play in browsers
movie.mp4 is the resulting movie</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>math_libs/lib64 - cublas, cufft, ...

Differences between nvcc and nvc/nvc++

For users that want to continue using nvcc it is important to be mindful of differences with the newer nvc and nvc++ compilers. For example, the -cuda flag instructs nvcc to compile .cu input files to .cu.cpp.ii output files which are to be separately compiled, whereas the same -cuda flag instructs nvc, nvc++, and nvfortran to enable CUDA C/C++ or CUDA Fortran code generation. The resulting output file in each case is different (text vs. object) and one may see unrecognized format error when -cuda is incorrectly passed to nvcc.

Known Issues and Workarounds

If you are using nvcc to invoke nvc++ and compiling C++17 code, and are seeing the following warning and unable to compile C++17 constructs:

```
polaris-login-01(~)> nvcc --std=c++17 -ccbin nvc++ ~/smalltests/bool_constant.cpp
nvcc warning : The -std=c++17 flag is not supported with the configured host compiler. Flag will be ignored.
""/home/zippy/smalltests/bool_constant.cpp"", line 10: error: namespace ""std"" has no member class ""bool_constant""
      : std::bool_constant<(UnaryPred::value || ...)> {};

2 errors detected in the compilation of ""/home/zippy/smalltests/bool_constant.cpp"".

```

you will need to work around it by loading the latest cudatoolkit module atop PrgEnv-nvhpc:

module load cudatoolkit-standalone/11.6.2</DOCUMENT>

if len(available_devices) <= local_rank:
    raise Exception(""Could not find enough GPUs"")

target_device = available_devices[local_rank]

@jax.jit
def foo(arr):
   arr = arr + rank
   arr_sum, _ = mpi4jax.allreduce(arr, op=MPI.SUM, comm=comm)

The specification describes directives, runtime routines, and environment variables that allow an application developer to express parallelism (e.g. shared memory multiprocessing and device offloading). Many compiler vendors provide implementations of the OpenMP specification (https://www.openmp.org/specifications).

Setting the environment to use OpenMP on Polaris

Many of the programming environments available on Polaris have OpenMP support.

module OpenMP CPU support? OpenMP GPU support? PrgEnv-nvhpc yes yes llvm yes yes PrgEnv-gnu yes no PrgEnv-cray yes yes*

Currently PrgEnv-cray is not recommended for OpenMP offload.

By default, the PrgEnv-nvhpc module is loaded. To switch to other modules, you can use module switch.

Using PrgEnv-nvhpc

This is loaded by default, so there's no need to load additional modules. You can confirm that it is loaded by running module list to check that PrgEnv-nvhpc is in the list.

Using LLVM

To use the LLVM module, load the following.
module load mpiwrappers/cray-mpich-llvm
module load cudatoolkit-standalone

See the the LLVM compiling page here for more information.

Using PrgEnv-gnu

To switch from PrgEnv-nvhpc to PrgEnv-gnu you can run:

module switch PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-gnu

The gcc/gfortran on Polaris was not built with GPU support. To use OpenMP on the CPU, you need to unload craype-accel-nvidia80:

module unload craype-accel-nvidia80

Using PrgEnv-cray

To switch from PrgEnv-nvhpc to PrgEnv-cray you can run:

module switch PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-cray

To use OpenMP on the CPU only, also unload craype-accel-nvidia80:

module unload craype-accel-nvidia80

To use OpenMP on the GPU, load cudatoolkit-standalone, although this is not recommended at the moment.
module load cudatoolkit-standalone

<DOCUMENT>LAMMPS

Overview

LAMMPS is a general-purpose molecular dynamics software package for massively parallel computers. It is written in an exceptionally clean style that makes it one of the more popular codes for users to extend and it currently has dozens of user-developed extensions.

For details about the code and its usage, see the LAMMPS home page. This page provides information specific to running on Polaris at the ALCF.

Using LAMMPS at ALCF

ALCF provides assistance with build instructions, compiling executables, submitting jobs, and providing prebuilt binaries (upon request). A collection of Makefiles and submission scripts are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo here. For questions, contact us at support@alcf.anl.gov.

How to Obtain the Code

LAMMPS is an open-source code, which can be downloaded from the LAMMPS website.

Building on Polaris

After LAMMPS has been downloaded and unpacked on an ALCF filesystem, users should see a directory whose name is of the form lammps-<version>. One should then see the Makefile lammps-<version>/src/MAKE/MACHINES/Makefile.polaris in recent versions that can be used as a starting point for compilation on Polaris. Copies of Makefiles for building with the GPU/KOKKOS package using CUDA for GPU support with the GNU/NVHPC compiler are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo here. For older versions of LAMMPS, you may need to take an existing Makefile (e.g. Makefile.mpi) for your specific version of LAMMPS and edit the top portion appropratiately to create a new Makefile.polaris.

KOKKOS package and GNU compilers

The following modules are useful for this particular build. Note, the cmake module is not required if using the GNU Makefile procedure to build LAMMPS. The initial module restore is just setting the default environment as the starting point. Users may find it useful to copy these module commands into a small helper script to assist with compiling and running LAMMPS (e.g. setup_lammps_gnu.sh).</DOCUMENT>

For further details regarding the arguments passed to mpiexec command shown above, please visit the Job Scheduling and Execution section. A simple example describing the details and execution of the set_affinity_gpu_polaris.sh file can be found here.

Note: By default, there is no GPU-aware MPI library linking support.  The example above shows how the user can enable the linking by specifying the path to the GTL (GPU Transport Layer) library (libmpi_gtl_cuda) to the link line.

oneAPI Math Kernel Library (oneMKL) Interfaces

oneMKL Interfaces is an open-source implementation of the oneMKL Data Parallel C++ (DPC++) interface according to the oneMKL specification. It works with multiple devices (backends) using device-specific libraries underneath.

oneMKL is part of oneAPI. Various backend supported are shown below. More Information here.

User Application Third-Party Library cuBLAS oneMKL interface cuSOLVER cuRAND

Example (using onemkl::gemm)

The following snippet shows how to compile and run a SYCL code with oneMKL library. For instance, a GPU-based GEMM is performed using mkl::gemm API and the results are compared to a CPU-based GEMM performed using the traditional blas (e.g., AOCL-BLIS) library.
```c++

<DOCUMENT>In case you want write portable GPU kernels we highly recommend the KernelAbstractions.jl package. It provides a high-level abstraction for writing GPU kernels that can be compiled for different GPU backends.

julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(""KernelAbstractions"")'

By loading either oneAPI.jl, AMDGPU.jl, or CUDA.jl (see quickstart guide below).

CUDA-aware MPI

MPI.jl supports CUDA-aware MPI. This is enabled by setting the following environment variables.

bash
export JULIA_CUDA_MEMORY_POOL=none
export MPICH_GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED=1
export JULIA_MPI_PATH=${CRAY_MPICH_DIR}
export JULIA_MPI_HAS_CUDA=1

Note that MPI.jl needs to be rebuilt for the changes to take effect.

bash
julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.build(""MPI"")'

HDF5 Support

Parallel HDF5 support is provided by
module load cray-hdf5-parallel
After setting export JULIA_HDF5_PATH=$HDF5_DIR we can install the HDF5.jl package.

julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(""HDF5"")'

To remove warning messages indicating that use of JULIA_HDF5_PATH has been deprecated, one can use the following command to set the HDF5 libraries.

```
$ echo $CRAY_HDF5_PARALLEL_PREFIX/
/opt/cray/pe/hdf5-parallel/1.12.2.9/nvidia/23.3

$ julia --project -e 'using HDF5; HDF5.API.set_libraries!(""/opt/cray/pe/hdf5-parallel/1.12.2.9/nvidia/23.3/lib/libhdf5.so"", ""/opt/cray/pe/hdf5-parallel/1.12.2.9/nvidia/23.3/lib/libhdf5_hl.so"")'
```

Quickstart Guide

The following example shows how to use MPI.jl, CUDA.jl, and HDF5.jl to write a
parallel program that computes the sum of two vectors on the GPU and writes the
result to an HDF5 file. A repository with an example code computing an
approximation of pi can be found at
Polaris.jl. In this repository, you will also find
a setup_polaris.sh script that will build the HDF5.jl and MPI.jl package for the system libraries.
The dependencies are installed with the following commands:

Context: <DOCUMENT>Julia

Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for
technical computing. It has a syntax familiar to users of many other
technical computing environments. Designed at MIT to tackle large-scale
partial-differential equation simulation and distributed linear algebra, Julia
features a robust ecosystem of tools for
optimization,
statistics, parallel programming, and data
visualization. Julia is actively developed by the Julia
Labs team at MIT and in
industry, along with hundreds of domain-expert
scientists and programmers worldwide.

Contributing

This guide is a first draft of the Julia documentation for Polaris. If you have any
suggestions or contributions, please open a pull request or contact us by
opening a ticket at the ALCF Helpdesk.

Julia Installation

We encourage users interested in using Julia on Polaris to install in their home or project directories at this time. Using the official Julia 1.9 binaries from the Julia
webpage is recommended.
Juliaup provides a convenient way to
install Julia and manage the various Julia versions. The default installation will install julia, juliaup, and other commands in a ${HOME}/.julia directory and update profile files like .bashrc to update PATH to include that directory. One can customize the installation to change these defaults.

bash
module load craype-accel-nvidia80
curl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh

If you chose a custom installation, then be sure to update the PATH environment variable appropriately.

export PATH=${HOME}/.juliaup/bin:${PATH}

You may then list the available Julia versions with juliaup list and install a
specific version with juliaup install <version>. You can then activate a
specific version with juliaup use <version> and set the default version with
juliaup default <version>. juliaup update will update the installed Julia
versions. In general, the latest stable release of Julia should be used.

bash
juliaup add release

<DOCUMENT>Compiling and Linking Overview on Polaris

Compiling on Polaris Login and Compute Nodes

If your build system does not require GPUs for the build process, as is usually the case, compilation of GPU-accelerated codes is generally expected to work well on the Polaris login nodes. If your build system does require GPUs, you cannot yet compile on the Polaris login nodes, as they do not currently have GPUs installed. You may in this case compile your applications on the Polaris compute nodes. Do this by submitting an interactive single-node job, or running your build system in a batch job.

Home File System

Is it helpful to realize that there is a single HOME filesystem for users that can be accessed from the login and computes of each production resource at ALCF. Thus, users should be mindful of modifications to their environments (e.g. .bashrc) that may cause issues to arise due to differences between the systems.

Cray Programming Environment

The Cray Programming Environment (PE) uses three compiler wrappers for building software. These compiler wrappers should be used when building MPI-enabled applications.

cc - C compiler

CC - C++ compiler

ftn - Fortran compiler

Each of these wrappers can select a specific vendor compiler based on the PrgEnv module loaded in the environment. The following are some helpful options to understand what the compiler wrapper is invoking.

--craype-verbose : Print the command which is forwarded to the compiler invocation

--cray-print-opts=libs : Print library information

--cray-print-opts=cflags : Print include information

The output from these commands may be useful in build scripts where a compiler other than that invoked by a compiler wrapper is desired. Defining some variables as such may prove useful in those situations.
CRAY_CFLAGS=$(cc --cray-print-opts=cflags)
CRAY_LIB=$(cc --cray-print-opts=libs)
Further documentation and options are available via man cc and similar.

!!! danger

With the conda environment setup, one can install common Python modules using
#!bash python3 pip install --users '<module-name>' which will install
packages in #!bash $PYTHONUSERBASE/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages.

The #!bash $PYTHONUSERBASE environment variable is automatically set when you
load the base conda module, and is equal to  #!bash
/home/$USER/.local/polaris/conda/YYYY-MM-DD.

Note, Python modules installed this way that contain command line binaries will
not have those binaries automatically added to the shell's #!bash $PATH. To
manually add the path:

bash
export PATH=""$PYTHONUSERBASE/bin:$PATH""

Be sure to remove this location from #!bash $PATH if you deactivate the base
Anaconda environment or unload the module.

Cloning the Anaconda environment, or using venv are both more flexible and
transparent when compared to #!bash --user installs.</DOCUMENT>

<DOCUMENT>Use Reduced Precision. Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with PyTorch operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the PyTorch Automatic Mixed Precision package (AMP), as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  In PyTorch, users generally need to manage casting and loss scaling manually,  though context managers and function decorators can provide easy tools to do this.

PyTorch has a JIT module as well as backends to support op fusion, similar to TensorFlow's tf.function tools.  However, PyTorch JIT capabilities are newer and may not yield performance improvements.  Please see TorchScript for more information.

Multi-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up

PyTorch is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with PyTorch has been seen with both DDP and Horovod.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation or the Distributed Data Parallel documentation.  Some Polaris-specific details that may be helpful to you:

CPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.  In particular, we encourage users to try their scaling measurements with the following settings:

Set the environment variable NCCL_COLLNET_ENABLE=1

Set the environment varialbe NCCL_NET_GDR_LEVEL=PHB

Context: <DOCUMENT>Mapping Programming Models to Polaris Modules

The table below offers some suggestions for how to get started setting up your environment on Polaris depending on the programming language and model. Note, mixed C/C++ and Fortran applications should choose the programming environment for the Fortran compiler because of mpi.mod and similar incompatibilities between Fortran-generated files from different compilers. Several simple examples for testing the software environment on Polaris for different programming models are available in the ALCF GettingStart repo.

Note, users are encouraged to use PrgEnv-nvhpc instead of PrgEnv-nvidia as the latter will soon be deprecated in Cray's PE. They are otherwise identical pointing to compilers from the same NVIDIA SDK version.

<DOCUMENT>Manually launching a ParaView server on Polaris

Sometimes it is convenient to manually launch an instance of the ParaView server. In this section we will explain an alternative method to run the ParaView server on Polaris using an interactive job, where the user can launch the ParaView server from the command line interface.

Note: this is a method better suited for experienced users. If you are just starting with ParaView, we recommend the client/server mode as your primary method for using this tool.

Setting up ParaView

From your local client select Connect, either from the File menu, or by clicking on the icon circled below:

A new window will open where you can configure a server. Click on Add Server:

Give your server a name, select Client/Server, localhost, and a TCP port (8000 in this example)

Click ""Configure"". In the next window there is an option to set up how ParaView server will be launched, and the default is ""Manual"". Leave it on ""Manual"" and click ""Save"".

You will use these settings when establishing the connection.

Launching the ParaView server on Polaris

You can launch an interactive session on Polaris compute nodes with the following command (adjust parameters as needed to match your allocation, desired number of nodes, queue, walltime, and filesystems):

shell
qsub -l walltime=01:00:00 -l select=2 -A yourallocation -q debug -I -l filesystems=home:grand

When the job starts you will receive a prompt on your head node like this:

username@x3005c0s7b0n0:~>

Make a note of the node hostname (x3005c0s7b0n0 in the example above). You can also get this information from qstat -fx jobID

Now load the ParaView module

username@x3005c0s7b0n0:~> module use /soft/modulefiles 
username@x3005c0s7b0n0:~> module load visualization/paraview/paraview-5.12.0-EGL

and launch the ParaView server with</DOCUMENT>

Context: <DOCUMENT>LLVM Compilers on Polaris

This page is not about LLVM-based Cray Compiling Environment (CCE) compilers from PrgEnv-cray but about open source LLVM compilers.

If LLVM compilers are needed without MPI support, simply load the llvm module.

Cray Programming Environment does not offer LLVM compiler support.
Thus cc/CC/ftn compiler wrappers using LLVM compilers currently are not available.
To use Clang with MPI, one can load the mpiwrappers/cray-mpich-llvm module which loads the following modules.

llvm, upstream llvm compilers

cray-mpich, MPI compiler wrappers mpicc/mpicxx/mpif90. mpif90 uses gfortran because flang is not ready for production use.

cray-pals, MPI launchers mpiexec/aprun/mpirun

Limitation There is no GPU-aware MPI library linking support by default. If needed, users should manually add the GTL (GPU Transport Layer) library to the application link line.

Update 04/25/2024 To access LLVM modules, module use /soft/modulefiles is required.

OpenMP offload

When targeting the OpenMP or CUDA programming models for GPUs, the cudatoolkit-standalone module should also be loaded.</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>8. Data Representation: Opacity

Even with the continuum data represented as wireframe, there is still considerable occlusion of the interior structures. In order to further reduce this occlusion by the wireframe, we can make it more transparent.

Again, be sure that the continuum.000*data is selected in the Pipeline Browser

In the Object Inspector make sure the Display tab is selected

In the Object Inspector there is a section titled Style

Set Opacity to 0.2

9. Animating Simulation Data

Since our data has multiple time steps, we can easily animate through them to see how the data changes over time.

Simply click the Play button on the animation bar at the top of the GUI

Pause to make it stop

Loop: With this button toggled on, animation will repeat until stopped

10. Animations

Animations can be saved to disk as a movie file, to be played back later.

From the main menu: File->Save Animation

Animation Settings Dialog: Save Animation

Files of type: AVI files (*.avi)

Enter a name in File name:

Click OK

Movie can be played back with standard media players (Windows Media Player, QuickTime, VLC, etc.)

11. Particles as Glyphs

Glyphs are another way of visually representing data where the attributes of a graphical element are dictated by attributes of the data.

All of the particles are displayed as red points in the graphics window. There are ~39K particles in this particular data set, which makes the display a bit cluttered. In order to both filter some of these out, and create 3D representations for them, let's apply a glyph filter to this data.

Now let's add some of our other data back into the scene. Let's start with the particle data.

All of the particles are displayed as red points in the graphics window. There are ~39K particles in this particular data set, which makes the display rather cluttered. In order to both filter some of these out, and create 3D representations for them, we will apply the glyph filter to this data.</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>GNU Compilers on Polaris

The GNU compilers are available on Polaris via the PrgEnv-gnu and gcc-mixed modules. The gcc-mixed module can be useful when, for example, the PrgEnv-nvhpc compilers are used to compile C/C++ MPI-enabled code and gfortran is needed.

The GNU compilers currently on Polaris do not support GPU code generation and thus can only be used for compiling CPU codes.

The nvhpc and llvm compilers can be used for compiling GPU-enabled applications.</DOCUMENT>

SmartSim is an open source tool developed by the Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) designed to facilitate the integration of traditional HPC simulation applications with machine learning workflows.
There are two core components to SmartSim:

Infrastructure library (IL)
Provides API to start, stop and monitor HPC applications from Python
Interfaces with the scheduler launch jobs (PBSPro on Polaris and Cobalt on Theta/ThetaGPU)
Deploys a distributed in-memory database called the Orchestrator

SmartRedis client library
Provides clients that connect to the Orchestrator from Fortran, C, C++, Python code
The client API library enables data transfer to/from database and ability to load and run JIT-traced Python and ML runtimes acting on stored data

<DOCUMENT>Programming Models on Polaris

The software environment on Polaris supports several parallel programming models targeting the CPUs and GPUs.

CPU Parallel Programming Models

The Cray compiler wrappers cc, CC, and ftn are recommended for MPI applications as they provide the needed include paths and libraries for each programming environment. A summary of available CPU parallel programming models and relevant compiler flags is shown below. Users are encouraged to review the corresponding man pages and documentation.

Programming Model GNU NVHPC LLVM OpenMP -fopenmp -mp -fopenmp OpenACC -- -acc=multicore --

Higher-level programming models such as Kokkos and Raja may also be used for CPU programming.

GPU Programming Models

A summary of available GPU programming models and relevant compiler flags is shown below for compilers that generate offloadable code. Users are encouraged to review the corresponding man pages and documentation.

Programming Model GNU NVHPC LLVM ONEAPI CUDA -- -cuda [-gpu=cuda8.0,cc11.0] -- -- HIP* -- -- -- -- OpenACC -- -acc -- -- OpenCL* -- -- -- -- OpenMP -- -mp=gpu -fopenmp-targets=nvptx64 -- SYCL -- -- -- -fsycl -fsycl-targets=nvptx64-nvidia-cuda -Xsycl-target-backend --cuda-gpu-arch=sm_80

Note, the llvm and oneapi modules are provided by ALCF to complement the compilers provided by the Cray PE on Polaris.

Higher-level programming models such as Kokkos and Raja may also be used for GPU programming.

OpenCL is supported, but does not require specific compiler flags per-se as the offloaded kernels are just-in-time compiled. Abstraction programming models, such as Kokkos, can be built on top of some of these programming models (see below).

A HIP compiler supporting the A100 GPUs is still to be installed on Polaris.

We strongly suggest that users try combinations of different numbers of nodes, MPI ranks per node, number of GPU tasks/devices, GPU task decomposition between nonbonded and PME kernels, and OMP threads per rank to find the optimal throughput for their particular workload.</DOCUMENT>

You can find the latest prebuilt Nvidia PyTorch containers here.  The Tensorflow containers are here (though note that LCF doesn't prebuild the TF-1 containers typically).  You can search the full container registry here. For custom containers tailored for Polaris, visit ALCF's GitHub container registry

Note: Currently container build and executions are only supported on the Polaris compute nodes

Recipe-Based Container Building

As mentioned earlier, you can build Apptainer containers from recipe files. Instructions are available here. See available containers for more recipes.

Note: You can also build custom recipes by bootstrapping from prebuilt images. For e.g the first two lines in a recipe to use our custom Tensorflow implementation would be Bootstrap: oras followed by From: ghcr.io/argonne-lcf/tf2-mpich-nvidia-gpu:latest

Running Containers on Polaris

To run a container on Polaris you can use the submission script described here. Below is an explanation of the job submission script.

```bash

!/bin/sh

PBS -l select=2:system=polaris

PBS -q debug

PBS -l place=scatter

PBS -l walltime=0:30:00

PBS -l filesystems=home:grand

PBS -A

cd ${PBS_O_WORKDIR}
echo $CONTAINER
```

We move to current working directory and enable network access at run time by setting the proxy. We also load apptainer.

```bash

<DOCUMENT>Containers on Polaris

Polaris, powered by NVIDIA A100 GPUs, benefits from container-based workloads for seamless compatibility across NVIDIA systems. This guide details the use of containers on Polaris, including custom container creation, large-scale execution, and common pitfalls.

Apptainer Setup

Polaris employs Apptainer (formerly known as Singularity) for container management. To set up Apptainer, run:

bash
module use /soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/install/modulefiles/Core
module load apptainer
apptainer version #1.2.2

The Apptainer version on Polaris is 1.2.2. Detailed user documentation is available here

Building from Docker or Argonne GitHub Container Registry

Containers on Polaris can be built by writing Dockerfiles on a local machine and then publish the container to DockerHub, or by directly building them on ALCF compute node by writing an Apptainer recipe file. If you prefer to use existing containers, you can pull them from various registries like DockerHub and run them on Polaris.

Since Docker requires root privileges, which users do not have on Polaris, existing Docker containers must be converted to Apptainer. To build a Docker-based container on Polaris, use the following as an example:</DOCUMENT>

<DOCUMENT>Example Programs and Makefiles for Polaris

Several simple examples of building CPU and GPU-enabled codes on Polaris are available in the ALCF GettingStart repo for several programming models. If build your application is problematic for some reason (e.g. absence of a GPU), then users are encouraged to build and test applications directly on one of the Polaris compute nodes via an interactive job. The discussion below makes use of the NVHPC compilers in the default environment as illustrative examples. Similar examples for other compilers on Polaris are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo.

CPU MPI+OpenMP Example

One of the first useful tasks with any new machine, scheduler, and job launcher is to ensure one is binding MPI ranks and OpenMP threads to the host cpu as intended. A simple HelloWorld MPI+OpenMP example is available here to get started with.

The application can be straightforwardly compiled using the Cray compiler wrappers.
CC -fopenmp main.cpp -o hello_affinity

The executable hello_affinity can then be launched in a job script (or directly in shell of interactive job) using mpiexec as discussed here.

```

!/bin/sh

PBS -l select=1:system=polaris

PBS -l place=scatter

PBS -l walltime=0:30:00

PBS -l filesystems=home

MPI example w/ 16 MPI ranks per node spread evenly across cores

NNODES=wc -l < $PBS_NODEFILE
NRANKS_PER_NODE=16
NDEPTH=4
NTHREADS=1

NTOTRANKS=$(( NNODES * NRANKS_PER_NODE ))
echo ""NUM_OF_NODES= ${NNODES} TOTAL_NUM_RANKS= ${NTOTRANKS} RANKS_PER_NODE= ${NRANKS_PER_NODE} THREADS_PER_RANK= ${NTHREADS}""

mpiexec -n ${NTOTRANKS} --ppn ${NRANKS_PER_NODE} --depth=${NDEPTH} --cpu-bind depth ./hello_affinity
```

CUDA

Several variants of C/C++ and Fortran CUDA examples are available here that include MPI and multi-gpu examples.

One can use the Cray compiler wrappers to compile GPU-enabled applications as well. This example of simple vector addition uses the NVIDIA compilers.

User: What are some common uses of the `sycl::queue` class in this context?
Assistant: The common uses of the `sycl::queue` class in this context are allocating memory on the device, copying data from host to device, executing kernels, and copying data from device to host.
    "
"System: This is a chat between a user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions based on the context. The assistant should also indicate when the answer cannot be found in the context.
Context: <DOCUMENT>Set the environment variable NCCL_COLLNET_ENABLE=1

Set the environment varialbe NCCL_NET_GDR_LEVEL=PHB

Manually set the CPU affinity via mpiexec, such as with --cpu-bind verbose,list:0,8,16,24

Horovod works best when you limit the visible devices to only one GPU.  Note that if you import mpi4py or horovod, and then do something like os.environ[""CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES""] = hvd.local_rank(), it may not actually work!  You must set the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable prior to doing MPI.COMM_WORLD.init(), which is done in horovod.init() as well as implicitly in from mpi4py import MPI.   On Polaris specifically, you can use the environment variable PMI_LOCAL_RANK (as well as PMI_LOCAL_SIZE) to learn information about the node-local MPI ranks.

<DOCUMENT>Click the Y Axis button to set the seed line to run along the Y axis.

The default Resolution is set to 100. This will make things a bit cluttered, especially when we start adding in the other data, so let's reduce this to 25

Click the Apply button

6. Streamlines as Tubes

The streamlines are just that, lines. We can use the Tubes filter to represent them as 3D objects, rather than just lines.
- With StreamTracer1selected in the Pipeline Browser, from the main menu select: Filters->Alphabetical->Tube
- In the Object Inspector make sure the Properties tab is selected
- The default value for the Radius is a bit too large for this data, let's set that value to 0
- Click the Apply button
- Notice that the StreamLine1 object has automatically been hidden
- There are many different ways to color these tubes
- With Tubes1 selected, switch to the Display tab in the Object Inspector
- The Color bydropdown lets you choose from a handful of different variables

7. Cutting Planes (Slices)

Now let's add some cutting plans, or slices, to see what the cross-section of the continuum data looks like.
- Again, be sure that the continuum.000*data is selected in the Pipeline Browser
- Filters->Alphabetical->Slice or Click on the Slice icon from the menu bar
- In the Object Inspector make sure the Propertiestab is selected
- At the bottom on the Object Inspector is a section titled Slice Offset Values. Here we can generate values for multiple slices to be made
- First click the Delete All button to remove initial values
- Next, click the New Range button. This will bring up an Add Range dialog box.
- Set the number of Steps to 7. Click OK
- Click the Apply button
- With Slice1 selected in the Object Inspector, switch to the Display tab
- Set Color by value to Velocity

8. Data Representation: Opacity</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Building on Polaris

The following table shows what compiler and flags to use with which PrgEnv:

module compiler flags PrgEnv-nvhpc cc/CC/ftn (nvc/nvc++/nvfortran) -mp=gpu -gpu=cc80 llvm mpicc/mpicxx (clang/clang++) -fopenmp -fopenmp-targets=nvptx64-nvidia-cuda PrgEnv-gnu cc/CC/ftn (gcc/g++/gfortran) -fopenmp PrgEnv-cray cc/CC/ftn -fopenmp

For example to compile a simple code hello.cpp:

For PrgEnv-nvhpc, after loading the modules as discussed above we would use:

CC -mp=gpu -gpu=cc80 hello.cpp
ftn -mp=gpu -gpu=cc80 hello.F90

For LLVM, after loading the modules as discussed above:

mpicxx -fopenmp -fopenmp-targets=nvptx64-nvidia-cuda hello.cpp

For PrgEnv-gnu, after loading the modules as discussed above we would use:

CC -fopenmp hello.cpp
ftn -fopenmp hello.F90

For PrgEnv-cray, after loading the modules as discussed above we would use:

CC -fopenmp hello.cpp
ftn -fopenmp hello.F90

Running on Polaris

To run, you can run the produced executable or with mpiexec in a job script, and then submit the script to the Polaris queue, like:

```
$ cat submit.sh

!/bin/sh

PBS -l select=1:system=polaris

PBS -l walltime=0:30:00

PBS -q debug

PBS -A Catalyst

PBS -l filesystems=home:eagle

cd ${PBS_O_WORKDIR}
 mpiexec -n 1 ./executable
$ # submit to the queue:
$ qsub -l select=1:system=polaris -l walltime=0:30:00 -l filesystems=home:eagle -q debug -A Catalyst ./submit.sh
```

In the above, having the PBS options in the script and on the command line is redundant, but we put it there to show both ways of launching. This submits the script to one node in the debug queue on Polaris, requesting 30 min and the eagle and home filesystems. It will charge project Catalyst for the time.

More details for setting up the job script are in Job Scheduling and Execution section.

Example

```
$ cat hello.cpp

Introduction

NVIDIA® Nsight™ Systems provides developers a system-wide visualization of an applications performance. Developers can optimize bottlenecks to scale efficiently across any number or size of CPUs and GPUs on Polaris. For further optimizations to compute kernels developers should use Nsight Compute.

The NVIDIA Nsight Compute is an interactive kernel profiler for CUDA applications. It provides detailed performance metrics and API debugging via a user interface and command line tool.

In addition, the baseline feature of this tool allows users to compare results within the tool. NVIDIA Nsight Compute provides a customizable and data-driven user interface,  metric collection, and can be extended with analysis scripts for post-processing results.

Step-by-step guide

Building a Kokkos Application Using make

Here's an example Makefile:

```

KOKKOS_HOME set via:

module load kokkos

You can look at the first lines of $KOKKOS_HOME/KokkosConfigCommon.cmake to

see the flags used in cmake configuration of the kokkos library build. The

default Kokkos module on Polaris was built with PrgEnv-nvhpc and includes

Serial, OpenMP (threads) and CUDA backends. So you should have that

environment module loaded and include compiler flags for cuda and openmp:

Cray MPI wrapper for C++ and C compilers:

CXX=CC
CC=cc

CPPFLAGS=-cuda -fopenmp
LDFLAGS=

LDFLAGS=$(CPPFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS)
LDLIBS=-L$(KOKKOS_HOME)/lib64 -lkokkoscore -lkokkossimd -lpthread

SRCS=example1.cpp
OBJS=$(subst .cpp,.o,$(SRCS))

all: example1_polaris

example1_polaris: $(OBJS)
        $(CXX) $(LDFLAGS) -o example1_polaris $(OBJS) $(LDLIBS)

example1.o: example1.cpp

clean:
        rm -f $(OBJS)

distclean: clean
        rm -f example1_polaris
```

Configuring Your Own Kokkos Build on Polaris

Here are recommended environment settings and configuration to build your own
kokkos libraries on Polaris:

Environment

To match what was done in the centrally-built kokkos associated with the
modules discussed above, use the programming environment
PrgEnv-gnu, and use the Cray wrapper CC as the C++ compiler. You'll also
need to explicitly load the Cuda toolkit version 12.2.91 as shown:</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Running

The library should select the GPU by default, but selection of the GPUs can be forced via the ONEAPI_DEVICE_SELECTOR
$ ONEAPI_DEVICE_SELECTOR=cuda:gpu ./a.out
or a specific GPU.
$ ONEAPI_DEVICE_SELECTOR=cuda:gpu:3 ./a.out

<DOCUMENT>oneAPI Compilers and Support

The Intel oneAPI compiler and Codeplay plugins for Nvidia GPUs are available on Polaris.
The oneAPI compilers are not enabled under the Cray Programming Environment system but can be used separately.
Two oneAPI variants are provided, the first being a ""release"" version based on Intel's officially released oneAPI toolkit.
Intel Release Notes

!!! note

Components

These are the list of components associated with this module

User Application Component Compilers DPC++ oneMKL Interfaces oneMKL

The other variant being a build from the open-source. This variant will be more up-to-date at the risk of bugs and breakages based on code that has not undergone a full release cycle.
The documentation is located on the SYCL page. Most notable differences being, icx/icpx are the names of C/C++ compilers respectively when using the release version of the module where as clang/clang++ are for open-source variant.

Compile and Link

oneAPI uses the clang (or icx/icpx wrapper) for compiling and linking for the Nvidia A100 SM80 architecture.

<DOCUMENT>Mixed C/C++ & Fortran Applications

For applications consisting of a mix of C/C++ and Fortran that also uses MPI, it is suggested that the programming environment chosen for Fortran be used to build the full application because of mpi.mod (and similar) incompatibilities.

Compiling for GPUs

It is assumed the majority of applications to be built on Polaris will make use of the GPUs. As such, the craype-accel-nvidia80 module is in the default environment. This has the effect of the Cray compiler wrappers adding -gpu to the compiler invocation along with additional include paths and libraries. Additional compilers flags may be needed depending on the compiler and GPU programming model used (e.g. -cuda, -acc, or -mp=gpu).

This module also adds GPU Transport Layer (GTL) libraries to the link-line to support GPU-aware MPI applications.

<DOCUMENT>Balsam

Balsam is a Python-based workflow manager that helps users execute large numbers of jobs, potentially with interjob dependencies, track job outcomes, and manage postprocessing analysis. A Balsam Site runs on a node with access to the job scheduler, where it can submit and monitor jobs. Overall job state is aggregated on the Balsam Server, making job data from all Sites accessible from any individual site (or the user's laptop), via the command-line interface or the Python API. To get information on how to use the command line tool, you can type balsam --help in your shell.

Full documentation for Balsam is available online.

Balsam requires Python 3.7+. To install Balsam on Polaris, first set up a virtual Python environment:

shell
module load conda
conda activate base
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --pre balsam

To use Balsam, users need an account on the Balsam server.  Users can get an account by contacting the ALCF Help Desk.  Once a user has an account, they can login and make a new site.  A Balsam site is a project space for your workflow. You will be prompted to select what machine (Polaris) you are working on when creating a new site:

shell
balsam login
balsam site init -n new-site new-site
cd new-site
balsam site start

See the Balsam documentation for full details.</DOCUMENT>

Introduction

CUDA-GDB is the NVIDIA tool for debugging CUDA applications running on Polaris. CUDA-GDB is an extension to GDB, the GNU Project debugger. The tool provides developers with a mechanism for debugging CUDA applications running on actual hardware. This enables developers to debug applications without the potential variations introduced by simulation and emulation environments.

Step-by-step guide

Debug Compilation

NVCC, the NVIDIA CUDA compiler driver, provides a mechanism for generating the debugging information necessary for CUDA-GDB to work properly. The -g -G option pair must be passed to NVCC when an application is compiled for ease of debugging with CUDA-GDB; for example,
nvcc -g -G foo.cu -o foo
Using this line to compile the CUDA application foo.cu
* forces -O0 compilation, with the exception of very limited dead-code eliminations and register-spilling optimizations.
* makes the compiler include debug information in the executable

Running CUDA-gdb on Polaris compute nodes

Start an interactive job mode on Polaris as follows:

```
$ qsub -I -l select=1 -l walltime=1:00:00

$ cuda-gdb --version

Login nodes

There are four login nodes available to users for editing code, building code, submitting / monitoring jobs, checking usage (sbank), etc..  Their full hostnames are polaris-login-N.hsn.cm.polaris.alcf.anl.gov  for N equal to 01 through 04; there are an additional two login nodes that are not user-accessible which are used for running services such as JupyterHub. The various compilers and libraries are present on the logins, so most users should be able to build their code.  However, if your build requires the physical presence of the GPU, you will need to build on a compute node.

All users share the same login nodes so please be courteous and respectful of your fellow users.  For example, please do not run computationally or IO intensive pre- or post-processing on the logins and keep the parallelism of your builds to a reasonable level.

<DOCUMENT>Compiling and Linking Overview on Polaris

Compiling on Polaris Login and Compute Nodes

If your build system does not require GPUs for the build process, as is usually the case, compilation of GPU-accelerated codes is generally expected to work well on the Polaris login nodes. If your build system does require GPUs, you cannot yet compile on the Polaris login nodes, as they do not currently have GPUs installed. You may in this case compile your applications on the Polaris compute nodes. Do this by submitting an interactive single-node job, or running your build system in a batch job.

Home File System

Is it helpful to realize that there is a single HOME filesystem for users that can be accessed from the login and computes of each production resource at ALCF. Thus, users should be mindful of modifications to their environments (e.g. .bashrc) that may cause issues to arise due to differences between the systems.

Cray Programming Environment

The Cray Programming Environment (PE) uses three compiler wrappers for building software. These compiler wrappers should be used when building MPI-enabled applications.

cc - C compiler

CC - C++ compiler

ftn - Fortran compiler

Each of these wrappers can select a specific vendor compiler based on the PrgEnv module loaded in the environment. The following are some helpful options to understand what the compiler wrapper is invoking.

--craype-verbose : Print the command which is forwarded to the compiler invocation

--cray-print-opts=libs : Print library information

--cray-print-opts=cflags : Print include information

The output from these commands may be useful in build scripts where a compiler other than that invoked by a compiler wrapper is desired. Defining some variables as such may prove useful in those situations.
CRAY_CFLAGS=$(cc --cray-print-opts=cflags)
CRAY_LIB=$(cc --cray-print-opts=libs)
Further documentation and options are available via man cc and similar.

Compilers provided by Cray Programming Environments</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Programming Models on Polaris

The software environment on Polaris supports several parallel programming models targeting the CPUs and GPUs.

CPU Parallel Programming Models

The Cray compiler wrappers cc, CC, and ftn are recommended for MPI applications as they provide the needed include paths and libraries for each programming environment. A summary of available CPU parallel programming models and relevant compiler flags is shown below. Users are encouraged to review the corresponding man pages and documentation.

Programming Model GNU NVHPC LLVM OpenMP -fopenmp -mp -fopenmp OpenACC -- -acc=multicore --

Higher-level programming models such as Kokkos and Raja may also be used for CPU programming.

GPU Programming Models

A summary of available GPU programming models and relevant compiler flags is shown below for compilers that generate offloadable code. Users are encouraged to review the corresponding man pages and documentation.

Programming Model GNU NVHPC LLVM ONEAPI CUDA -- -cuda [-gpu=cuda8.0,cc11.0] -- -- HIP* -- -- -- -- OpenACC -- -acc -- -- OpenCL* -- -- -- -- OpenMP -- -mp=gpu -fopenmp-targets=nvptx64 -- SYCL -- -- -- -fsycl -fsycl-targets=nvptx64-nvidia-cuda -Xsycl-target-backend --cuda-gpu-arch=sm_80

Note, the llvm and oneapi modules are provided by ALCF to complement the compilers provided by the Cray PE on Polaris.

Higher-level programming models such as Kokkos and Raja may also be used for GPU programming.

OpenCL is supported, but does not require specific compiler flags per-se as the offloaded kernels are just-in-time compiled. Abstraction programming models, such as Kokkos, can be built on top of some of these programming models (see below).

A HIP compiler supporting the A100 GPUs is still to be installed on Polaris.

Mapping Programming Models to Polaris Modules</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>['Running Multiple MPI Applications on a node\n\nMultiple applications can be run simultaneously on a node by launching several mpiexec commands and backgrounding them. For performance, it will likely be necessary to ensure that each application runs on a distinct set of CPU resources and/or targets specific GPUs. One can provide a list of CPUs using the --cpu-bind option, which when combined with CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES provides a user with specifying exactly which CPU and GPU resources to run each application on. In the example below, four instances of the application are simultaneously running on a single node. In the first instance, the application is spawning MPI ranks 0-7 on CPUs 24-31 and using GPU 0. This mapping is based on output from the nvidia-smi topo -m command and pairs CPUs with the closest GPU.\n\n```bash\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:24:25:26:27:28:29:30:31 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:16:17:18:19:20:21:22:23 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:8:9:10:11:12:13:14:15 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=3\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:0:1:2:3:4:5:6:7 ./hello_affinity &\n\nwait\n```\n\nCompute Node Access to the Internet\n\nCurrently, the only access the internet is via a proxy.  Here are the proxy environment variables for Polaris:\n\nbash\nexport http_proxy=""http://proxy.alcf.anl.gov:3128""\nexport https_proxy=""http://proxy.alcf.anl.gov:3128""\nexport ftp_proxy=""http://proxy.alcf.anl.gov:3128""\n\nIn the future, though we don\'t have a timeline on this because it depends on future features in slingshot and internal software development, we intend to have public IP addresses be a schedulable resource.  For instance, if only your head node needed public access your select statement might looks something like: -l select=1:pubnet=True+63.\n\nControlling Where Your Job Runs', 'data/md/polaris/running-jobs.md']</DOCUMENT>

User: What compiler flags do I use with PrgEnv-nvhpc?
Assistant: To use compiler flags with PrgEnv-nvhpc, you would use `cc/CC/ftn (nvc/nvc++/nvfortran) -mp=gpu -gpu=cc80`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The context states that for PrgEnv-nvhpc, we need to use `cc/CC/ftn (nvc/nvc++/nvfortran)` as the compiler.
2. It also specifies that we need to add the flags `-mp=gpu -gpu=cc80` to compile our code.

Therefore, to answer the question, I would recommend using the following command:

```
CC -mp=gpu -gpu=cc80 hello.cpp
ftn -mp=gpu -gpu=cc80 hello.F90
```

This is because `CC` is the compiler for C/C++/Fortran code and we need to add the flags `-mp=gpu -gpu=cc80` to compile our code using PrgEnv-nvhpc.

<DOCUMENT>Building on Polaris

The following table shows what compiler and flags to use with which PrgEnv:

module compiler flags PrgEnv-nvhpc cc/CC/ftn (nvc/nvc++/nvfortran) -mp=gpu -gpu=cc80 llvm mpicc/mpicxx (clang/clang++) -fopenmp -fopenmp-targets=nvptx64-nvidia-cuda PrgEnv-gnu cc/CC/ftn (gcc/g++/gfortran) -fopenmp PrgEnv-cray cc/CC/ftn -fopenmp

For example to compile a simple code hello.cpp:

For PrgEnv-nvhpc, after loading the modules as discussed above we would use:

CC -mp=gpu -gpu=cc80 hello.cpp
ftn -mp=gpu -gpu=cc80 hello.F90

For LLVM, after loading the modules as discussed above:

mpicxx -fopenmp -fopenmp-targets=nvptx64-nvidia-cuda hello.cpp

For PrgEnv-gnu, after loading the modules as discussed above we would use:

CC -fopenmp hello.cpp
ftn -fopenmp hello.F90

For PrgEnv-cray, after loading the modules as discussed above we would use:

CC -fopenmp hello.cpp
ftn -fopenmp hello.F90

Running on Polaris

To run, you can run the produced executable or with mpiexec in a job script, and then submit the script to the Polaris queue, like:

```
$ cat submit.sh

!/bin/sh

PBS -l select=1:system=polaris

PBS -l walltime=0:30:00

PBS -q debug

PBS -A Catalyst

PBS -l filesystems=home:eagle

cd ${PBS_O_WORKDIR}
 mpiexec -n 1 ./executable
$ # submit to the queue:
$ qsub -l select=1:system=polaris -l walltime=0:30:00 -l filesystems=home:eagle -q debug -A Catalyst ./submit.sh
```

In the above, having the PBS options in the script and on the command line is redundant, but we put it there to show both ways of launching. This submits the script to one node in the debug queue on Polaris, requesting 30 min and the eagle and home filesystems. It will charge project Catalyst for the time.

More details for setting up the job script are in Job Scheduling and Execution section.

Example

```
$ cat hello.cpp

include

include

int main( int argv, char** argc ) {

printf( ""Number of devices: %d\n"", omp_get_num_devices() );</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>ParaView and Visit

ParaView module has been updated. For more information, see https://docs.alcf.anl.gov/polaris/visualization/paraview/ and https://docs.alcf.anl.gov/polaris/visualization/paraview-manual-launch/

Visit module is in the process of being updated.

Changes to Memory Limits on Login Nodes

Memory limits were lowered on the logins due to resource contention to 8GB of memory, and 8 cores per user. 
This might result in error messages indicating abnormal process termination for user processes run on logins.

Examples of the error messages people might see are:

nvcc error   : 'cudafe++' died due to signal 9 (Kill signal)

g++-12: fatal error: Killed signal terminated program cc1plus

These errors are likely due to exhausting the per-user resources on a login node as each user is allocated 8 cores and 8GB memory.
To avoid this you can either:

Reduce the parallelism of your compile, such as using -j or -j4 flags

Request a debug node and run your compile there where you will have the full resources of the node at your disposal</DOCUMENT>

GPU package

The module environments above can be used to build LAMMPS with the GPU package as well. Copies of Makefiles for building with the GPU package using CUDA for GPU support with the GNU and NVHPC compilers are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo here.

Performance Notes

Some useful information on accelerator packages and expectations can be found on the LAMMPS website here.</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Currently, MIG configuration is only available in the debug, debug-scaling, and preemptable queues.  submissions to other queues will result in any MIG config files passed being silently ignored

Files which do not match the above syntax will be silently rejected, and any invalid configurations in properly formatted files will be silently ignored. Please test any changes to your configuration in an interactive job session before use

A basic validator script is available at /soft/pbs/mig_conf_validate.sh. It will check for simple errors in your config, and print the expected configuration. For example:

```shell
ascovel@polaris-login-02:~> /soft/pbs/mig_conf_validate.sh -h
usage: mig_conf_validate.sh -c CONFIG_FILE
ascovel@polaris-login-02:~> /soft/pbs/mig_conf_validate.sh -c ./polaris-mig/mig_config.json

Horovod works best when you limit the visible devices to only one GPU.  Note that if you import mpi4py or horovod, and then do something like os.environ[""CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES""] = hvd.local_rank(), it may not actually work!  You must set the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable prior to doing MPI.COMM_WORLD.init(), which is done in horovod.init() as well as implicitly in from mpi4py import MPI.   On Polaris specifically, you can use the environment variable PMI_LOCAL_RANK (as well as PMI_LOCAL_SIZE) to learn information about the node-local MPI ranks.

TensorFlow Dataloaders

Additional information to be provided.</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>Note: that the particles.000* is still visible.

Unhide the particles.000*data: click Eye icon

Select particles.000*data: click on name

Filters->Alphabetical->Glyph or click on the Glyph icon from the menu bar

Glyph Type: Sphere

Radius:. 0.15

Orient: Unchecked

Scale Mode: off

Set Scale Factor: 1 - Edit: Checked

Maximum Number of Points: 3000

Mask Points: Checked

Random Mode: Unchecked

Click the Apply button

Since our goal was to unclutter the display, let's hide the particles.000*by toggling them off, by clicking on the Eye icon next to it in the Pipeline Browser

Let's also switch to the Display tab in the Object Inspector, with Glyph1 selected, and change the Color by value to GlyphVector. Since the GlyphVector value is based on the velocity. We can Edit Color Map...and choose the same Blue to Red Rainbow preset that we previously chose for velocity

12. Enter: Red Blood Cells

Now let's add in both of the other data sets, which are polygonal meshes which make up Red Blood Cells (RBCs).

These two data sets are essentially the same kind of data, so we can apply the same filters and make the same types of representation changes to each of them. However, some of the RBCs are marked by the simulation that generated them as healthy (rbc.000) and some of them are marked as diseased (bad_rbc.000).

Unhide the rbc.000 and bad_rbc.000 data sets by clicking the Eye icon next to each of them to make them visible

13. Using Color to Differentiate Data

To enable us to distinguish these two types of data from one other, we can vary their representations.

One way to do this is by setting the color of the two data sets to different colors. Repeat this process for each of rbc.000 and bad_rbc.000, picking different colors.

Select one of the rbc data sets in the Pipeline Browser

Go to the Displaytab in the Object Inspector

In the Color by:dropdown select Solid Color

Click on the Set Solid Color... button

Select a color from the Select Colordialog that appears</DOCUMENT>

Special notes for Polaris

On Polaris, there is a known bug where python applications launched with mpi and that use fork to spawn processes can sometimes have unexplaned hangs.  For this reason, it is recommended to use start_method=""spawn"" on Polaris when using the MpiExecLauncher as is shown in the example config above.  Alternatively, another solution is to use the GNUParallelLauncher which uses GNU Parallel to spawn processes.  GNU Parallel can be loaded in your environment with the command module load gnu-parallel.  Both of these approaches will circumvent the hang issue from using fork.

Updates

For parsl versions after July 2023, the address passed in the HighThroughputExecutor needs to be set to address = address_by_interface(""bond0"").  With parsl versions prior to July 2023, it was recommended to use address = address_by_hostname() on Polaris, but with later versions this will not work on Polaris (or any other machine).</DOCUMENT>

User: Can you provide an example of how to use the `omp_get_num_devices()` function in Fortran?
Assistant: The final answer is that you can use the `omp_get_num_devices()` function in Fortran by including the `omp_lib` module and calling the function as shown above.

Cabana on Polaris

Following the Polaris upgrade to HPCM
1.10,
the module setup to use the prebuilt Kokkos changed.

Built against the prebuilt Kokkos on
polaris, the prebuilt Cabana
includes 3 backends: Serial and OpenMP for CPU execution and CUDA for GPU
execution. To use it, run

module load craype-x86-milan
module load craype-accel-nvidia80
module swap PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-gnu
module use /soft/modulefiles
module load cuda-PrgEnv-nvidia/12.2.91
module load kokkos cabana

Cabana is a headers-only package; there are no actual libraries installed.</DOCUMENT>
<DOCUMENT>```
module restore
module load craype-accel-nvidia80

module use /soft/modulefiles
module load spack-pe-base cmake
```

The top portion of Makefile.polaris_nvhpc_kokkos used to build LAMMPS with the KOKKOS package using the NVHPC compilers is shown as an example.

```

polaris_nvhpc_kokkos = Flags for NVIDIA A100, NVIDIA Compiler, MPICH, CUDA

make polaris_nvhpc_kokkos -j 16

```

With the appropriate LAMMPS Makefile in place an executable can be compiled as in the following example. Note, per-user limits on the login nodes will reduce the maximum parallelism for compilation. Users are encouraged to compile on a compute node in an interactive session if necessary.

cd lammps-<version>/src
make yes-KOKKOS
make polaris_nvhpc_kokkos -j 32
