{"text": "### Human: What compiler flags do I use with PrgEnv-nvhpc?### Assistant: To use compiler flags with PrgEnv-nvhpc, you would use `cc/CC/ftn (nvc/nvc++/nvfortran) -mp=gpu -gpu=cc80`.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The context states that for PrgEnv-nvhpc, we need to use `cc/CC/ftn (nvc/nvc++/nvfortran)` as the compiler.\n2. It also specifies that we need to add the flags `-mp=gpu -gpu=cc80` to compile our code.\n\nTherefore, to answer the question, I would recommend using the following command:\n\n```\nCC -mp=gpu -gpu=cc80 hello.cpp\nftn -mp=gpu -gpu=cc80 hello.F90\n```\n\nThis is because `CC` is the compiler for C/C++/Fortran code and we need to add the flags `-mp=gpu -gpu=cc80` to compile our code using PrgEnv-nvhpc."}
