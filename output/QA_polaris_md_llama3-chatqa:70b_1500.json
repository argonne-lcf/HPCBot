Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with PyTorch operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the PyTorch Automatic Mixed Precision package (AMP), as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  In PyTorch, users generally need to manage casting and loss scaling manually,  though context managers and function decorators can provide easy tools to do this.\n\nPyTorch has a JIT module as well as backends to support op fusion, similar to TensorFlow's tf.function tools.  However, PyTorch JIT capabilities are newer and may not yield performance improvements.  Please see TorchScript for more information.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nPyTorch is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with PyTorch has been seen with both DDP and Horovod.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation or the Distributed Data Parallel documentation.  Some Polaris-specific details that may be helpful to you:",

If you don't rebuild your binaries, they will not run successfully, which may lead to job failures or unexpected behavior.\n\nFinal Answer:\n<ANSWER>: You need to rebuild your application binaries after the Polaris system upgrade because existing binaries are unlikely to run successfully due to changes in the programming environment, OS, and other software environments."

For this reason, it is recommended to use start_method=\"spawn\" on Polaris when using the MpiExecLauncher as is shown in the example config above.

GNU Parallel can be loaded in your environment with the command module load gnu-parallel.

A Balsam Site runs on a node with access to the job scheduler, where it can submit and monitor jobs. Overall job state is aggregated on the Balsam Server, making job data from all Sites accessible from any individual site (or the user's laptop), via the command-line interface or the Python API. To get information on how to use the command line tool, you can type balsam --help in your shell.\n\nFull documentation for Balsam is available online.\n\nBalsam requires Python 3.7+. To install Balsam on Polaris, first set up a virtual Python environment:\n\nshell\nmodule load conda\nconda activate base\npython -m venv env\nsource env/bin/activate\npip install --upgrade pip\npip install --pre balsam\n\nTo use Balsam, users need an account on the Balsam server.  Users can get an account by contacting the ALCF Help Desk.  Once a user has an account, they can login and make a new site.  A Balsam site is a project space for your workflow. You will be prompted to select what machine (Polaris) you are working on when creating a new site:\n\nshell\nbalsam login\nbalsam site init -n new-site new-site\ncd new-site\nbalsam site start\n\nSee the Balsam documentation for full details.",

To use it from a compute node, please do:\n\nbash\nmodule load conda\nconda activate\n\nThen, you can load PyTorch in python as usual (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):\n\n```python\n\nimport torch\ntorch.version\n'1.12.0a0+git67ece03'\n\n```\n\nThis installation of PyTorch was built from source and the cuda libraries it uses are found via the CUDA_HOME environment variable (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):\n\nbash\n$ echo $CUDA_HOME\n/soft/datascience/cuda/cuda_11.5.2_495.29.05_linux\n\nIf you need to build applications that use this version of PyTorch and CUDA, we recommend using these cuda libraries to ensure compatibility.  We periodically update the PyTorch release, though updates will come in the form of new versions of the conda module.\n\nPyTorch is also available through nvidia containers that have been translated to Singularity containers.

GNU-parallel seems to be a parallel processing tool, while XALT appears to be some kind of statistical analysis library (based on the presence of GSL, which stands for GNU Scientific Library). Given these different domains, it's unlikely that there would be direct compatibility issues between the two packages.\n\n##begin_quote##\n(D)\n##end_quote##\n\nBased on this reasoning, I conclude that XALT is likely compatible with GNU-parallel.

This suggests that these dates might be related to the creation or modification time of these files rather than the actual release date of XALT version 3.0.1.\n\nHowever, since there is no other information provided about the release date, I will assume that one of these dates corresponds to the actual release of XALT version 3.0.1.\n\n3.

JAX is built on XLA (the same XLA TensorFlow uses) as well as AutoGrad, and additionally has acceleration tools that operate on functions such as vmap, jit, etc.  JAX is not as widespread in machine learning as TensorFlow and PyTorch for traditional models (Computer Vision, Language Models) though it is quickly gaining promienence.  JAX is very powerful when a program needs non-traditional autodifferentiation or vectorizatoin, such as: forward-mode AD, higher order derivatives, Jacobians, Hessians, or any combination of the above.  Users of JAX on Polaris are encouraged to read the user documentation in detail, particularly the details about pure-functional programming, no in-place operations, and the common mistakes in writing functions for the @jit decorator.\n\nJAX on Polaris\n\nJAX is installed on Polaris via the conda module, available with:\nbash\nmodule load conda; conda activate\n\nThen, you can load JAX in python as usual (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):\n\n```python\n\nimport jax\njax.version\n'0.3.15'\n\n```\n\nNotes on JAX 0.3.15\n\nOn Polaris, due to a bug, an environment variable must be set to use JAX on GPUs.  The following code will crash:\npython\nimport jax.numpy as numpy\na = numpy.zeros(1000)\noutputting an error that looks like:\npython\njaxlib.xla_extension.XlaRuntimeError: UNKNOWN: no kernel image is available for execution on the device",

In this case, it will be important to have the craype-accel-nvidia80 module loaded both when compiling your application and during runtime to correctly link against a GPU Transport Layer (GTL) MPI library. Otherwise, you'll likely see GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED is requested, but GTL library is not linked errors during runtime.\n- If running on a specific GPU or subset of GPUs is desired, then the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable can be used. For example, if one only wanted an application to access the first two GPUs on a node, then setting CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 could be used.\n\nBinding MPI ranks to GPUs\n\nThe Cray MPI on Polaris does not currently support binding MPI ranks to GPUs. For applications that need this support, this instead can be handled by use of a small helper script that will appropriately set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES for each MPI rank. One example is available here where each MPI rank is similarly bound to a single GPU with round-robin assignment.\n\nA example set_affinity_gpu_polaris.sh script follows where GPUs are assigned round-robin to MPI ranks.\n\n```bash\n\n!/bin/bash -l\n\nnum_gpus=4\n\nneed to assign GPUs in reverse order due to topology",

The key phrase that stands out is \"Changes to Memory Limits on Login Nodes\". This suggests that there have been changes to the memory limits on login nodes.\n\n##begin_quote##\nMemory limits were lowered on the logins due to resource contention to 8GB of memory, and 8 cores per user.\n##end_quote##\n\nThis quote indicates that each user is now allocated only 8 cores and 8GB of memory. This could potentially cause issues with processes that require more resources than this.\n\nThe error messages provided, such as \"nvcc error: 'cudafe++' died due to signal 9 (Kill signal)\" and \"g++-12: fatal error: Killed signal terminated program cc1plus\", suggest that the processes are being terminated due to exceeding these memory limits.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the cause of the error messages is the exhaustion of per-user resources on login nodes, specifically the memory limit of 8GB and core allocation of 8 cores per user.\n\n<ANSWER>: The cause of error messages indicating abnormal process termination for user processes run on logins is the exhaustion of per-user resources on login nodes due to the lowered memory limits."

For this reason, it is recommended to use start_method=\"spawn\" on Polaris when using the MpiExecLauncher as is shown in the example config above.  Alternatively, another solution is to use the GNUParallelLauncher which uses GNU Parallel to spawn processes.  GNU Parallel can be loaded in your environment with the command module load gnu-parallel.  Both of these approaches will circumvent the hang issue from using fork.\n\nUpdates\n\nFor parsl versions after July 2023, the address passed in the HighThroughputExecutor needs to be set to address = address_by_interface(\"bond0\").  With parsl versions prior to July 2023, it was recommended to use address = address_by_hostname() on Polaris, but with later versions this will not work on Polaris (or any other machine).",

XLA will compile a tf.Graph object, generated with tf.function or similar, and perform optimizations like operation-fusion.  XLA can give impressive performance boosts with almost no user changes except to set an environment variable TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2.  If your code is complex, or has dynamically sized tensors (tensors where the shape changes every iteration), XLA can be detrimental: the overhead for compiling functions can be large enough to mitigate performance improvements.  XLA is particularly powerful when combined with reduced precision, yielding speedups > 100% in some models.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nTensorFlow is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.

Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with TensorFlow operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the tf.keras.mixed_precision Policy, as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  If you use a custom training loop (and not keras.Model.fit), you will also need to apply loss scaling.\n\nUse TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.  Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.  When possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention.",

This suggests that the purpose of the `--cpu-bind` directive is related to assigning or binding CPUs to specific applications or processes. In this case, it appears to be used in conjunction with the `depth` option to specify the number of CPUs per rank.\n\nThe context also mentions that `--depth number of cpus per rank (useful with --cpu-bind)`. This implies that the `--cpu-bind` directive is used to bind processes or applications to specific CPUs, and the `--depth` option specifies how many CPUs each process should be bound to.\n\nTherefore, the purpose of the `--cpu-bind` directive in this submission script is to specify CPU binding for the application, allowing it to take advantage of multiple CPUs per rank.\n\n<ANSWER>: The purpose of the `--cpu-bind` directive is to specify CPU binding for the application."

This suggests that we have a multi-core processor with multiple hardware threads available. We are also given the directive `-env set environment variables (--env OMP_NUM_THREADS=2)` which sets the number of OpenMP threads to 2.\n\nNext, we see that `NDEPTH=8` is set, which means that there will be 8 hardware threads per rank (i.e., spacing between MPI ranks). Additionally, `NTHREADS=8` is set, which means that there will be 8 software threads per rank to launch (i.e., OMP_NUM_THREADS).\n\nNow, let's analyze the job submission script. We see that `mpiexec --np ${NTOTRANKS} -ppn ${NRANKS} -d ${NDEPTH} --cpu-bind depth -env OMP_NUM_THREADS=${NTHREADS} ./hello_affinity`. The `-d ${NDEPTH}` directive sets the number of hardware threads per rank to 8, which matches our previous analysis.\n\nFinally, we can conclude that each rank will have 8 OpenMP threads running simultaneously.

Designed at MIT to tackle large-scale\npartial-differential equation simulation and distributed linear algebra, Julia\nfeatures a robust ecosystem of tools for\noptimization,\nstatistics, parallel programming, and data\nvisualization. Julia is actively developed by the Julia\nLabs team at MIT and in\nindustry, along with hundreds of domain-expert\nscientists and programmers worldwide.\n\nContributing\n\nThis guide is a first draft of the Julia documentation for Polaris. If you have any\nsuggestions or contributions, please open a pull request or contact us by\nopening a ticket at the ALCF Helpdesk.\n\nJulia Installation\n\nWe encourage users interested in using Julia on Polaris to install in their home or project directories at this time. Using the official Julia 1.9 binaries from the Julia\nwebpage is recommended.\nJuliaup provides a convenient way to\ninstall Julia and manage the various Julia versions. The default installation will install julia, juliaup, and other commands in a ${HOME}/.julia directory and update profile files like .bashrc to update PATH to include that directory. One can customize the installation to change these defaults.\n\nbash\nmodule load craype-accel-nvidia80\ncurl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh",

In this case, it will be important to have the craype-accel-nvidia80 module loaded both when compiling your application and during runtime to correctly link against a GPU Transport Layer (GTL) MPI library.

For example, if one only wanted an application to access the first two GPUs on a node, then setting CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 could be used.\n\nBinding MPI ranks to GPUs\n\nThe Cray MPI on Polaris does not currently support binding MPI ranks to GPUs.

For this reason, it is recommended to use start_method=\"spawn\" on Polaris when using the MpiExecLauncher as is shown in the example config above.  Alternatively, another solution is to use the GNUParallelLauncher which uses GNU Parallel to spawn processes.  GNU Parallel can be loaded in your environment with the command module load gnu-parallel.  Both of these approaches will circumvent the hang issue from using fork.\n\nUpdates\n\nFor parsl versions after July 2023, the address passed in the HighThroughputExecutor needs to be set to address = address_by_interface(\"bond0\").  With parsl versions prior to July 2023, it was recommended to use address = address_by_hostname() on Polaris, but with later versions this will not work on Polaris (or any other machine).",

        "cot_answer": "To submit an interactive job on a Compute Node in Polaris, you can use the `qsub` command. Here's how:\n\n1. First, specify the resources required for your job using the `-l` option. For example, to request 1 node for a period of 1 hour, you would use the following command:\n```bash\nqsub -I -l select=1 -l walltime=1:00:00 ...\n```\n2. Next, specify the queue where your job should be executed using the `-q` option. For example, to execute your job in the `debug` queue, you would use the following command:\n```bash\nqsub -I -l select=1 -l walltime=1:00:00 -q debug ...\n```\n3. Finally, specify the project name that has access to the resources required for your job using the `-A` option.\n\nHere's an example of how you could submit an interactive job:\n```bash\nqsub -I -l select=1 -l walltime=1:00:00 -q debug -A <project_name>\n```\n##begin_quote##\nUsers with different needs, such as assigning multiple GPUs per MPI rank, can modify the above script to suit their needs.\n##end_quote##\n\nBy submitting an interactive job using `qsub`, you will be able to access a Compute Node and perform tasks such as editing, building, or testing applications.\n\n<ANSWER>: You can submit an interactive job on a Compute Node in Polaris by running the command `qsub -I -l select=1 -l walltime=1:00:00 -q debug -A <project_name>`."

For performance, it will likely be necessary to ensure that each application runs on a distinct set of CPU resources and/or targets specific GPUs.

CUDA-GDB is an extension to GDB, the GNU Project debugger. The tool provides developers with a mechanism for debugging CUDA applications running on actual hardware. This enables developers to debug applications without the potential variations introduced by simulation and emulation environments.\n\nStep-by-step guide\n\nDebug Compilation\n\nNVCC, the NVIDIA CUDA compiler driver, provides a mechanism for generating the debugging information necessary for CUDA-GDB to work properly. The -g -G option pair must be passed to NVCC when an application is compiled for ease of debugging with CUDA-GDB; for example,\nnvcc -g -G foo.cu -o foo\nUsing this line to compile the CUDA application foo.cu\n* forces -O0 compilation, with the exception of very limited dead-code eliminations and register-spilling optimizations.\n* makes the compiler include debug information in the executable\n\nRunning CUDA-gdb on Polaris compute nodes\n\nStart an interactive job mode on Polaris as follows:\n\n```\n$ qsub -I -l select=1 -l walltime=1:00:00",

        "question": "How can you run multiple MPI applications simultaneously on a node?",
        "cot_answer": "<ANSWER>: To run multiple MPI applications simultaneously on a node, you can launch several `mpiexec` commands and background them. This is achieved by providing a list of CPUs using the `--cpu-bind` option, which when combined with `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`, allows you to specify exactly which CPU and GPU resources to run each application on.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, you need to export the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable to specify which GPU resource to use for each application.\n2. Then, you can launch multiple instances of `mpiexec` in the background using the `&` symbol at the end of each command.\n3. For each instance, you need to specify the number of MPI ranks (`-n`) and the number of processes per node (`--ppn`).\n4. You also need to provide a list of CPUs to bind each application to using the `--cpu-bind` option.\n\nFor example, in the context provided, four instances of the application are running simultaneously on a single node:\n\n```\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:24:25:26:27:28:29:30:31 ./hello_affinity &\n...\n```\n\nBy following these steps, you can run multiple MPI applications simultaneously on a single node.\n\nFinal answer:\n<ANSWER>: Run multiple `mpiexec` commands in the background and specify CPU resources using the `--cpu-bind` option."

If build your application is problematic for some reason (e.g. absence of a GPU), then users are encouraged to build and test applications directly on one of the Polaris compute nodes via an interactive job. The discussion below makes use of the NVHPC compilers in the default environment as illustrative examples. Similar examples for other compilers on Polaris are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo.\n\nCPU MPI+OpenMP Example\n\nOne of the first useful tasks with any new machine, scheduler, and job launcher is to ensure one is binding MPI ranks and OpenMP threads to the host cpu as intended. A simple HelloWorld MPI+OpenMP example is available here to get started with.\n\nThe application can be straightforwardly compiled using the Cray compiler wrappers.\nCC -fopenmp main.cpp -o hello_affinity\n\nThe executable hello_affinity can then be launched in a job script (or directly in shell of interactive job) using mpiexec as discussed here.\n\n```\n\n!/bin/sh\n\nPBS -l select=1:system=polaris\n\nPBS -l place=scatter\n\nPBS -l walltime=0:30:00\n\nPBS -l filesystems=home\n\nMPI example w/ 16 MPI ranks per node spread evenly across cores\n\nNNODES=wc -l < $PBS_NODEFILE\nNRANKS_PER_NODE=16\nNDEPTH=4\nNTHREADS=1",

                "TensorFlow Best Practices on Polaris\n\nSingle Node Performance\n\nWhen running TensorFlow applications, we have found the following practices to be generally, if not universally, useful and encourage you to try some of these techniques to boost performance of your own applications.\n\nUse Reduced Precision. Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with TensorFlow operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the tf.keras.mixed_precision Policy, as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  If you use a custom training loop (and not keras.Model.fit), you will also need to apply loss scaling.\n\nUse TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.  Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.  When possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention.",

        "cot_answer": "To control the location of a few specific nodes when running jobs on a large cluster, you can use the PBS select option. Here's a step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. If you want to run your job on specific nodes, you can specify them individually using the `-l select` option followed by the node names. For example: `--l select=1:vnode=<node name1>+1:vnode=<node name2>...`. However, this approach becomes tedious for large jobs.\n2. If you want to control the location of a few nodes out of many, you can specify them along with a system or group specifier. For example: `--l select=1:vnode=<node name1>+1:vnode=<node name2>+62:system=foo`. This will run your job on the specified nodes and the rest will be ignored.\n3. To group all your nodes in a rack, you can use the `place` specifier with the `group` option. For example: `--l select=8:system=foo,place=scatter:group=tier0`. This will run your job on nodes from the specified rack and tier0 group.\n4. To specify a specific rack or dragonfly group instead of any of them, you can use the `select` option with the rack or group identifier. For example: `--l select 10:tier0=x3001-g0`.\n\nFinal Answer:\n<ANSWER>: Use the PBS select option to control the location of specific nodes, such as `-l select=1:vnode=<node name1>+1:vnode=<node name2>+62:system=foo` or `-l select=8:system=foo,place=scatter:group=tier0`."

If build your application is problematic for some reason (e.g. absence of a GPU), then users are encouraged to build and test applications directly on one of the Polaris compute nodes via an interactive job. The discussion below makes use of the NVHPC compilers in the default environment as illustrative examples. Similar examples for other compilers on Polaris are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo.\n\nCPU MPI+OpenMP Example\n\nOne of the first useful tasks with any new machine, scheduler, and job launcher is to ensure one is binding MPI ranks and OpenMP threads to the host cpu as intended. A simple HelloWorld MPI+OpenMP example is available here to get started with.\n\nThe application can be straightforwardly compiled using the Cray compiler wrappers.\nCC -fopenmp main.cpp -o hello_affinity\n\nThe executable hello_affinity can then be launched in a job script (or directly in shell of interactive job) using mpiexec as discussed here.\n\n```\n\n!/bin/sh\n\nPBS -l select=1:system=polaris\n\nPBS -l place=scatter\n\nPBS -l walltime=0:30:00\n\nPBS -l filesystems=home\n\nMPI example w/ 16 MPI ranks per node spread evenly across cores\n\nNNODES=wc -l < $PBS_NODEFILE\nNRANKS_PER_NODE=16\nNDEPTH=4\nNTHREADS=1",

CUDA-GDB is an extension to GDB, the GNU Project debugger. The tool provides developers with a mechanism for debugging CUDA applications running on actual hardware. This enables developers to debug applications without the potential variations introduced by simulation and emulation environments.\n\nStep-by-step guide\n\nDebug Compilation\n\nNVCC, the NVIDIA CUDA compiler driver, provides a mechanism for generating the debugging information necessary for CUDA-GDB to work properly. The -g -G option pair must be passed to NVCC when an application is compiled for ease of debugging with CUDA-GDB; for example,\nnvcc -g -G foo.cu -o foo\nUsing this line to compile the CUDA application foo.cu\n* forces -O0 compilation, with the exception of very limited dead-code eliminations and register-spilling optimizations.\n* makes the compiler include debug information in the executable\n\nRunning CUDA-gdb on Polaris compute nodes\n\nStart an interactive job mode on Polaris as follows:\n\n```\n$ qsub -I -l select=1 -l walltime=1:00:00",

If you wanted everything in the same dragonfly group, replace tier0 with tier1.  Note that you have to also explicitly specify the place when you use group.

This guide details the use of containers on Polaris, including custom container creation, large-scale execution, and common pitfalls.\n\nApptainer Setup\n\nPolaris employs Apptainer (formerly known as Singularity) for container management. To set up Apptainer, run:\n\nbash\nmodule use /soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/install/modulefiles/Core\nmodule load apptainer\napptainer version #1.2.2\n\nThe Apptainer version on Polaris is 1.2.2. Detailed user documentation is available here\n\nBuilding from Docker or Argonne GitHub Container Registry\n\nContainers on Polaris can be built by writing Dockerfiles on a local machine and then publish the container to DockerHub, or by directly building them on ALCF compute node by writing an Apptainer recipe file. If you prefer to use existing containers, you can pull them from various registries like DockerHub and run them on Polaris.\n\nSince Docker requires root privileges, which users do not have on Polaris, existing Docker containers must be converted to Apptainer. To build a Docker-based container on Polaris, use the following as an example:",

It provides detailed performance metrics and API debugging via a user interface and command line tool.\n\nIn addition, the baseline feature of this tool allows users to compare results within the tool. NVIDIA Nsight Compute provides a customizable and data-driven user interface,  metric collection, and can be extended with analysis scripts for post-processing results.\n\nStep-by-step guide\n\nCommon part on Polaris\n\nBuild your application for Polaris, and then submit your job script to Polaris or start an interactive job mode on Polaris as follows:\n\n```\n$ qsub -I -l select=1 -l walltime=1:00:00 -l filesystems=home:eagle -q debug -A\n\n$ module li\n\nCurrently Loaded Modules:\n  1) nvhpc/23.9          5) cray-pmi/6.1.13      9) PrgEnv-nvhpc/8.5.0      13) darshan/3.4.4\n  2) craype/2.7.30       6) cray-pals/1.3.4     10) libfabric/1.15.2.0\n  3) cray-dsmml/0.2.2    7) cray-libpals/1.3.4  11) craype-network-ofi\n  4) cray-mpich/8.1.28   8) craype-x86-milan    12) perftools-base/23.12.0",

                "Use XLA compilation on your code.  XLA is the Accelerated Linear Algebra library that is available in tensorFlow and critical in software like JAX.  XLA will compile a tf.Graph object, generated with tf.function or similar, and perform optimizations like operation-fusion.  XLA can give impressive performance boosts with almost no user changes except to set an environment variable TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2.  If your code is complex, or has dynamically sized tensors (tensors where the shape changes every iteration), XLA can be detrimental: the overhead for compiling functions can be large enough to mitigate performance improvements.  XLA is particularly powerful when combined with reduced precision, yielding speedups > 100% in some models.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nTensorFlow is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with tensorFlow has been seen with horovod in particular.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation.  Some polaris specific details that may be helpful to you:\n\nCPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.

Similar examples for other compilers on Polaris are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo.\n\nCPU MPI+OpenMP Example\n\nOne of the first useful tasks with any new machine, scheduler, and job launcher is to ensure one is binding MPI ranks and OpenMP threads to the host cpu as intended. A simple HelloWorld MPI+OpenMP example is available here to get started with.\n\nThe application can be straightforwardly compiled using the Cray compiler wrappers.\nCC -fopenmp main.cpp -o hello_affinity\n\nThe executable hello_affinity can then be launched in a job script (or directly in shell of interactive job) using mpiexec as discussed here.\n\n```\n\n!/bin/sh\n\nPBS -l select=1:system=polaris\n\nPBS -l place=scatter\n\nPBS -l walltime=0:30:00\n\nPBS -l filesystems=home\n\nMPI example w/ 16 MPI ranks per node spread evenly across cores\n\nNNODES=wc -l < $PBS_NODEFILE\nNRANKS_PER_NODE=16\nNDEPTH=4\nNTHREADS=1",
        "question": "What is the purpose of setting variables like NNODES, NRANKS_PER_NODE, NDEPTH, and NTHREADS in a job script for Polaris?",
        "cot_answer": "To answer this question, I will follow these steps:\n\n1. Read the context and identify the relevant information related to setting variables like NNODES, NRANKS_PER_NODE, NDEPTH, and NTHREADS in a job script for Polaris.\n2. Analyze the provided example job script and understand how these variables are used.\n\nReasoning:\nThe context mentions that users are encouraged to build and test applications directly on one of the Polaris compute nodes via an interactive job. The discussion also provides examples of building CPU and GPU-enabled codes on Polaris for several programming models. One such example is a simple HelloWorld MPI+OpenMP application, which can be compiled using the Cray compiler wrappers.\n\nThe provided job script is used to launch the executable hello_affinity in a job script (or directly in shell of interactive job) using mpiexec. The script sets various variables, including NNODES, NRANKS_PER_NODE, NDEPTH, and NTHREADS.\n\n##begin_quote##\nMPI example w/ 16 MPI ranks per node spread evenly across cores\nNNODES=wc -l < $PBS_NODEFILE\nNRANKS_PER_NODE=16\nNDEPTH=4\nNTHREADS=1\n##end_quote##\n\nFrom this information, it can be inferred that these variables are used to specify the number of nodes (NNODES), the number of MPI ranks per node (NRANKS_PER_NODE), the depth of the tree (NDEPTH), and the number of threads (NTHREADS) for the job script.\n\nFinal Answer:\n<ANSWER>: These variables are used to specify the number of nodes, MPI ranks per node, depth of the tree, and number of threads for the job script on Polaris."

Many tools exist to address this, of which parsl is just one.  On this page, we'll highlight some of the key pieces of information about parsl that are relevant to Polaris.  Parsl is also extensively documented, has a dedicated Slack Channel, and a large community of users and developers beyond ALCF.  We encourage you to engage with the parsl community for support with parsl specific questions, and for Polaris-specific questions or problems, please contact support@alcf.anl.gov.\n\nGetting Parsl on Polaris\n\nYou can install parsl building off of the conda modules.  You have some flexibility in how you want to extend the conda module to include parsl, but here is an example way to do it:\n\n```python\n\nLoad the Conda Module (needed everytime you use parsl)\n\nmodule load conda\nconda activate\n\nCreate a virtual env that uses the conda env as the system packages.\n\nOnly do the next line on initial set up:\n\npython -m venv --system-site-packages /path/to/your/virtualenv\n\nLoad the virtual env (every time):\n\nsource /path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/activate\n\nInstall parsl (only once)\n\npip install parsl\n\n```\n\nUsing Parsl on Polaris",

In this case, it will be important to have the craype-accel-nvidia80 module loaded both when compiling your application and during runtime to correctly link against a GPU Transport Layer (GTL) MPI library. Otherwise, you'll likely see GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED is requested, but GTL library is not linked errors during runtime.\n- If running on a specific GPU or subset of GPUs is desired, then the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable can be used. For example, if one only wanted an application to access the first two GPUs on a node, then setting CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 could be used.\n\nBinding MPI ranks to GPUs\n\nThe Cray MPI on Polaris does not currently support binding MPI ranks to GPUs. For applications that need this support, this instead can be handled by use of a small helper script that will appropriately set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES for each MPI rank. One example is available here where each MPI rank is similarly bound to a single GPU with round-robin assignment.\n\nA example set_affinity_gpu_polaris.sh script follows where GPUs are assigned round-robin to MPI ranks.\n\n```bash\n\n!/bin/bash -l\n\nnum_gpus=4\n\nneed to assign GPUs in reverse order due to topology",

Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with TensorFlow operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the tf.keras.mixed_precision Policy, as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  If you use a custom training loop (and not keras.Model.fit), you will also need to apply loss scaling.\n\nUse TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.  Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.  When possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention.",

This mapping is based on output from the nvidia-smi topo -m command and pairs CPUs with the closest GPU.\n\n```bash\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:24:25:26:27:28:29:30:31 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:16:17:18:19:20:21:22:23 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:8:9:10:11:12:13:14:15 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=3\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:0:1:2:3:4:5:6:7 ./hello_affinity &\n\nwait\n```\n\nCompute Node Access to the Internet\n\nCurrently, the only access the internet is via a proxy.

The Cray MPI wrappers will handle this automatically.\n\nNotes on Default Modules\n\ncraype-x86-rome: While the Polaris compute nodes currently have Milan CPUs, this module is loaded by default to avoid the craype-x86-milan module from adding a zen3 target not supported in the default nvhpc/21.9 compilers. The craype-x86-milan module is expected to be made default once a newer nvhpc version (e.g. 22.5) is made the default.\n\ncraype-accel-nvidia80: This module adds compiler flags to enable GPU acceleration for NVHPC compilers along with gpu-enabled MPI libraries as it is assumed that the majority of applications to be compiled on Polaris will target the GPUs for acceleration. Users building cpu-only applications may find it useful to unload this module to silence \"gpu code generation\" warnings.\n\nMixed C/C++ & Fortran Applications\n\nFor applications consisting of a mix of C/C++ and Fortran that also uses MPI, it is suggested that the programming environment chosen for Fortran be used to build the full application because of mpi.mod (and similar) incompatibilities.\n\nCompiling for GPUs",

For instance, if only your head node needed public access your select statement might looks something like: -l select=1:pubnet=True+63.\n\nControlling Where Your Job Runs\n\nIf you wish to have your job run on specific nodes form your select like this: -l select=1:vnode=<node name1>+1:vnode=<node name2>... . Obviously, that gets tedious for large jobs.\n\nIf you want to control the location of a few nodes, for example 2 out of 64, but the rest don't matter, you can do something like this: -l select=1:vnode=<node name1>+1:vnode=<node name2>+62:system=foo\n\nEvery node has a PBS resource called tier0 with a rack identifier and tier1 with a dragonfly group identifieer.  If you want all your nodes grouped in a rack, you can add the group specifier -l select=8:system=foo,place=scatter:group=tier0.  If you wanted everything in the same dragonfly group, replace tier0 with tier1.  Note that you have to also explicitly specify the place when you use group.  If you wanted a specific rack or dragonfly group instead of any of them, you are back to the select: -l select 10:tier0=x3001-g0.\n\nNetwork: Rack and Dragonfly Group Mappings",

One of these differences is that the -cuda flag instructs nvcc to compile .cu input files to .cu.cpp.ii output files, whereas it enables CUDA C/C++ or CUDA Fortran code generation for nvc, nvc++, and nvfortran. This suggests that nvcc is not intended to support standard C++ features like C++17.\n\nAdditionally, the context mentions that if you are using nvcc to invoke nvc++ and compiling C++17 code, you may see a warning and be unable to compile C++17 constructs. The warning message specifically states that the -std=c++17 flag is not supported with the configured host compiler, implying that nvcc is not designed to support this feature.\n\nTherefore, it is not possible to use the -std=c++17 flag when compiling with nvcc and nvc++. If you need to compile C++17 code, you should use a standard C++ compiler like nvc or nvc++."

A Balsam Site runs on a node with access to the job scheduler, where it can submit and monitor jobs. Overall job state is aggregated on the Balsam Server, making job data from all Sites accessible from any individual site (or the user's laptop), via the command-line interface or the Python API. To get information on how to use the command line tool, you can type balsam --help in your shell.\n\nFull documentation for Balsam is available online.\n\nBalsam requires Python 3.7+. To install Balsam on Polaris, first set up a virtual Python environment:\n\nshell\nmodule load conda\nconda activate base\npython -m venv env\nsource env/bin/activate\npip install --upgrade pip\npip install --pre balsam\n\nTo use Balsam, users need an account on the Balsam server.  Users can get an account by contacting the ALCF Help Desk.  Once a user has an account, they can login and make a new site.  A Balsam site is a project space for your workflow. You will be prompted to select what machine (Polaris) you are working on when creating a new site:\n\nshell\nbalsam login\nbalsam site init -n new-site new-site\ncd new-site\nbalsam site start\n\nSee the Balsam documentation for full details.",

This suggests that the compiler is expecting a declaration of a new type, but it's not finding one.\n\nLooking at the code snippet provided in the context, I see that the issue is with the line `std::bool_constant<(UnaryPred::value || ...)> {};`. The error message points to the `{}` part of this line, which suggests that the compiler is expecting a definition for `std::bool_constant`.\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to provide a definition for `std::bool_constant`. However, without more context about what `UnaryPred` and `...` are, it's difficult to give a specific solution.\n\nAssuming that `UnaryPred` is some kind of predicate or function object, and `...` represents some condition or expression, we can try to provide a simple definition for `std::bool_constant`.\n\nHere's one possible way to fix the issue:\n\n```cpp\n#include <type_traits>\n\ntemplate<bool B>\nstruct std::bool_constant : public std::integral_constant<bool, B> {};\n\n// ... rest of your code ...\n```\n\nIn this solution, we're defining a template struct `std::bool_constant` that takes a boolean value `B`. This struct inherits from `std::integral_constant`, which is a standard library type that represents a constant value. The `bool_constant` struct simply wraps the given boolean value and provides it as an integral constant.\n\nBy providing this definition, we should be able to fix the compilation issue.\n\n<ANSWER>: Provide a simple definition for `std::bool_constant`."

This enables developers to debug applications without the potential variations introduced by simulation and emulation environments.\n\nStep-by-step guide\n\nDebug Compilation\n\nNVCC, the NVIDIA CUDA compiler driver, provides a mechanism for generating the debugging information necessary for CUDA-GDB to work properly. The -g -G option pair must be passed to NVCC when an application is compiled for ease of debugging with CUDA-GDB; for example,\nnvcc -g -G foo.cu -o foo\nUsing this line to compile the CUDA application foo.cu\n* forces -O0 compilation, with the exception of very limited dead-code eliminations and register-spilling optimizations.\n* makes the compiler include debug information in the executable\n\nRunning CUDA-gdb on Polaris compute nodes\n\nStart an interactive job mode on Polaris as follows:\n\n```\n$ qsub -I -l select=1 -l walltime=1:00:00",

                "OpenMP\n\nOverview\n\nThe OpenMP API is an open standard for parallel programming. The specification document can be found here: https://www.openmp.org. The specification describes directives, runtime routines, and environment variables that allow an application developer to express parallelism (e.g. shared memory multiprocessing and device offloading). Many compiler vendors provide implementations of the OpenMP specification (https://www.openmp.org/specifications).\n\nSetting the environment to use OpenMP on Polaris\n\nMany of the programming environments available on Polaris have OpenMP support.\n\nmodule OpenMP CPU support? OpenMP GPU support? PrgEnv-nvhpc yes yes llvm yes yes PrgEnv-gnu yes no PrgEnv-cray yes yes*\n\nCurrently PrgEnv-cray is not recommended for OpenMP offload.\n\nBy default, the PrgEnv-nvhpc module is loaded. To switch to other modules, you can use module switch.\n\nUsing PrgEnv-nvhpc\n\nThis is loaded by default, so there's no need to load additional modules. You can confirm that it is loaded by running module list to check that PrgEnv-nvhpc is in the list.\n\nUsing LLVM\n\nTo use the LLVM module, load the following.\nmodule load mpiwrappers/cray-mpich-llvm\nmodule load cudatoolkit-standalone\n\nSee the the LLVM compiling page here for more information.\n\nUsing PrgEnv-gnu\n\nTo switch from PrgEnv-nvhpc to PrgEnv-gnu you can run:\n\nmodule switch PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-gnu",

For this reason, it is recommended to use start_method=\"spawn\" on Polaris when using the MpiExecLauncher as is shown in the example config above.  Alternatively, another solution is to use the GNUParallelLauncher which uses GNU Parallel to spawn processes.  GNU Parallel can be loaded in your environment with the command module load gnu-parallel.  Both of these approaches will circumvent the hang issue from using fork.\n\nUpdates\n\nFor parsl versions after July 2023, the address passed in the HighThroughputExecutor needs to be set to address = address_by_interface(\"bond0\").

XLA will compile a tf.Graph object, generated with tf.function or similar, and perform optimizations like operation-fusion.  XLA can give impressive performance boosts with almost no user changes except to set an environment variable TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2.  If your code is complex, or has dynamically sized tensors (tensors where the shape changes every iteration), XLA can be detrimental: the overhead for compiling functions can be large enough to mitigate performance improvements.  XLA is particularly powerful when combined with reduced precision, yielding speedups > 100% in some models.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nTensorFlow is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.

If your build system does require GPUs, you cannot yet compile on the Polaris login nodes, as they do not currently have GPUs installed. You may in this case compile your applications on the Polaris compute nodes. Do this by submitting an interactive single-node job, or running your build system in a batch job.\n\nHome File System\n\nIs it helpful to realize that there is a single HOME filesystem for users that can be accessed from the login and computes of each production resource at ALCF. Thus, users should be mindful of modifications to their environments (e.g. .bashrc) that may cause issues to arise due to differences between the systems.\n\nCray Programming Environment\n\nThe Cray Programming Environment (PE) uses three compiler wrappers for building software.

                "TensorFlow Best Practices on Polaris\n\nSingle Node Performance\n\nWhen running TensorFlow applications, we have found the following practices to be generally, if not universally, useful and encourage you to try some of these techniques to boost performance of your own applications.\n\nUse Reduced Precision. Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with TensorFlow operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the tf.keras.mixed_precision Policy, as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  If you use a custom training loop (and not keras.Model.fit), you will also need to apply loss scaling.\n\nUse TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.  Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.  When possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention.",

The craype-x86-milan module is expected to be made default once a newer nvhpc version (e.g. 22.5) is made the default.\n\ncraype-accel-nvidia80: This module adds compiler flags to enable GPU acceleration for NVHPC compilers along with gpu-enabled MPI libraries as it is assumed that the majority of applications to be compiled on Polaris will target the GPUs for acceleration.

All\nALCF-managed software is accessible to users via modules.\n\nThe base suite of software tools and libraries can be accessed by loading the\nspack-pe-base module. This adds a path to $MODULEPATH which contains\nnumerous modules.\n\nFor example, to load cmake starting from the default environment, a user\nshould run the following commands:\nmodule use /soft/modulefiles\nmodule load spack-pe-base\nmodule load cmake\nOther modules in spack-pe-base can be browsed by running module avail or\nmodule --show-hidden avail. The latter shows hidden modules which are\ninstalled as dependencies of the un-hidden modules.",

A Balsam Site runs on a node with access to the job scheduler, where it can submit and monitor jobs. Overall job state is aggregated on the Balsam Server, making job data from all Sites accessible from any individual site (or the user's laptop), via the command-line interface or the Python API. To get information on how to use the command line tool, you can type balsam --help in your shell.\n\nFull documentation for Balsam is available online.\n\nBalsam requires Python 3.7+. To install Balsam on Polaris, first set up a virtual Python environment:\n\nshell\nmodule load conda\nconda activate base\npython -m venv env\nsource env/bin/activate\npip install --upgrade pip\npip install --pre balsam\n\nTo use Balsam, users need an account on the Balsam server.  Users can get an account by contacting the ALCF Help Desk.  Once a user has an account, they can login and make a new site.  A Balsam site is a project space for your workflow. You will be prompted to select what machine (Polaris) you are working on when creating a new site:\n\nshell\nbalsam login\nbalsam site init -n new-site new-site\ncd new-site\nbalsam site start\n\nSee the Balsam documentation for full details.",

In this case, it will be important to have the craype-accel-nvidia80 module loaded both when compiling your application and during runtime to correctly link against a GPU Transport Layer (GTL) MPI library. Otherwise, you'll likely see GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED is requested, but GTL library is not linked errors during runtime.\n- If running on a specific GPU or subset of GPUs is desired, then the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable can be used. For example, if one only wanted an application to access the first two GPUs on a node, then setting CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 could be used.\n\nBinding MPI ranks to GPUs\n\nThe Cray MPI on Polaris does not currently support binding MPI ranks to GPUs. For applications that need this support, this instead can be handled by use of a small helper script that will appropriately set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES for each MPI rank. One example is available here where each MPI rank is similarly bound to a single GPU with round-robin assignment.\n\nA example set_affinity_gpu_polaris.sh script follows where GPUs are assigned round-robin to MPI ranks.\n\n```bash\n\n!/bin/bash -l\n\nnum_gpus=4\n\nneed to assign GPUs in reverse order due to topology",

The Cray MPI wrappers will handle this automatically.\n\nNotes on Default Modules\n\ncraype-x86-rome: While the Polaris compute nodes currently have Milan CPUs, this module is loaded by default to avoid the craype-x86-milan module from adding a zen3 target not supported in the default nvhpc/21.9 compilers. The craype-x86-milan module is expected to be made default once a newer nvhpc version (e.g. 22.5) is made the default.\n\ncraype-accel-nvidia80: This module adds compiler flags to enable GPU acceleration for NVHPC compilers along with gpu-enabled MPI libraries as it is assumed that the majority of applications to be compiled on Polaris will target the GPUs for acceleration. Users building cpu-only applications may find it useful to unload this module to silence \"gpu code generation\" warnings.\n\nMixed C/C++ & Fortran Applications\n\nFor applications consisting of a mix of C/C++ and Fortran that also uses MPI, it is suggested that the programming environment chosen for Fortran be used to build the full application because of mpi.mod (and similar) incompatibilities.\n\nCompiling for GPUs",

We can also refer to the Fall 20'23 ALCF User Hands-On Workshop repository for more information on using SmartSim and NekRS-ML on Polaris.\n\nFirst, let's start by building the examples. According to the context, we can find instructions on how to build and run the examples in the smartredis and onlineGNN branches. We'll need to follow these instructions to compile the code and prepare it for execution.\n\nOnce we've built the examples, we can launch them using the SmartSim API. As mentioned in the context, we'll need to export the MPICH_OFI_CXI_PID_BASE environment variable before launching the first MPI application, and then increment its value by 1 and re-export it before each successive call. This is done with the PalsMpiexecSettings() API.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide on how to do this:\n\n1. Export the MPICH_OFI_CXI_PID_BASE environment variable: `export MPICH_OFI_CXI_PID_BASE=0`\n2. Launch the first MPI application using the SmartSim API: `pals_mpiexec -n 4 --env_vars={'MPICH_OFI_CXI_PID_BASE':str(0)} my_mpi_app`\n3. Increment the value of MPICH_OFI_CXI_PID_BASE by 1 and re-export it: `export MPICH_OFI_CXI_PID_BASE=1`\n4. Launch subsequent MPI applications using the SmartSim API, incrementing the value of MPICH_OFI_CXI_PID_BASE each time: `pals_mpiexec -n 4 --env_vars={'MPICH_OFI_CXI_PID_BASE':str(1)} my_mpi_app`\n\nBy following these steps, we should be able to build and run examples with onlineGNN on Polaris.\n\nFinal Answer:\n<ANSWER>: To build and run examples with onlineGNN on Polaris, follow the instructions in the smartredis and onlineGNN branches, export MPICH_OFI_CXI_PID_BASE before launching the first MPI application, and increment its value by 1 and re-export it before each successive call using the PalsMpiexecSettings() API."

XLA can give impressive performance boosts with almost no user changes except to set an environment variable TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2.  If your code is complex, or has dynamically sized tensors (tensors where the shape changes every iteration), XLA can be detrimental: the overhead for compiling functions can be large enough to mitigate performance improvements.  XLA is particularly powerful when combined with reduced precision, yielding speedups > 100% in some models.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nTensorFlow is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.

The presence of `address_by_interface` and `get_all_checkpoints` functions implies that Parsl also provides features for addressing and checkpointing.\n\nBased on this analysis, I conclude that Parsl is a Python package that enables the execution of tasks on various providers and executors, with features such as address-by-interface and checkpointing.\n\n<ANSWER>: Parsl is a Python package that enables the execution of tasks on various providers and executors."

        "cot_answer": "To understand how Parsl's HighThroughputExecutor works, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to install Parsl using pip:\n##begin_quote##\npip install parsl\n##end_quote##\n\nNext, we import the necessary modules from Parsl. We'll use the `Config` module to configure our setup, the `PBSProProvider` module to connect to a PBS Pro cluster (in this case, Polaris), and the `HighThroughputExecutor` module to enable high-throughput execution:\n##begin_quote##\nfrom parsl.config import Config\nfrom parsl.providers import PBSProProvider\nfrom parsl.executors import HighThroughputExecutor\n##end_quote##\n\nWe'll also use the `MpiExecLauncher` or `GnuParallelLauncher` modules to launch our tasks. In this case, we're using the `GnuParallelLauncher`, which is suitable for high-throughput execution:\n##begin_quote##\nfrom parsl.launchers import GnuParallelLauncher\n##end_quote##\n\nTo enable checkpointing, we'll use the `get_all_checkpoints` function from Parsl's `utils` module:\n##begin_quote##\nfrom parsl.utils import get_all_checkpoints\n##end_quote##\n\nFinally, we set our user-specific options, such as the run directory:\n##begin_quote##\nrun_dir=\"/lus/grand/projects/yourproject/yourrundir/\"\n##end_quote##\n\nTo use the HighThroughputExecutor, we create an instance of it and pass in our configuration settings. This allows us to scale our tasks to a high-throughput computing system like Polaris.\n\n<ANSWER>: The Parsl's HighThroughputExecutor works by importing necessary modules, configuring the setup using the `Config` module, connecting to a PBS Pro cluster (in this case, Polaris) using the `PBSProProvider` module, and enabling high-throughput execution with the `HighThroughputExecutor` module."

Look at the context provided: `config = Config(executors=[...])`\n2. Identify the `HighThroughputExecutor` configuration: `HighThroughputExecutor(label=\"htex\", ...)`\n3.

The -g -G option pair must be passed to NVCC when an application is compiled for ease of debugging with CUDA-GDB; for example,\nnvcc -g -G foo.cu -o foo\nUsing this line to compile the CUDA application foo.cu\n* forces -O0 compilation, with the exception of very limited dead-code eliminations and register-spilling optimizations.\n* makes the compiler include debug information in the executable\n\nRunning CUDA-gdb on Polaris compute nodes\n\nStart an interactive job mode on Polaris as follows:\n\n```\n$ qsub -I -l select=1 -l walltime=1:00:00",

Many tools exist to address this, of which parsl is just one.  On this page, we'll highlight some of the key pieces of information about parsl that are relevant to Polaris.  Parsl is also extensively documented, has a dedicated Slack Channel, and a large community of users and developers beyond ALCF.  We encourage you to engage with the parsl community for support with parsl specific questions, and for Polaris-specific questions or problems, please contact support@alcf.anl.gov.\n\nGetting Parsl on Polaris\n\nYou can install parsl building off of the conda modules.  You have some flexibility in how you want to extend the conda module to include parsl, but here is an example way to do it:\n\n```python\n\nLoad the Conda Module (needed everytime you use parsl)\n\nmodule load conda\nconda activate\n\nCreate a virtual env that uses the conda env as the system packages.\n\nOnly do the next line on initial set up:\n\npython -m venv --system-site-packages /path/to/your/virtualenv\n\nLoad the virtual env (every time):\n\nsource /path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/activate\n\nInstall parsl (only once)\n\npip install parsl\n\n```\n\nUsing Parsl on Polaris",

Many tools exist to address this, of which parsl is just one.  On this page, we'll highlight some of the key pieces of information about parsl that are relevant to Polaris.  Parsl is also extensively documented, has a dedicated Slack Channel, and a large community of users and developers beyond ALCF.  We encourage you to engage with the parsl community for support with parsl specific questions, and for Polaris-specific questions or problems, please contact support@alcf.anl.gov.\n\nGetting Parsl on Polaris\n\nYou can install parsl building off of the conda modules.  You have some flexibility in how you want to extend the conda module to include parsl, but here is an example way to do it:\n\n```python\n\nLoad the Conda Module (needed everytime you use parsl)\n\nmodule load conda\nconda activate\n\nCreate a virtual env that uses the conda env as the system packages.\n\nOnly do the next line on initial set up:\n\npython -m venv --system-site-packages /path/to/your/virtualenv\n\nLoad the virtual env (every time):\n\nsource /path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/activate\n\nInstall parsl (only once)\n\npip install parsl\n\n```\n\nUsing Parsl on Polaris",

For performance, it will likely be necessary to ensure that each application runs on a distinct set of CPU resources and/or targets specific GPUs. One can provide a list of CPUs using the --cpu-bind option, which when combined with CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES provides a user with specifying exactly which CPU and GPU resources to run each application on. In the example below, four instances of the application are simultaneously running on a single node. In the first instance, the application is spawning MPI ranks 0-7 on CPUs 24-31 and using GPU 0. This mapping is based on output from the nvidia-smi topo -m command and pairs CPUs with the closest GPU.\n\n```bash\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:24:25:26:27:28:29:30:31 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:16:17:18:19:20:21:22:23 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:8:9:10:11:12:13:14:15 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=3\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:0:1:2:3:4:5:6:7 ./hello_affinity &\n\nwait\n```\n\nCompute Node Access to the Internet\n\nCurrently, the only access the internet is via a proxy.

                "Running GPU-enabled Applications\n\nGPU-enabled applications will similarly run on the compute nodes using the above example script.\n- The environment variable MPICH_GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED=1 needs to be set if your application requires MPI-GPU support whereby the MPI library sends and receives data directly from GPU buffers. In this case, it will be important to have the craype-accel-nvidia80 module loaded both when compiling your application and during runtime to correctly link against a GPU Transport Layer (GTL) MPI library. Otherwise, you'll likely see GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED is requested, but GTL library is not linked errors during runtime.\n- If running on a specific GPU or subset of GPUs is desired, then the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable can be used. For example, if one only wanted an application to access the first two GPUs on a node, then setting CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 could be used.\n\nBinding MPI ranks to GPUs\n\nThe Cray MPI on Polaris does not currently support binding MPI ranks to GPUs. For applications that need this support, this instead can be handled by use of a small helper script that will appropriately set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES for each MPI rank. One example is available here where each MPI rank is similarly bound to a single GPU with round-robin assignment.\n\nA example set_affinity_gpu_polaris.sh script follows where GPUs are assigned round-robin to MPI ranks.\n\n```bash\n\n!/bin/bash -l\n\nnum_gpus=4\n\nneed to assign GPUs in reverse order due to topology",

We can use these values to specify our job requirements.\n\n**-l select=1**: This specifies that we need 1 node for our job.\n**-l walltime=60:00**: This specifies the maximum wall clock time required for our job, which is 1 hour in this case.\n**-l filesystems=home:grand:swift**: This specifies the file systems that are available to our job. In this case, we have home, grand, and swift file systems.\n\n**Final Answer:** <ANSWER>: To specify job requirements using qsub, you can use options such as -l select=<number_of_nodes>, -l walltime=<wall_clock_time>, and -l filesystems=<file_systems>."

In this case, it will be important to have the craype-accel-nvidia80 module loaded both when compiling your application and during runtime to correctly link against a GPU Transport Layer (GTL) MPI library. Otherwise, you'll likely see GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED is requested, but GTL library is not linked errors during runtime.\n- If running on a specific GPU or subset of GPUs is desired, then the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable can be used.

The `mig_config.json` file defines groups with GPUs, whether MIG is enabled for each group, and instances within those groups.\n\nFrom the `nvidia-smi -L` output, we can see that there are multiple MIG IDs listed, which suggests that MIG is being used to create multiple virtual GPUs (vGPUs) from a single physical GPU.\n\nNow, let's analyze the purpose of MIG in this computing system. The main purpose of MIG is to enable multiple isolated and secure environments on a single GPU. This allows for better resource utilization, improved security, and increased flexibility in deploying workloads that require different configurations or dependencies.\n\nIn the provided context, we can see that each group has its own set of GPUs and instances, which suggests that MIG is being used to create separate virtual environments for each group.

The provided context shows that there are two groups of MIG-enabled GPUs: \"group1\" and \"group2\". Each group has its own set of GPUs, instances, and mig_enabled flag.\n##begin_quote##\n{ \n   \"group1\": { \n     \"gpus\": [0,1], \n     \"mig_enabled\": true, \n     \"instances\": {\"7g.40gb\": [\"4c.7g.40gb\", \"3c.7g.40gb\"] } \n   }, \n   \"group2\": { \n     \"gpus\": [2,3], \n     \"mig_enabled\": true, \n     \"instances\": {\"4g.20gb\": [\"2c.4g.20gb\", \"2c.4g.20gb\"], \"2g.10gb\": [\"2g.10gb\"] } \n   }\n}##end_quote##\n2.

The output shows that each MIG-enabled GPU is assigned a unique CUDA context, and the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable is set to the corresponding MIG ID.\n5. Therefore, when using multiple CUDA contexts simultaneously with MIG-enabled GPUs, the default behavior is that each MIG-enabled GPU is assigned its own unique CUDA context.\n\nFinal Answer:\n<ANSWER>: Each MIG-enabled GPU is assigned its own unique CUDA context."

Its main applications are electronic structure calculations of molecular, quasi-2D and solid-state systems. Variational Monte Carlo (VMC), diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) and a number of other advanced QMC algorithms are implemented. Orbital space auxiliary field QMC (AFQMC) has recently been added. By directly solving the Schrodinger equation, QMC methods offer greater accuracy than methods such as density functional theory, but at a trade-off of much greater computational expense.\n\nPrebuilt executables are provided at /soft/applications/qmcpack.\nThe directory of each installation also includes a job submission script example qmcpack-polaris.job.\nUpdate build recipe is provided on GitHub.",

The values in this column seem to be varying, but there doesn't appear to be any obvious pattern.\n\nHowever, if I look at the system's performance metrics (e.g., MiB), I notice that some of the values are increasing or decreasing in a way that might be related to the '.saxpy' column. For example, in the first row, the '.saxpy' value is 0 and the MiB value is 84,13MiB. In the second row, the '.saxpy' value is also 0, but the MiB value has decreased to 8,363MiB.\n\n##begin_quote##\n|    0    0    0      17,480      C    .saxpy                          84,13MiB |\n|    0    0    1      17,481      C    .saxpy                          8,363MiB |\n##end_quote##\n\nThis pattern continues throughout the table. It appears that when the '.saxpy' value is 0 or 1, the MiB value tends to decrease, while when it's 2 or 3, the MiB value tends to increase.\n\nBased on this analysis, I would conclude that the '.saxpy' column is related to the system's performance in a way that affects memory usage (MiB). When the '.saxpy' value is low (0 or 1), the system seems to be using less memory, and when it's higher (2 or 3), the system appears to be using more memory.\n\n<ANSWER>: The '.saxpy' column relates to the system's performance by influencing memory usage (MiB)."

Click on Add Server:\n\nGive your server a name, select Client/Server, localhost, and a TCP port (8000 in this example)\n\nClick \"Configure\". In the next window there is an option to set up how ParaView server will be launched, and the default is \"Manual\". Leave it on \"Manual\" and click \"Save\".\n\nYou will use these settings when establishing the connection.\n\nLaunching the ParaView server on Polaris\n\nYou can launch an interactive session on Polaris compute nodes with the following command (adjust parameters as needed to match your allocation, desired number of nodes, queue, walltime, and filesystems):\n\nshell\nqsub -l walltime=01:00:00 -l select=2 -A yourallocation -q debug -I -l filesystems=home:grand\n\nWhen the job starts you will receive a prompt on your head node like this:",

Obviously, that gets tedious for large jobs.\n\nIf you want to control the location of a few nodes, for example 2 out of 64, but the rest don't matter, you can do something like this: -l select=1:vnode=<node name1>+1:vnode=<node name2>+62:system=foo\n\nEvery node has a PBS resource called tier0 with a rack identifier and tier1 with a dragonfly group identifieer.  If you want all your nodes grouped in a rack, you can add the group specifier -l select=8:system=foo,place=scatter:group=tier0.  If you wanted everything in the same dragonfly group, replace tier0 with tier1.  Note that you have to also explicitly specify the place when you use group.  If you wanted a specific rack or dragonfly group instead of any of them, you are back to the select: -l select 10:tier0=x3001-g0.\n\nNetwork: Rack and Dragonfly Group Mappings",

Add the dependencies you want to use in your project using the `add` command:\n```\njulia -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(\"DependencyName\")'\n```\nReplace \"DependencyName\" with the actual name of the package you want to add.\n\n5. To enable project-specific dependencies, run:\n```\njulia -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.activate(\".\")'\n```\nThis will activate your project's environment and make it use the packages you've added specifically for that project.\n\n<ANSWER>: Enable project-specific dependencies by setting JULIA_DEPOT_PATH, initializing the package manager, adding dependencies, and activating the project environment."

It has a syntax familiar to users of many other\ntechnical computing environments. Designed at MIT to tackle large-scale\npartial-differential equation simulation and distributed linear algebra, Julia\nfeatures a robust ecosystem of tools for\noptimization,\nstatistics, parallel programming, and data\nvisualization. Julia is actively developed by the Julia\nLabs team at MIT and in\nindustry, along with hundreds of domain-expert\nscientists and programmers worldwide.\n\nContributing\n\nThis guide is a first draft of the Julia documentation for Polaris. If you have any\nsuggestions or contributions, please open a pull request or contact us by\nopening a ticket at the ALCF Helpdesk.\n\nJulia Installation\n\nWe encourage users interested in using Julia on Polaris to install in their home or project directories at this time. Using the official Julia 1.9 binaries from the Julia\nwebpage is recommended.\nJuliaup provides a convenient way to\ninstall Julia and manage the various Julia versions. The default installation will install julia, juliaup, and other commands in a ${HOME}/.julia directory and update profile files like .bashrc to update PATH to include that directory. One can customize the installation to change these defaults.\n\nbash\nmodule load craype-accel-nvidia80\ncurl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh",

For this reason, it is recommended to use start_method=\"spawn\" on Polaris when using the MpiExecLauncher as is shown in the example config above.  Alternatively, another solution is to use the GNUParallelLauncher which uses GNU Parallel to spawn processes.  GNU Parallel can be loaded in your environment with the command module load gnu-parallel.  Both of these approaches will circumvent the hang issue from using fork.\n\nUpdates\n\nFor parsl versions after July 2023, the address passed in the HighThroughputExecutor needs to be set to address = address_by_interface(\"bond0\").

While the PGI compilers are available in this programming environment, it should be noted they are actually symlinks to the corresponding NVIDIA compilers.\npgcc -> nvc\npgc++ -> nvc++\npgf90 -> nvfortran\npgfortran -> nvfortran\nWhile nvcc is the traditional CUDA C and CUDA C++ compiler for NVIDIA GPUs, the nvc, nvc++, and nvfortran compilers additionally target CPUs.\n\nNVHPC SDK Directory Structure\n\nUsers migrating from CUDA toolkits to the NVHPC SDK may find it beneficial to review the directory structure of the hpc-sdk directory to find the location of commonly used libraries (including math libraries for the CPU). With the PrgEnv-nvhpc module loaded, the NVIDIA_PATH environment variable can be used to locate the path to various NVIDIA tools, libraries, and examples.\n\ncompiler/bin - cuda-gdb, ncu, nsys, ...",

For this reason, it is recommended to use start_method=\"spawn\" on Polaris when using the MpiExecLauncher as is shown in the example config above.  Alternatively, another solution is to use the GNUParallelLauncher which uses GNU Parallel to spawn processes.  GNU Parallel can be loaded in your environment with the command module load gnu-parallel.  Both of these approaches will circumvent the hang issue from using fork.\n\nUpdates\n\nFor parsl versions after July 2023, the address passed in the HighThroughputExecutor needs to be set to address = address_by_interface(\"bond0\").  With parsl versions prior to July 2023, it was recommended to use address = address_by_hostname() on Polaris, but with later versions this will not work on Polaris (or any other machine).",

A Balsam Site runs on a node with access to the job scheduler, where it can submit and monitor jobs. Overall job state is aggregated on the Balsam Server, making job data from all Sites accessible from any individual site (or the user's laptop), via the command-line interface or the Python API. To get information on how to use the command line tool, you can type balsam --help in your shell.\n\nFull documentation for Balsam is available online.\n\nBalsam requires Python 3.7+. To install Balsam on Polaris, first set up a virtual Python environment:\n\nshell\nmodule load conda\nconda activate base\npython -m venv env\nsource env/bin/activate\npip install --upgrade pip\npip install --pre balsam\n\nTo use Balsam, users need an account on the Balsam server.  Users can get an account by contacting the ALCF Help Desk.  Once a user has an account, they can login and make a new site.  A Balsam site is a project space for your workflow. You will be prompted to select what machine (Polaris) you are working on when creating a new site:\n\nshell\nbalsam login\nbalsam site init -n new-site new-site\ncd new-site\nbalsam site start\n\nSee the Balsam documentation for full details.",

        "cot_answer": "To answer this question, I will provide step-by-step reasoning on how to determine the purpose of MPI in this script.\n\n1. First, let's identify where MPI is used in the script. The line `MPI.Init()` suggests that MPI is being initialized.\n2. Next, we can look at the context where MPI is used. In this case, it appears that MPI is being used to run a job on multiple nodes with multiple ranks per node.\n\n##begin_quote##\nPBS -l select=1:system=polaris\nPBS -l place=scatter\nPBS -l walltime=0:30:00\nPBS -l filesystems=home:grand\nPBS -q debug\nPBS -A PROJECT\ncd ${PBS_O_WORKDIR}\nMPI example w/ 4 MPI ranks per node spread evenly across cores\n##end_quote##\n\nThis suggests that the script is designed to run on a distributed computing system, such as Polaris, with multiple nodes and ranks.\n\n3. Finally, we can look at how the script uses MPI to determine its purpose. In this case, the script appears to be using MPI to distribute the workload across multiple nodes and ranks, allowing it to generate more points per rank than it could on a single node.\n\nBased on this analysis, I conclude that the purpose of MPI in this script is to enable distributed computing and parallelize the generation of random points for approximating pi.\n\n<ANSWER>: The purpose of MPI in this script is to enable distributed computing and parallelize the generation of random points for approximating pi."

For example:\n- `select=1:system=polaris` specifies that the job should be executed on the Polaris system with one node.\n- `place=scatter` specifies how to distribute the job across nodes (in this case, scatter).\n- `walltime=0:30:00` specifies a time limit for the job (30 minutes).\n- `filesystems=home:grand` specifies which filesystems are available to the job (home and grand).\n- `PBS -q debug` specifies that the job should be executed in the debug queue.\n- `PBS -A PROJECT` specifies that the job is part of a project.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze how these options affect execution**\nBased on these options, we can infer how they will affect the execution of the program:\n- The `select=1:system=polaris` option ensures that the job is executed on Polaris with one node.\n- The `place=scatter` option distributes the job across nodes in a scatter manner, which means that each node will execute a portion of the job.\n- The `walltime=0:30:00` option sets a time limit for the job, after which it will be terminated if not completed.\n- The `filesystems=home:grand` option provides access to home and grand filesystems for the job.\n- The `PBS -q debug` option executes the job in the debug queue, which may have specific settings or constraints.\n- The `PBS -A PROJECT` option specifies that the job is part of a project.\n\n**Final Answer**\n<ANSWER>: The PBS options used in the job submission script affect the execution of the program by specifying the system, node distribution, time limit, filesystems, queue, and project affiliation."

                "Use XLA compilation on your code.  XLA is the Accelerated Linear Algebra library that is available in tensorFlow and critical in software like JAX.  XLA will compile a tf.Graph object, generated with tf.function or similar, and perform optimizations like operation-fusion.  XLA can give impressive performance boosts with almost no user changes except to set an environment variable TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2.  If your code is complex, or has dynamically sized tensors (tensors where the shape changes every iteration), XLA can be detrimental: the overhead for compiling functions can be large enough to mitigate performance improvements.  XLA is particularly powerful when combined with reduced precision, yielding speedups > 100% in some models.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nTensorFlow is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with tensorFlow has been seen with horovod in particular.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation.

                "PyTorch Best Practices on Polaris\n\nSingle Node Performance\n\nWhen running PyTorch applications, we have found the following practices to be generally, if not universally, useful and encourage you to try some of these techniques to boost performance of your own applications.\n\nUse Reduced Precision. Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with PyTorch operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the PyTorch Automatic Mixed Precision package (AMP), as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  In PyTorch, users generally need to manage casting and loss scaling manually,  though context managers and function decorators can provide easy tools to do this.\n\nPyTorch has a JIT module as well as backends to support op fusion, similar to TensorFlow's tf.function tools.  However, PyTorch JIT capabilities are newer and may not yield performance improvements.  Please see TorchScript for more information.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nPyTorch is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with PyTorch has been seen with both DDP and Horovod.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation or the Distributed Data Parallel documentation.  Some Polaris-specific details that may be helpful to you:",

Since the default `TMPDIR` on Polaris is set to a temp directory that only exists on the head node of a job, we need to set `TMPDIR` to a local directory on each compute node.\n\nThis is because the object files created by the nvcc compiler will be stored in this temporary directory, and if it's not set to a local directory, these files may not be accessible or may be lost when the job finishes. By setting `TMPDIR` to `/local/scratch`, we ensure that these temporary files are stored on each compute node, making them accessible and persistent throughout the job.\n\n<ANSWER>: It is necessary to set a local directory for `TMPDIR` in a job on Polaris because the default `TMPDIR` only exists on the head node of a job, and CUDA.jl uses this directory to store temporary files."

The context mentions a \"simple example to test gpu-aware MPI on multiple nodes\" and provides a link to access it.\n\n##begin_quote##\nA simple example to test gpu-aware MPI on multiple nodes is available here.\n##end_quote##\n\nFrom this context, I can infer that the example is related to running parallel computations using GPU-aware MPI. The phrase \"gpu-aware MPI\" suggests that the example involves using Message Passing Interface (MPI) with Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), which is a common approach for running parallel computations.\n\nTherefore, based on the context, I conclude that:\n\n<ANSWER>: Yes, this example is related to running parallel computations."

                "Containers on Polaris\n\nPolaris, powered by NVIDIA A100 GPUs, benefits from container-based workloads for seamless compatibility across NVIDIA systems. This guide details the use of containers on Polaris, including custom container creation, large-scale execution, and common pitfalls.\n\nApptainer Setup\n\nPolaris employs Apptainer (formerly known as Singularity) for container management. To set up Apptainer, run:\n\nbash\nmodule use /soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/install/modulefiles/Core\nmodule load apptainer\napptainer version #1.2.2\n\nThe Apptainer version on Polaris is 1.2.2. Detailed user documentation is available here\n\nBuilding from Docker or Argonne GitHub Container Registry\n\nContainers on Polaris can be built by writing Dockerfiles on a local machine and then publish the container to DockerHub, or by directly building them on ALCF compute node by writing an Apptainer recipe file. If you prefer to use existing containers, you can pull them from various registries like DockerHub and run them on Polaris.\n\nSince Docker requires root privileges, which users do not have on Polaris, existing Docker containers must be converted to Apptainer. To build a Docker-based container on Polaris, use the following as an example:",

One should then see the Makefile lammps-<version>/src/MAKE/MACHINES/Makefile.polaris in recent versions that can be used as a starting point for compilation on Polaris. Copies of Makefiles for building with the GPU/KOKKOS package using CUDA for GPU support with the GNU/NVHPC compiler are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo here. For older versions of LAMMPS, you may need to take an existing Makefile (e.g. Makefile.mpi) for your specific version of LAMMPS and edit the top portion appropratiately to create a new Makefile.polaris.\n\nKOKKOS package and GNU compilers\n\nThe following modules are useful for this particular build. Note, the cmake module is not required if using the GNU Makefile procedure to build LAMMPS. The initial module restore is just setting the default environment as the starting point. Users may find it useful to copy these module commands into a small helper script to assist with compiling and running LAMMPS (e.g. setup_lammps_gnu.sh).\n\n```\nmodule restore\nmodule load craype-accel-nvidia80\nmodule swap PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-gnu\n\nmodule use /soft/modulefiles\nmodule load cudatoolkit-standalone\n\nmodule load spack-pe-base cmake\n```\n\nThe top portion of Makefile.polaris_gnu_kokkos used to build LAMMPS with the KOKKOS package using GNU as the host-side compiler is shown as an example.\n\n```",

        "cot_answer": "Here's my step-by-step reasoning to answer the question:\n\nTo determine why I should prefer using `venv` over `#!bash --user installs` for creating Python environments, let's first understand what each approach does.\n\n##begin_quote##\nCloning the Anaconda environment, or using venv are both more flexible and transparent when compared to #!bash --user installs.\n##end_quote##\n\nFrom this quote, it seems that `venv` is considered a more flexible and transparent way of creating Python environments. This suggests that `venv` might be a better choice than `#!bash --user installs`.\n\nAnother important point is the need to remove the location from `#!bash $PATH` if you deactivate the base Anaconda environment or unload the module. This implies that using `#!bash --user installs` requires more manual maintenance and cleanup, which can be error-prone.\n\nIn contrast, `venv` provides a self-contained Python environment that is easy to create, use, and destroy without affecting the system's Python installation. This makes it a more convenient and reliable choice for creating Python environments.\n\nTherefore, I should prefer using `venv` over `#!bash --user installs` for creating Python environments because it offers greater flexibility, transparency, and convenience.\n\n<ANSWER>: Use venv over #!bash -- user installs for creating Python environments."

Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with TensorFlow operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the tf.keras.mixed_precision Policy, as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  If you use a custom training loop (and not keras.Model.fit), you will also need to apply loss scaling.\n\nUse TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.  Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.  When possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention.",

For this reason, it is recommended to use start_method=\"spawn\" on Polaris when using the MpiExecLauncher as is shown in the example config above.  Alternatively, another solution is to use the GNUParallelLauncher which uses GNU Parallel to spawn processes.  GNU Parallel can be loaded in your environment with the command module load gnu-parallel.  Both of these approaches will circumvent the hang issue from using fork.\n\nUpdates\n\nFor parsl versions after July 2023, the address passed in the HighThroughputExecutor needs to be set to address = address_by_interface(\"bond0\").

                "Use XLA compilation on your code.  XLA is the Accelerated Linear Algebra library that is available in tensorFlow and critical in software like JAX.  XLA will compile a tf.Graph object, generated with tf.function or similar, and perform optimizations like operation-fusion.  XLA can give impressive performance boosts with almost no user changes except to set an environment variable TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2.  If your code is complex, or has dynamically sized tensors (tensors where the shape changes every iteration), XLA can be detrimental: the overhead for compiling functions can be large enough to mitigate performance improvements.  XLA is particularly powerful when combined with reduced precision, yielding speedups > 100% in some models.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nTensorFlow is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with tensorFlow has been seen with horovod in particular.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation.  Some polaris specific details that may be helpful to you:\n\nCPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.

A Balsam Site runs on a node with access to the job scheduler, where it can submit and monitor jobs. Overall job state is aggregated on the Balsam Server, making job data from all Sites accessible from any individual site (or the user's laptop), via the command-line interface or the Python API. To get information on how to use the command line tool, you can type balsam --help in your shell.\n\nFull documentation for Balsam is available online.\n\nBalsam requires Python 3.7+. To install Balsam on Polaris, first set up a virtual Python environment:\n\nshell\nmodule load conda\nconda activate base\npython -m venv env\nsource env/bin/activate\npip install --upgrade pip\npip install --pre balsam\n\nTo use Balsam, users need an account on the Balsam server.  Users can get an account by contacting the ALCF Help Desk.  Once a user has an account, they can login and make a new site.  A Balsam site is a project space for your workflow. You will be prompted to select what machine (Polaris) you are working on when creating a new site:\n\nshell\nbalsam login\nbalsam site init -n new-site new-site\ncd new-site\nbalsam site start\n\nSee the Balsam documentation for full details.",

It highlights that pmap is sufficient for using multiple GPUs on a single node, but if more complex scaling is needed, mpi4Jax can be used.\n\n**Step 2: Define what we mean by \"scaling\"**\nIn this context, scaling refers to the ability to use multiple GPUs and nodes to accelerate computations. We want to compare how pmap and mpi4Jax achieve this scaling.\n\n**Step 3: Understand the key differences between pmap and mpi4Jax**\n\n##begin_quote##\nJax has intrinsic scaling tools to use multiple GPUs on a single node, via the pmap function.  If this is sufficient for your needs, excellent.  If not, another alternative is to use the newer package mpi4jax.\n##end_quote##\n\nFrom this quote, we can see that pmap is a built-in JAX tool for scaling to multiple GPUs on a single node. On the other hand, mpi4Jax is a separate package that provides more advanced scaling capabilities.\n\n**Step 4: Summarize the key differences**\n\nIn summary, pmap is a simple, built-in JAX tool for scaling to multiple GPUs on a single node, while mpi4Jax is a more advanced package that allows for scaling across multiple nodes and GPUs. To achieve this level of scaling with pmap, you would need to use environment variables like `XLA_FLAGS=\"--xla_gpu_force_compilation_parallelism=1\"`.\n\n**Final Answer**\n<ANSWER>: $mpi4Jax provides more advanced scaling capabilities than pmap, allowing for scaling across multiple nodes and GPUs."

The `target_device` variable likely represents the desired device (e.g., GPU or CPU) for JAX computations.\n4.

Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with PyTorch operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the PyTorch Automatic Mixed Precision package (AMP), as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.

In the context, we see that `jax.default_device(target_device)` sets the default device for JAX operations.\n2. When creating an array `a = jnp.zeros((3, 3))`, JAX uses the default device set earlier to create the array on that device.\n3. The print statement shows that initially, the device of `a` is `{target_device}`.\n4. When calling the `foo()` function with input `a`, JAX's `jit` compiler compiles and executes the code on a specific device (which might be different from the default device).\n5. Since `foo()` is likely using JAX's `jit` compiler, it will execute on the device specified by the `target_device` parameter.\n6. The print statement after calling `foo()` shows that the device of `result` is `{target_device}` as well.\n\nTherefore, the device information changes because `foo()` executes on a different device than where `a` was created.\n\n<ANSWER>: The device information changes when calling the `foo()` function with input `a` because JAX's `jit` compiler compiles and executes the code on a specific device."

The -g -G option pair must be passed to NVCC when an application is compiled for ease of debugging with CUDA-GDB; for example,\nnvcc -g -G foo.cu -o foo\nUsing this line to compile the CUDA application foo.cu\n* forces -O0 compilation, with the exception of very limited dead-code eliminations and register-spilling optimizations.\n* makes the compiler include debug information in the executable\n\nRunning CUDA-gdb on Polaris compute nodes\n\nStart an interactive job mode on Polaris as follows:\n\n```\n$ qsub -I -l select=1 -l walltime=1:00:00",

This consists of running the ParaView client on your local resource, and the ParaView server on the Polaris compute nodes. The ParaView client needs to first be installed on your local resource, and needs to match the version that you run on Polaris.\n\nThere are multiple versions of ParaView installed on Polaris. To find the versions of ParaView currently available on Polaris run the following command on a login node: \nmodule use /soft/modulefiles\nmodule avail paraview\n\nBinary and source packages of the ParaView client for Linux, MacOS, and Windows are available from the ParaView Download Page.\n\nConnecting to the ParaView server on Polaris\n\nThis section describes how to launch the ParaView server on Polaris from a local ParaView client.\n\nStart ParaView Client\n\nFirst, launch the ParaView client on your local resource. You will need to configure some server settings in the client. This initial set up should only need to be done once, and can be reused each time you want to run ParaView on Polaris.\n\nServer Configuration\n\n1.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.

To do this, you can use the following command:\n```\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=$PMI_LOCAL_RANK\n```\n\n4. This will set the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable to the value of PMI_LOCAL_RANK, which corresponds to a specific GPU on the node.\n\n5.

CUDA-GDB is an extension to GDB, the GNU Project debugger. The tool provides developers with a mechanism for debugging CUDA applications running on actual hardware. This enables developers to debug applications without the potential variations introduced by simulation and emulation environments.\n\nStep-by-step guide\n\nDebug Compilation\n\nNVCC, the NVIDIA CUDA compiler driver, provides a mechanism for generating the debugging information necessary for CUDA-GDB to work properly. The -g -G option pair must be passed to NVCC when an application is compiled for ease of debugging with CUDA-GDB; for example,\nnvcc -g -G foo.cu -o foo\nUsing this line to compile the CUDA application foo.cu\n* forces -O0 compilation, with the exception of very limited dead-code eliminations and register-spilling optimizations.\n* makes the compiler include debug information in the executable\n\nRunning CUDA-gdb on Polaris compute nodes\n\nStart an interactive job mode on Polaris as follows:\n\n```\n$ qsub -I -l select=1 -l walltime=1:00:00",

                "Use XLA compilation on your code.  XLA is the Accelerated Linear Algebra library that is available in tensorFlow and critical in software like JAX.  XLA will compile a tf.Graph object, generated with tf.function or similar, and perform optimizations like operation-fusion.  XLA can give impressive performance boosts with almost no user changes except to set an environment variable TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2.  If your code is complex, or has dynamically sized tensors (tensors where the shape changes every iteration), XLA can be detrimental: the overhead for compiling functions can be large enough to mitigate performance improvements.  XLA is particularly powerful when combined with reduced precision, yielding speedups > 100% in some models.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nTensorFlow is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with tensorFlow has been seen with horovod in particular.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation.  Some polaris specific details that may be helpful to you:\n\nCPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.  In particular, we encourage users to try their scaling measurements with the following settings:\n\nSet the environment variable NCCL_COLLNET_ENABLE=1\n\nSet the environment varialbe NCCL_NET_GDR_LEVEL=PHB",

This guide details the use of containers on Polaris, including custom container creation, large-scale execution, and common pitfalls.\n\nApptainer Setup\n\nPolaris employs Apptainer (formerly known as Singularity) for container management. To set up Apptainer, run:\n\nbash\nmodule use /soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/install/modulefiles/Core\nmodule load apptainer\napptainer version #1.2.2\n\nThe Apptainer version on Polaris is 1.2.2. Detailed user documentation is available here\n\nBuilding from Docker or Argonne GitHub Container Registry\n\nContainers on Polaris can be built by writing Dockerfiles on a local machine and then publish the container to DockerHub, or by directly building them on ALCF compute node by writing an Apptainer recipe file. If you prefer to use existing containers, you can pull them from various registries like DockerHub and run them on Polaris.\n\nSince Docker requires root privileges, which users do not have on Polaris, existing Docker containers must be converted to Apptainer. To build a Docker-based container on Polaris, use the following as an example:",

Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with TensorFlow operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the tf.keras.mixed_precision Policy, as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  If you use a custom training loop (and not keras.Model.fit), you will also need to apply loss scaling.\n\nUse TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.  Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.  When possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention.",

                "PyTorch Best Practices on Polaris\n\nSingle Node Performance\n\nWhen running PyTorch applications, we have found the following practices to be generally, if not universally, useful and encourage you to try some of these techniques to boost performance of your own applications.\n\nUse Reduced Precision. Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with PyTorch operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the PyTorch Automatic Mixed Precision package (AMP), as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  In PyTorch, users generally need to manage casting and loss scaling manually,  though context managers and function decorators can provide easy tools to do this.\n\nPyTorch has a JIT module as well as backends to support op fusion, similar to TensorFlow's tf.function tools.  However, PyTorch JIT capabilities are newer and may not yield performance improvements.  Please see TorchScript for more information.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nPyTorch is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with PyTorch has been seen with both DDP and Horovod.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation or the Distributed Data Parallel documentation.  Some Polaris-specific details that may be helpful to you:",

For performance, it will likely be necessary to ensure that each application runs on a distinct set of CPU resources and/or targets specific GPUs. One can provide a list of CPUs using the --cpu-bind option, which when combined with CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES provides a user with specifying exactly which CPU and GPU resources to run each application on. In the example below, four instances of the application are simultaneously running on a single node. In the first instance, the application is spawning MPI ranks 0-7 on CPUs 24-31 and using GPU 0. This mapping is based on output from the nvidia-smi topo -m command and pairs CPUs with the closest GPU.\n\n```bash\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:24:25:26:27:28:29:30:31 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:16:17:18:19:20:21:22:23 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:8:9:10:11:12:13:14:15 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=3\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:0:1:2:3:4:5:6:7 ./hello_affinity &\n\nwait\n```\n\nCompute Node Access to the Internet\n\nCurrently, the only access the internet is via a proxy.

However, it's not enough to just check this variable because some environment variables can still deactivate CUDA awareness even if the initial check was positive. These environment variables are specific to OpenMPI and other MPI implementations.\n\nThe purpose of checking these environment variables is to ensure that CUDA awareness is indeed enabled or disabled based on the values of these variables. If any of these variables have a value of '0', it means CUDA awareness should be disabled, regardless of the initial check.\n\nTherefore, the purpose of checking CUDA aware support is to provide a more comprehensive and accurate determination of whether CUDA awareness is enabled or disabled, taking into account various environment variables that can influence this decision.\n\n<ANSWER>: The purpose of checking CUDA aware support is to ensure a comprehensive and accurate determination of whether CUDA awareness is enabled or disabled, considering various environment variables."

The context shows that there are several environment variables that can be used to deactivate CUDA-aware support.\n\nFirst, it checks if the \"OMPI_MCA_mpi_cuda_support\" variable is set to 0. If it is, then CUDA_AWARE_SUPPORT is set to .FALSE.. This is shown in the following code:\n\n##begin_quote##\nCALL GET_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE(\"OMPI_MCA_mpi_cuda_support\", ENVVAR_VALUE, STATUS=ENVVAR_STAT)\nIF (ENVVAR_STAT==0 .AND. ENVVAR_VALUE=='0') CUDA_AWARE_SUPPORT = .FALSE.\n##end_quote##\n\nThis means that if the \"OMPI_MCA_mpi_cuda_support\" variable is set to 0, then CUDA-aware support will be deactivated.\n\nNext, it checks if the \"OMPI_MCA_opal_cuda_support\" variable is set to 0. If it is, then CUDA_AWARE_SUPPORT is also set to .FALSE.. This is shown in the following code:\n\n##begin_quote##\nCALL GET_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE(\"OMPI_MCA_opal_cuda_support\", ENVVAR_VALUE, STATUS=ENVVAR_STAT)\nIF (ENVVAR_STAT==0 .AND. ENVVAR_VALUE=='0') CUDA_AWARE_SUPPORT = .FALSE.\n##end_quote##\n\nThis means that if either the \"OMPI_MCA_mpi_cuda_support\" or \"OMPI_MCA_opal_cuda_support\" variable is set to 0, then CUDA-aware support will be deactivated.\n\nFinally, it checks if the \"MV2_USE_CUDA\", \"MPICH_RDMA_ENABLED_CUDA\", or \"PMPI_GPU_AWARE\" variables are set to 0. If any of these variables are set to 0, then CUDA_AWARE_SUPPORT is also set to .FALSE.. This is shown in the following code:\n\n##begin_quote##\nCALL GET_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE(\"MV2_USE_CUDA\", ENVVAR_VALUE, STATUS=ENVVAR_STAT)\nIF (ENVVAR_STAT==0 .AND. ENVVAR_VALUE=='0') CUDA_AWARE_SUPPORT = .FALSE.\nCALL GET_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE(\"MPICH_RDMA_ENABLED_CUDA\", ENVVAR_VALUE, STATUS=ENVVAR_STAT)\nIF (ENVVAR_STAT==0 .AND.

If any of these variables is set to 0, then CUDA_AWARE_SUPPORT is set to .FALSE., which deactivates CUDA-aware support.\n\n<ANSWER>: The final answer is that OpenMPI deactivates CUDA-aware support by checking the values of several environment variables, including \"OMPI_MCA_mpi_cuda_support\", \"OMPI_MCA_opal_cuda_support\", \"MV2_USE_CUDA\", \"MPICH_RDMA_ENABLED_CUDA\", and \"PMPI_GPU_AWARE\"."

If your build system does require GPUs, you cannot yet compile on the Polaris login nodes, as they do not currently have GPUs installed. You may in this case compile your applications on the Polaris compute nodes. Do this by submitting an interactive single-node job, or running your build system in a batch job.\n\nHome File System\n\nIs it helpful to realize that there is a single HOME filesystem for users that can be accessed from the login and computes of each production resource at ALCF. Thus, users should be mindful of modifications to their environments (e.g. .bashrc) that may cause issues to arise due to differences between the systems.\n\nCray Programming Environment\n\nThe Cray Programming Environment (PE) uses three compiler wrappers for building software. These compiler wrappers should be used when building MPI-enabled applications.\n\ncc - C compiler\n\nCC - C++ compiler\n\nftn - Fortran compiler\n\nEach of these wrappers can select a specific vendor compiler based on the PrgEnv module loaded in the environment.

In the code snippet, we see several environment variables being checked: OMPI_MCA_mpi_cuda_support, OMPI_MCA_opal_cuda_support, MV2_USE_CUDA, MPICH_RDMA_ENABLED_CUDA, and PMPI_GPU_AWARE.\n3. The condition for disabling CUDA aware support is when the value of these environment variables is '0'.\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that any of these environment variables set to '0' can be used to disable CUDA aware support.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<ANSWER>: OMPI_MCA_mpi_cuda_support, OMPI_MCA_opal_cuda_support, MV2_USE_CUDA, MPICH_RDMA_ENABLED_CUDA, or PMPI_GPU_AWARE."

One should then see the Makefile lammps-<version>/src/MAKE/MACHINES/Makefile.polaris in recent versions that can be used as a starting point for compilation on Polaris. Copies of Makefiles for building with the GPU/KOKKOS package using CUDA for GPU support with the GNU/NVHPC compiler are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo here. For older versions of LAMMPS, you may need to take an existing Makefile (e.g. Makefile.mpi) for your specific version of LAMMPS and edit the top portion appropratiately to create a new Makefile.polaris.\n\nKOKKOS package and GNU compilers\n\nThe following modules are useful for this particular build. Note, the cmake module is not required if using the GNU Makefile procedure to build LAMMPS. The initial module restore is just setting the default environment as the starting point. Users may find it useful to copy these module commands into a small helper script to assist with compiling and running LAMMPS (e.g. setup_lammps_gnu.sh).\n\n```\nmodule restore\nmodule load craype-accel-nvidia80\nmodule swap PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-gnu\n\nmodule use /soft/modulefiles\nmodule load cudatoolkit-standalone\n\nmodule load spack-pe-base cmake\n```\n\nThe top portion of Makefile.polaris_gnu_kokkos used to build LAMMPS with the KOKKOS package using GNU as the host-side compiler is shown as an example.\n\n```",

For this reason, it is recommended to use start_method=\"spawn\" on Polaris when using the MpiExecLauncher as is shown in the example config above.  Alternatively, another solution is to use the GNUParallelLauncher which uses GNU Parallel to spawn processes.  GNU Parallel can be loaded in your environment with the command module load gnu-parallel.  Both of these approaches will circumvent the hang issue from using fork.\n\nUpdates\n\nFor parsl versions after July 2023, the address passed in the HighThroughputExecutor needs to be set to address = address_by_interface(\"bond0\").  With parsl versions prior to July 2023, it was recommended to use address = address_by_hostname() on Polaris, but with later versions this will not work on Polaris (or any other machine).",

        "cot_answer": "To run GROMACS using PBS and multiple nodes, we can follow the steps outlined in the provided script. Here's a step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The first line of the script specifies the shell to use: `#!/bin/sh`. This is not relevant to running GROMACS on multiple nodes.\n2. The next lines specify the PBS options:\n\t* `PBS -l select=2:system=polaris`: This requests 2 nodes from the polaris system.\n\t* `PBS -l place=scatter`: This specifies that the job should be placed in a scattered manner, which is suitable for parallel jobs like GROMACS.\n\t* `PBS -l walltime=0:30:00`: This sets the maximum allowed runtime for the job to 30 minutes.\n3. The script then loads the necessary modules:\n\t* `module swap PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-gnu`: This swaps the programming environment from nvhpc to gnu.\n\t* `module load cudatoolkit-standalone/11.2.2`: This loads the CUDA toolkit version 11.2.2, which is required for GROMACS to run on GPUs.\n4. The script sets some environment variables:\n\t* `export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4`: This sets the number of OpenMP threads per rank to 4.\n5. Finally, the script runs GROMACS using `mpirun`:\n\t* `mpirun --np 8 /soft/applications/Gromacs/gromacs-2022.1/gmx_mpi ...`: This runs GROMACS on 8 MPI ranks (2 nodes x 4 ranks per node) with 4 OpenMP threads per rank.\n\nTo run GROMACS using PBS and multiple nodes, we can copy the script and modify it to suit our specific needs. For example, we might want to change the number of nodes or MPI ranks per node.\n\n<ANSWER>: Run the provided script as is, or modify it to suit your specific needs."

                "OpenMP\n\nOverview\n\nThe OpenMP API is an open standard for parallel programming. The specification document can be found here: https://www.openmp.org. The specification describes directives, runtime routines, and environment variables that allow an application developer to express parallelism (e.g. shared memory multiprocessing and device offloading). Many compiler vendors provide implementations of the OpenMP specification (https://www.openmp.org/specifications).\n\nSetting the environment to use OpenMP on Polaris\n\nMany of the programming environments available on Polaris have OpenMP support.\n\nmodule OpenMP CPU support? OpenMP GPU support? PrgEnv-nvhpc yes yes llvm yes yes PrgEnv-gnu yes no PrgEnv-cray yes yes*\n\nCurrently PrgEnv-cray is not recommended for OpenMP offload.\n\nBy default, the PrgEnv-nvhpc module is loaded. To switch to other modules, you can use module switch.\n\nUsing PrgEnv-nvhpc\n\nThis is loaded by default, so there's no need to load additional modules. You can confirm that it is loaded by running module list to check that PrgEnv-nvhpc is in the list.\n\nUsing LLVM\n\nTo use the LLVM module, load the following.\nmodule load mpiwrappers/cray-mpich-llvm\nmodule load cudatoolkit-standalone\n\nSee the the LLVM compiling page here for more information.\n\nUsing PrgEnv-gnu\n\nTo switch from PrgEnv-nvhpc to PrgEnv-gnu you can run:\n\nmodule switch PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-gnu",

Analyze the provided Makefile snippet to identify the command used for compilation.\n\nFrom the Makefile, I can see that the `CC` variable is set to `$((KOKKOS_ABSOLUTE_PATH)/bin/nvcc_wrapper`, which suggests that the compiler/linker settings are specified using the `CCFLAGS` and `LINKFLAGS` variables. The `make` command used for compilation is `make polaris_gnu_kokkos -j 32`.\n\n3.

CUDA-GDB is an extension to GDB, the GNU Project debugger. The tool provides developers with a mechanism for debugging CUDA applications running on actual hardware. This enables developers to debug applications without the potential variations introduced by simulation and emulation environments.\n\nStep-by-step guide\n\nDebug Compilation\n\nNVCC, the NVIDIA CUDA compiler driver, provides a mechanism for generating the debugging information necessary for CUDA-GDB to work properly. The -g -G option pair must be passed to NVCC when an application is compiled for ease of debugging with CUDA-GDB; for example,\nnvcc -g -G foo.cu -o foo\nUsing this line to compile the CUDA application foo.cu\n* forces -O0 compilation, with the exception of very limited dead-code eliminations and register-spilling optimizations.\n* makes the compiler include debug information in the executable\n\nRunning CUDA-gdb on Polaris compute nodes\n\nStart an interactive job mode on Polaris as follows:\n\n```\n$ qsub -I -l select=1 -l walltime=1:00:00",

Note that if you import mpi4py or horovod, and then do something like os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = hvd.local_rank(), it may not actually work!  You must set the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable prior to doing MPI.COMM_WORLD.init(), which is done in horovod.init() as well as implicitly in from mpi4py import MPI.   On Polaris specifically, you can use the environment variable PMI_LOCAL_RANK (as well as PMI_LOCAL_SIZE) to learn information about the node-local MPI ranks.\n\nTensorFlow Dataloaders\n\nAdditional information to be provided.",

The variable is named MPI_ARG, indicating that it's related to the MPI environment.\n2. The argument \"-n ${NTOTRANKS}\" sets the number of processes (-n) to the value stored in the NTOTRANKS variable.\n3. The argument \"--ppn ${NRANKS}\" specifies the number of processors per node (--ppn) to the value stored in the NRANKS variable.\n4. The argument \"--depth=${NDEPTH}\" sets the depth of the computation tree (--depth) to the value stored in the NDEPTH variable.\n5.

                "Example Programs and Makefiles for Polaris\n\nSeveral simple examples of building CPU and GPU-enabled codes on Polaris are available in the ALCF GettingStart repo for several programming models. If build your application is problematic for some reason (e.g. absence of a GPU), then users are encouraged to build and test applications directly on one of the Polaris compute nodes via an interactive job. The discussion below makes use of the NVHPC compilers in the default environment as illustrative examples. Similar examples for other compilers on Polaris are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo.\n\nCPU MPI+OpenMP Example\n\nOne of the first useful tasks with any new machine, scheduler, and job launcher is to ensure one is binding MPI ranks and OpenMP threads to the host cpu as intended. A simple HelloWorld MPI+OpenMP example is available here to get started with.\n\nThe application can be straightforwardly compiled using the Cray compiler wrappers.\nCC -fopenmp main.cpp -o hello_affinity\n\nThe executable hello_affinity can then be launched in a job script (or directly in shell of interactive job) using mpiexec as discussed here.\n\n```\n\n!/bin/sh\n\nPBS -l select=1:system=polaris\n\nPBS -l place=scatter\n\nPBS -l walltime=0:30:00\n\nPBS -l filesystems=home\n\nMPI example w/ 16 MPI ranks per node spread evenly across cores\n\nNNODES=wc -l < $PBS_NODEFILE\nNRANKS_PER_NODE=16\nNDEPTH=4\nNTHREADS=1",

        "question": "What is OpenMM used for in molecular mechanics simulations?",
        "cot_answer": "To answer this question, I will provide step-by-step reasoning on how OpenMM is used for molecular mechanics simulations.\n\nFirstly, OpenMM is a software framework that provides a set of tools and libraries for performing molecular mechanics simulations. It allows users to define the simulation system, specify the force field, and run the simulation using various algorithms and platforms.\n\n##begin_quote##\nmodule load cudatoolkit-standalone/11.4.4\npython benchmark.py --platform=CUDA --test=pme --precision=mixed --seconds=30 --heavy-hydrogens > test.output\n##end_quote##\n\nFrom this code snippet, we can see that OpenMM is being used to run a molecular mechanics simulation using the CUDA platform and the PME (Poisson-Boltzmann Equation) algorithm. The `benchmark.py` script is likely a part of the OpenMM framework that runs the simulation and measures its performance.\n\nAnother important step in using OpenMM for molecular mechanics simulations is building it from source, as shown in the context:\n```\n$ git checkout https://github.com/openmm/openmm.git\n$ cd openmm ; mkdir build\n$ cmake -DDOXYGEN_EXECUTABLE=/path-to/openmm/doxygen/bin/doxygen \\\n         -DSWIG_EXECUTABLE=/path-to/openmm/swig-4.0.2/bin/swig \\\n         -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path-to/openmm/build \\\n          -DCUDA_HOME=/soft/compilers/cudatoolkit/cuda-11.4.4 \\\n          -DCUDA_INCLUDE_DIR=/soft/compilers/cudatoolkit/cuda-11.4.4/include \\\n          -DCUDA_LIB_DIR=/soft/compilers/cudatoolkit/cuda-11.4.4/lib64\n$ make -j 8\n$ make install\n```\nThis shows that OpenMM is being built with CUDA support, which allows it to run simulations on NVIDIA GPUs.\n\nFinally, the context also mentions validating the installation and running benchmark tests:\n```\n$ cd /path-to/openmm/examples\n$ python -m openmm.testInstallation\n$ qsub ./submit.sh\n```\nThis suggests that OpenMM is being used for molecular mechanics simulations in a high-performance computing environment, such as a cluster or supercomputer.\n\nIn conclusion, OpenMM is used for molecular mechanics simulations by building it from source, specifying the simulation system and force field, running the simulation using various algorithms and platforms (such as CUDA), and validating the installation and performance of the simulation.\n\n<ANSWER>: OpenMM is used for molecular mechanics simulations."

One should then see the Makefile lammps-<version>/src/MAKE/MACHINES/Makefile.polaris in recent versions that can be used as a starting point for compilation on Polaris. Copies of Makefiles for building with the GPU/KOKKOS package using CUDA for GPU support with the GNU/NVHPC compiler are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo here. For older versions of LAMMPS, you may need to take an existing Makefile (e.g. Makefile.mpi) for your specific version of LAMMPS and edit the top portion appropratiately to create a new Makefile.polaris.\n\nKOKKOS package and GNU compilers\n\nThe following modules are useful for this particular build. Note, the cmake module is not required if using the GNU Makefile procedure to build LAMMPS. The initial module restore is just setting the default environment as the starting point. Users may find it useful to copy these module commands into a small helper script to assist with compiling and running LAMMPS (e.g. setup_lammps_gnu.sh).\n\n```\nmodule restore\nmodule load craype-accel-nvidia80\nmodule swap PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-gnu\n\nmodule use /soft/modulefiles\nmodule load cudatoolkit-standalone\n\nmodule load spack-pe-base cmake\n```\n\nThe top portion of Makefile.polaris_gnu_kokkos used to build LAMMPS with the KOKKOS package using GNU as the host-side compiler is shown as an example.\n\n```",

Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with TensorFlow operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the tf.keras.mixed_precision Policy, as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  If you use a custom training loop (and not keras.Model.fit), you will also need to apply loss scaling.\n\nUse TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.  Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.  When possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention.",

In this case, it will be important to have the craype-accel-nvidia80 module loaded both when compiling your application and during runtime to correctly link against a GPU Transport Layer (GTL) MPI library. Otherwise, you'll likely see GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED is requested, but GTL library is not linked errors during runtime.\n- If running on a specific GPU or subset of GPUs is desired, then the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable can be used. For example, if one only wanted an application to access the first two GPUs on a node, then setting CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 could be used.\n\nBinding MPI ranks to GPUs\n\nThe Cray MPI on Polaris does not currently support binding MPI ranks to GPUs. For applications that need this support, this instead can be handled by use of a small helper script that will appropriately set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES for each MPI rank. One example is available here where each MPI rank is similarly bound to a single GPU with round-robin assignment.\n\nA example set_affinity_gpu_polaris.sh script follows where GPUs are assigned round-robin to MPI ranks.\n\n```bash\n\n!/bin/bash -l\n\nnum_gpus=4\n\nneed to assign GPUs in reverse order due to topology",

Obviously, that gets tedious for large jobs.\n\nIf you want to control the location of a few nodes, for example 2 out of 64, but the rest don't matter, you can do something like this: -l select=1:vnode=<node name1>+1:vnode=<node name2>+62:system=foo\n\nEvery node has a PBS resource called tier0 with a rack identifier and tier1 with a dragonfly group identifieer.  If you want all your nodes grouped in a rack, you can add the group specifier -l select=8:system=foo,place=scatter:group=tier0.  If you wanted everything in the same dragonfly group, replace tier0 with tier1.  Note that you have to also explicitly specify the place when you use group.  If you wanted a specific rack or dragonfly group instead of any of them, you are back to the select: -l select 10:tier0=x3001-g0.\n\nNetwork: Rack and Dragonfly Group Mappings",

                "TensorFlow Best Practices on Polaris\n\nSingle Node Performance\n\nWhen running TensorFlow applications, we have found the following practices to be generally, if not universally, useful and encourage you to try some of these techniques to boost performance of your own applications.\n\nUse Reduced Precision. Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with TensorFlow operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the tf.keras.mixed_precision Policy, as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  If you use a custom training loop (and not keras.Model.fit), you will also need to apply loss scaling.\n\nUse TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.  Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.  When possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention.",

Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with PyTorch operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the PyTorch Automatic Mixed Precision package (AMP), as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  In PyTorch, users generally need to manage casting and loss scaling manually,  though context managers and function decorators can provide easy tools to do this.\n\nPyTorch has a JIT module as well as backends to support op fusion, similar to TensorFlow's tf.function tools.  However, PyTorch JIT capabilities are newer and may not yield performance improvements.  Please see TorchScript for more information.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nPyTorch is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with PyTorch has been seen with both DDP and Horovod.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation or the Distributed Data Parallel documentation.  Some Polaris-specific details that may be helpful to you:",

The output of this command shows that the job has been submitted and is ready to start.\n\nAnother relevant piece of information is the list of currently loaded modules at the beginning of the context. This list includes several modules related to job scheduling and queuing systems, including `craype-x86-rome`, `perftools-base`, and `cray-dsmml`.\n\nBased on this analysis, I can conclude that the module responsible for managing job scheduling on Polaris compute nodes is likely one of the following:\n\n* `craype-x86-rome`: This module appears to be related to job scheduling and queuing systems.\n* `perftools-base`: This module may also be involved in job scheduling or queuing.\n* `cray-dsmml`: This module seems to be related to job management and scheduling.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<ANSWER>: $craype-x86-rome, perftools-base, cray-dsmml"

If your build system does require GPUs, you cannot yet compile on the Polaris login nodes, as they do not currently have GPUs installed. You may in this case compile your applications on the Polaris compute nodes. Do this by submitting an interactive single-node job, or running your build system in a batch job.\n\nHome File System\n\nIs it helpful to realize that there is a single HOME filesystem for users that can be accessed from the login and computes of each production resource at ALCF. Thus, users should be mindful of modifications to their environments (e.g. .bashrc) that may cause issues to arise due to differences between the systems.\n\nCray Programming Environment\n\nThe Cray Programming Environment (PE) uses three compiler wrappers for building software.

JAX is very powerful when a program needs non-traditional autodifferentiation or vectorizatoin, such as: forward-mode AD, higher order derivatives, Jacobians, Hessians, or any combination of the above.  Users of JAX on Polaris are encouraged to read the user documentation in detail, particularly the details about pure-functional programming, no in-place operations, and the common mistakes in writing functions for the @jit decorator.\n\nJAX on Polaris\n\nJAX is installed on Polaris via the conda module, available with:\nbash\nmodule load conda; conda activate\n\nThen, you can load JAX in python as usual (below showing results from the conda/2022-07-19 module):\n\n```python\n\nimport jax\njax.version\n'0.3.15'\n\n```\n\nNotes on JAX 0.3.15\n\nOn Polaris, due to a bug, an environment variable must be set to use JAX on GPUs.

Copies of Makefiles for building with the GPU/KOKKOS package using CUDA for GPU support with the GNU/NVHPC compiler are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo here. For older versions of LAMMPS, you may need to take an existing Makefile (e.g. Makefile.mpi) for your specific version of LAMMPS and edit the top portion appropratiately to create a new Makefile.polaris.\n\nKOKKOS package and GNU compilers\n\nThe following modules are useful for this particular build. Note, the cmake module is not required if using the GNU Makefile procedure to build LAMMPS. The initial module restore is just setting the default environment as the starting point. Users may find it useful to copy these module commands into a small helper script to assist with compiling and running LAMMPS (e.g. setup_lammps_gnu.sh).\n\n```\nmodule restore\nmodule load craype-accel-nvidia80\nmodule swap PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-gnu\n\nmodule use /soft/modulefiles\nmodule load cudatoolkit-standalone\n\nmodule load spack-pe-base cmake\n```\n\nThe top portion of Makefile.polaris_gnu_kokkos used to build LAMMPS with the KOKKOS package using GNU as the host-side compiler is shown as an example.\n\n```",

For this reason, it is recommended to use start_method=\"spawn\" on Polaris when using the MpiExecLauncher as is shown in the example config above.  Alternatively, another solution is to use the GNUParallelLauncher which uses GNU Parallel to spawn processes.  GNU Parallel can be loaded in your environment with the command module load gnu-parallel.  Both of these approaches will circumvent the hang issue from using fork.\n\nUpdates\n\nFor parsl versions after July 2023, the address passed in the HighThroughputExecutor needs to be set to address = address_by_interface(\"bond0\").

                "Use XLA compilation on your code.  XLA is the Accelerated Linear Algebra library that is available in tensorFlow and critical in software like JAX.  XLA will compile a tf.Graph object, generated with tf.function or similar, and perform optimizations like operation-fusion.  XLA can give impressive performance boosts with almost no user changes except to set an environment variable TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2.  If your code is complex, or has dynamically sized tensors (tensors where the shape changes every iteration), XLA can be detrimental: the overhead for compiling functions can be large enough to mitigate performance improvements.  XLA is particularly powerful when combined with reduced precision, yielding speedups > 100% in some models.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nTensorFlow is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with tensorFlow has been seen with horovod in particular.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation.  Some polaris specific details that may be helpful to you:\n\nCPU affinity and NCCL settings can improve scaling performance, particularly at the largest scales.  In particular, we encourage users to try their scaling measurements with the following settings:\n\nSet the environment variable NCCL_COLLNET_ENABLE=1\n\nSet the environment varialbe NCCL_NET_GDR_LEVEL=PHB",

        "question": "What information needs to be manually entered when connecting to POLARIS@ANL through ParaView?",
        "cot_answer": "To answer this question, I will provide step-by-step reasoning based on the given context.\n\n**Step 1: Set up servers (first time only)**\n##begin_quote##\nThe first time you want to run a server on Polaris and have it connect to your local ParaView client, you will need to set up a Server. Once this server is set up, you can reuse it each time you run the ParaView client with the ParaView server on Polaris.\n##end_quote##\n\n**Step 2: Fetch servers**\nPress the button named \"Fetch Servers\" and select POLARIS@ANL. Windows users should select \"windows to POLARIS@ANL\". Press \"Import Selected\"\n\n**Step 3: Connect to POLARIS@ANL**\nSelect POLARIS@ANL in the File->Connect menu and press Connect\n\n**Manually entering information**\nA new window will pop up, where you need to enter the following parameters manually:\n\n* Xterm executable: the path of a terminal on your system (e.g., for Mac with XQuartz)\n* SSH executable: the name of your ssh command (may be different on Windows depending on the ssh client installed, e.g., putty)\n* Remote machine: leave this value at polaris.alcf.anl.gov\n* Username: your ALCF user name\n* ParaView version: the version of Paraview that you want to use (verify first that this version is installed on the system and add a -EGL suffix, e.g., 5.12.0-EGL)\n\n**Final answer**\n<ANSWER>: Xterm executable path, SSH command name, polaris.alcf.anl.gov, ALCF user name, ParaView version with -EGL suffix (e.g., 5.12.0-EGL)."

According to the context, it refers to the number of Polaris compute nodes that you want to use for your job. ##begin_quote##Enter the number of Polaris compute nodes you want to use for your job##end_quote##\n\nNext, I will look at the example provided in the context to see if there are any specific values mentioned. In this case, no specific value is given.\n\nTherefore, I need to provide a general answer that applies to most users. Since the question asks about \"Number of nodes to reserve\", I will assume that it refers to the number of compute nodes required for the job. This could depend on various factors such as the size and complexity of the dataset, the type of analysis being performed, and the desired level of parallelism.\n\nIn general, a good starting point would be to enter a value that is slightly larger than the minimum required for your specific use case. For example, if you need 2 nodes for your job, you could start with 3 or 4 nodes to allow for some flexibility and to account for any potential issues that may arise during the job execution.\n\n<ANSWER>: Enter a value that depends on your specific use case, but a good starting point would be slightly larger than the minimum required."

For performance, it will likely be necessary to ensure that each application runs on a distinct set of CPU resources and/or targets specific GPUs. One can provide a list of CPUs using the --cpu-bind option, which when combined with CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES provides a user with specifying exactly which CPU and GPU resources to run each application on. In the example below, four instances of the application are simultaneously running on a single node. In the first instance, the application is spawning MPI ranks 0-7 on CPUs 24-31 and using GPU 0. This mapping is based on output from the nvidia-smi topo -m command and pairs CPUs with the closest GPU.\n\n```bash\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:24:25:26:27:28:29:30:31 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:16:17:18:19:20:21:22:23 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:8:9:10:11:12:13:14:15 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=3\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:0:1:2:3:4:5:6:7 ./hello_affinity &\n\nwait\n```\n\nCompute Node Access to the Internet\n\nCurrently, the only access the internet is via a proxy.

For performance, it will likely be necessary to ensure that each application runs on a distinct set of CPU resources and/or targets specific GPUs. One can provide a list of CPUs using the --cpu-bind option, which when combined with CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES provides a user with specifying exactly which CPU and GPU resources to run each application on. In the example below, four instances of the application are simultaneously running on a single node. In the first instance, the application is spawning MPI ranks 0-7 on CPUs 24-31 and using GPU 0. This mapping is based on output from the nvidia-smi topo -m command and pairs CPUs with the closest GPU.\n\n```bash\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:24:25:26:27:28:29:30:31 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:16:17:18:19:20:21:22:23 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:8:9:10:11:12:13:14:15 ./hello_affinity &\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=3\nmpiexec -n 8 --ppn 8 --cpu-bind list:0:1:2:3:4:5:6:7 ./hello_affinity &\n\nwait\n```\n\nCompute Node Access to the Internet\n\nCurrently, the only access the internet is via a proxy.

A Balsam Site runs on a node with access to the job scheduler, where it can submit and monitor jobs. Overall job state is aggregated on the Balsam Server, making job data from all Sites accessible from any individual site (or the user's laptop), via the command-line interface or the Python API. To get information on how to use the command line tool, you can type balsam --help in your shell.\n\nFull documentation for Balsam is available online.\n\nBalsam requires Python 3.7+. To install Balsam on Polaris, first set up a virtual Python environment:\n\nshell\nmodule load conda\nconda activate base\npython -m venv env\nsource env/bin/activate\npip install --upgrade pip\npip install --pre balsam\n\nTo use Balsam, users need an account on the Balsam server.  Users can get an account by contacting the ALCF Help Desk.  Once a user has an account, they can login and make a new site.  A Balsam site is a project space for your workflow. You will be prompted to select what machine (Polaris) you are working on when creating a new site:\n\nshell\nbalsam login\nbalsam site init -n new-site new-site\ncd new-site\nbalsam site start\n\nSee the Balsam documentation for full details.",

For instance, if only your head node needed public access your select statement might looks something like: -l select=1:pubnet=True+63.\n\nControlling Where Your Job Runs\n\nIf you wish to have your job run on specific nodes form your select like this: -l select=1:vnode=<node name1>+1:vnode=<node name2>... . Obviously, that gets tedious for large jobs.\n\nIf you want to control the location of a few nodes, for example 2 out of 64, but the rest don't matter, you can do something like this: -l select=1:vnode=<node name1>+1:vnode=<node name2>+62:system=foo\n\nEvery node has a PBS resource called tier0 with a rack identifier and tier1 with a dragonfly group identifieer.  If you want all your nodes grouped in a rack, you can add the group specifier -l select=8:system=foo,place=scatter:group=tier0.  If you wanted everything in the same dragonfly group, replace tier0 with tier1.  Note that you have to also explicitly specify the place when you use group.  If you wanted a specific rack or dragonfly group instead of any of them, you are back to the select: -l select 10:tier0=x3001-g0.\n\nNetwork: Rack and Dragonfly Group Mappings",

Note that if you import mpi4py or horovod, and then do something like os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = hvd.local_rank(), it may not actually work!  You must set the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable prior to doing MPI.COMM_WORLD.init(), which is done in horovod.init() as well as implicitly in from mpi4py import MPI.   On Polaris specifically, you can use the environment variable PMI_LOCAL_RANK (as well as PMI_LOCAL_SIZE) to learn information about the node-local MPI ranks.\n\nDeepSpeed\n\nDeepSpeed is also available and usable on Polaris.  For more information, please see the DeepSpeed documentation directly.\n\nPyTorch DataLoader and multi-node Horovod\n\nPlease note there is a bug that causes a hang when using PyTorch's multithreaded data loaders with distributed training across multiple nodes.

Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with TensorFlow operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the tf.keras.mixed_precision Policy, as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  If you use a custom training loop (and not keras.Model.fit), you will also need to apply loss scaling.\n\nUse TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.  Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.  When possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention.",

                "PyTorch Best Practices on Polaris\n\nSingle Node Performance\n\nWhen running PyTorch applications, we have found the following practices to be generally, if not universally, useful and encourage you to try some of these techniques to boost performance of your own applications.\n\nUse Reduced Precision. Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with PyTorch operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the PyTorch Automatic Mixed Precision package (AMP), as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  In PyTorch, users generally need to manage casting and loss scaling manually,  though context managers and function decorators can provide easy tools to do this.\n\nPyTorch has a JIT module as well as backends to support op fusion, similar to TensorFlow's tf.function tools.  However, PyTorch JIT capabilities are newer and may not yield performance improvements.  Please see TorchScript for more information.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nPyTorch is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with PyTorch has been seen with both DDP and Horovod.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation or the Distributed Data Parallel documentation.  Some Polaris-specific details that may be helpful to you:",

The Cray MPI wrappers will handle this automatically.\n\nNotes on Default Modules\n\ncraype-x86-rome: While the Polaris compute nodes currently have Milan CPUs, this module is loaded by default to avoid the craype-x86-milan module from adding a zen3 target not supported in the default nvhpc/21.9 compilers. The craype-x86-milan module is expected to be made default once a newer nvhpc version (e.g. 22.5) is made the default.\n\ncraype-accel-nvidia80: This module adds compiler flags to enable GPU acceleration for NVHPC compilers along with gpu-enabled MPI libraries as it is assumed that the majority of applications to be compiled on Polaris will target the GPUs for acceleration. Users building cpu-only applications may find it useful to unload this module to silence \"gpu code generation\" warnings.\n\nMixed C/C++ & Fortran Applications\n\nFor applications consisting of a mix of C/C++ and Fortran that also uses MPI, it is suggested that the programming environment chosen for Fortran be used to build the full application because of mpi.mod (and similar) incompatibilities.\n\nCompiling for GPUs",

                "Running GPU-enabled Applications\n\nGPU-enabled applications will similarly run on the compute nodes using the above example script.\n- The environment variable MPICH_GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED=1 needs to be set if your application requires MPI-GPU support whereby the MPI library sends and receives data directly from GPU buffers. In this case, it will be important to have the craype-accel-nvidia80 module loaded both when compiling your application and during runtime to correctly link against a GPU Transport Layer (GTL) MPI library. Otherwise, you'll likely see GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED is requested, but GTL library is not linked errors during runtime.\n- If running on a specific GPU or subset of GPUs is desired, then the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable can be used. For example, if one only wanted an application to access the first two GPUs on a node, then setting CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 could be used.\n\nBinding MPI ranks to GPUs\n\nThe Cray MPI on Polaris does not currently support binding MPI ranks to GPUs. For applications that need this support, this instead can be handled by use of a small helper script that will appropriately set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES for each MPI rank. One example is available here where each MPI rank is similarly bound to a single GPU with round-robin assignment.\n\nA example set_affinity_gpu_polaris.sh script follows where GPUs are assigned round-robin to MPI ranks.\n\n```bash\n\n!/bin/bash -l\n\nnum_gpus=4\n\nneed to assign GPUs in reverse order due to topology",

If you wanted everything in the same dragonfly group, replace tier0 with tier1.  Note that you have to also explicitly specify the place when you use group.

This can be done by following the instructions provided in the context: \"Let's add some of our other data back into the scene. Let's start with the particle data.\" ##begin_quote## All of the particles are displayed as red points in the graphics window. There are ~39K particles in this particular data set, which makes the display rather cluttered. In order to both filter some of these out, and create 3D representations for them, we will apply the glyph filter to this data. ##end_quote## This suggests that applying a glyph filter is necessary to visualize particle data as glyphs.\n\nTo do so, we can follow the steps provided in the context: \"Unhide the particles.000*data: click Eye icon.\" This implies that hiding or unhiding certain data points is necessary to apply the glyph filter.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<ANSWER>: Glyphs are a way of visually representing particle data by applying a glyph filter to the data, which allows us to filter out some particles and create 3D representations for them."

We can use the same Blue to Red Rainbow preset as before, but this time, we'll adjust the range of values to correspond to the velocity values of our RBCs.\n\nFor example, if healthy RBCs have a velocity above 0.5, we can color them green (a bright and healthy color).

Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with TensorFlow operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the tf.keras.mixed_precision Policy, as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  If you use a custom training loop (and not keras.Model.fit), you will also need to apply loss scaling.\n\nUse TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.  Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.  When possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention.",

If build your application is problematic for some reason (e.g. absence of a GPU), then users are encouraged to build and test applications directly on one of the Polaris compute nodes via an interactive job. The discussion below makes use of the NVHPC compilers in the default environment as illustrative examples. Similar examples for other compilers on Polaris are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo.\n\nCPU MPI+OpenMP Example\n\nOne of the first useful tasks with any new machine, scheduler, and job launcher is to ensure one is binding MPI ranks and OpenMP threads to the host cpu as intended. A simple HelloWorld MPI+OpenMP example is available here to get started with.\n\nThe application can be straightforwardly compiled using the Cray compiler wrappers.\nCC -fopenmp main.cpp -o hello_affinity\n\nThe executable hello_affinity can then be launched in a job script (or directly in shell of interactive job) using mpiexec as discussed here.\n\n```\n\n!/bin/sh\n\nPBS -l select=1:system=polaris\n\nPBS -l place=scatter\n\nPBS -l walltime=0:30:00\n\nPBS -l filesystems=home\n\nMPI example w/ 16 MPI ranks per node spread evenly across cores\n\nNNODES=wc -l < $PBS_NODEFILE\nNRANKS_PER_NODE=16\nNDEPTH=4\nNTHREADS=1",

In this case, it will be important to have the craype-accel-nvidia80 module loaded both when compiling your application and during runtime to correctly link against a GPU Transport Layer (GTL) MPI library. Otherwise, you'll likely see GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED is requested, but GTL library is not linked errors during runtime.\n- If running on a specific GPU or subset of GPUs is desired, then the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable can be used. For example, if one only wanted an application to access the first two GPUs on a node, then setting CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 could be used.\n\nBinding MPI ranks to GPUs\n\nThe Cray MPI on Polaris does not currently support binding MPI ranks to GPUs. For applications that need this support, this instead can be handled by use of a small helper script that will appropriately set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES for each MPI rank. One example is available here where each MPI rank is similarly bound to a single GPU with round-robin assignment.\n\nA example set_affinity_gpu_polaris.sh script follows where GPUs are assigned round-robin to MPI ranks.\n\n```bash\n\n!/bin/bash -l\n\nnum_gpus=4\n\nneed to assign GPUs in reverse order due to topology",

In this case, it will be important to have the craype-accel-nvidia80 module loaded both when compiling your application and during runtime to correctly link against a GPU Transport Layer (GTL) MPI library. Otherwise, you'll likely see GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED is requested, but GTL library is not linked errors during runtime.\n- If running on a specific GPU or subset of GPUs is desired, then the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable can be used. For example, if one only wanted an application to access the first two GPUs on a node, then setting CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 could be used.\n\nBinding MPI ranks to GPUs\n\nThe Cray MPI on Polaris does not currently support binding MPI ranks to GPUs. For applications that need this support, this instead can be handled by use of a small helper script that will appropriately set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES for each MPI rank. One example is available here where each MPI rank is similarly bound to a single GPU with round-robin assignment.\n\nA example set_affinity_gpu_polaris.sh script follows where GPUs are assigned round-robin to MPI ranks.\n\n```bash\n\n!/bin/bash -l\n\nnum_gpus=4\n\nneed to assign GPUs in reverse order due to topology",

Many compiler vendors provide implementations of the OpenMP specification (https://www.openmp.org/specifications).\n\nSetting the environment to use OpenMP on Polaris\n\nMany of the programming environments available on Polaris have OpenMP support.\n\nmodule OpenMP CPU support?

To switch to other modules, you can use module switch.\n\nUsing PrgEnv-nvhpc\n\nThis is loaded by default, so there's no need to load additional modules. You can confirm that it is loaded by running module list to check that PrgEnv-nvhpc is in the list.\n\nUsing LLVM\n\nTo use the LLVM module, load the following.\nmodule load mpiwrappers/cray-mpich-llvm\nmodule load cudatoolkit-standalone\n\nSee the the LLVM compiling page here for more information.\n\nUsing PrgEnv-gnu\n\nTo switch from PrgEnv-nvhpc to PrgEnv-gnu you can run:\n\nmodule switch PrgEnv-nvhpc PrgEnv-gnu",

If you wanted everything in the same dragonfly group, replace tier0 with tier1.  Note that you have to also explicitly specify the place when you use group.  If you wanted a specific rack or dragonfly group instead of any of them, you are back to the select: -l select 10:tier0=x3001-g0.\n\nNetwork: Rack and Dragonfly Group Mappings",

The context provides information about the output, including lines that start with `MPI`, `OMP`, and `HWT`.\n2. The `MPI` prefix suggests that these lines are related to MPI (Message Passing Interface), a programming model for parallel computing.\n3.

A Balsam Site runs on a node with access to the job scheduler, where it can submit and monitor jobs. Overall job state is aggregated on the Balsam Server, making job data from all Sites accessible from any individual site (or the user's laptop), via the command-line interface or the Python API. To get information on how to use the command line tool, you can type balsam --help in your shell.\n\nFull documentation for Balsam is available online.\n\nBalsam requires Python 3.7+. To install Balsam on Polaris, first set up a virtual Python environment:\n\nshell\nmodule load conda\nconda activate base\npython -m venv env\nsource env/bin/activate\npip install --upgrade pip\npip install --pre balsam\n\nTo use Balsam, users need an account on the Balsam server.  Users can get an account by contacting the ALCF Help Desk.  Once a user has an account, they can login and make a new site.  A Balsam site is a project space for your workflow. You will be prompted to select what machine (Polaris) you are working on when creating a new site:\n\nshell\nbalsam login\nbalsam site init -n new-site new-site\ncd new-site\nbalsam site start\n\nSee the Balsam documentation for full details.",

The context provides information about the nodes and GPUs available on the system.\n2. The example code provided is written in C++ and uses the oneAPI framework, which includes support for CUDA.\n3. To compile and run the code, we need to load the necessary modules and set environment variables.\n\nFrom the context, we can see that the following modules are loaded:\n\n* `oneapi/upstream`\n* `mpiwrappers/cray-mpich-oneapi-upstream`\n* `craype-accel-nvidia80`\n\nThese modules provide support for oneAPI, MPI, and NVIDIA CUDA. We also need to set the environment variable `MPICH_GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED` to 1 to enable GPU support in MPICH.\n\nFinal Answer:\n<ANSWER>: The environment variables that need to be loaded before compiling and running a CUDA-based code using this supercomputer's MPI implementation are: `oneapi/upstream`, `mpiwrappers/cray-mpich-oneapi-upstream`, `craype-accel-nvidia80`, and `MPICH_GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED=1`."

If build your application is problematic for some reason (e.g. absence of a GPU), then users are encouraged to build and test applications directly on one of the Polaris compute nodes via an interactive job. The discussion below makes use of the NVHPC compilers in the default environment as illustrative examples. Similar examples for other compilers on Polaris are available in the ALCF GettingStarted repo.\n\nCPU MPI+OpenMP Example\n\nOne of the first useful tasks with any new machine, scheduler, and job launcher is to ensure one is binding MPI ranks and OpenMP threads to the host cpu as intended. A simple HelloWorld MPI+OpenMP example is available here to get started with.\n\nThe application can be straightforwardly compiled using the Cray compiler wrappers.\nCC -fopenmp main.cpp -o hello_affinity\n\nThe executable hello_affinity can then be launched in a job script (or directly in shell of interactive job) using mpiexec as discussed here.\n\n```\n\n!/bin/sh\n\nPBS -l select=1:system=polaris\n\nPBS -l place=scatter\n\nPBS -l walltime=0:30:00\n\nPBS -l filesystems=home\n\nMPI example w/ 16 MPI ranks per node spread evenly across cores\n\nNNODES=wc -l < $PBS_NODEFILE\nNRANKS_PER_NODE=16\nNDEPTH=4\nNTHREADS=1",

A Balsam Site runs on a node with access to the job scheduler, where it can submit and monitor jobs. Overall job state is aggregated on the Balsam Server, making job data from all Sites accessible from any individual site (or the user's laptop), via the command-line interface or the Python API. To get information on how to use the command line tool, you can type balsam --help in your shell.\n\nFull documentation for Balsam is available online.\n\nBalsam requires Python 3.7+. To install Balsam on Polaris, first set up a virtual Python environment:\n\nshell\nmodule load conda\nconda activate base\npython -m venv env\nsource env/bin/activate\npip install --upgrade pip\npip install --pre balsam\n\nTo use Balsam, users need an account on the Balsam server.  Users can get an account by contacting the ALCF Help Desk.  Once a user has an account, they can login and make a new site.  A Balsam site is a project space for your workflow. You will be prompted to select what machine (Polaris) you are working on when creating a new site:\n\nshell\nbalsam login\nbalsam site init -n new-site new-site\ncd new-site\nbalsam site start\n\nSee the Balsam documentation for full details.",

        "cot_answer": "The purpose of this code snippet is to compare the results of two different matrix multiplication operations: one using the OneAPI MKL library and another using the CBLAS library. The code checks if the results are identical by iterating over each element of the matrices and comparing them. If any mismatch is found, it prints an error message and returns -1. If no mismatches are found, it prints a success message and returns 0.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\nThe code starts by initializing some variables: `MismatchFound` to false, and then defining two nested loops that iterate over each element of two matrices `c_A` and `c_B`. For each element, it checks if the values are different using an `if` statement. If they are different, it sets `MismatchFound` to true.\n\nAfter the loops finish, the code checks the value of `MismatchFound`. If it's still false, that means all elements were identical, so it prints a success message and returns 0. If `MismatchFound` is true, that means some elements were different, so it prints an error message and returns -1.\n\nThe rest of the code defines some variables and arrays for matrix multiplication using the OneAPI MKL library, but this part is not directly related to the purpose of the code snippet.\n\n<ANSWER>: The purpose of this code snippet is to compare the results of two different matrix multiplication operations."

The code prepares two matrices, A and B, and then performs matrix multiplication using both CBLAS and OneMKL.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the line of interest**\nThe line `sycl::queue q(sycl::property_list{sycl::property::queue::in_order{}});` is the one that needs to be analyzed. This line creates a SYCL (OpenCL) queue, which is used for executing kernel functions on a device.\n\n**Step 3: Understand the role of the queue**\nThe queue `q` is used to execute the OneMKL matrix multiplication kernel function. The `sycl::property_list{sycl::property::queue::in_order{}}` argument specifies that the queue should be created with in-order execution enabled, which means that kernels will be executed in the order they are submitted.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the code**\nThe code uses the queue to allocate memory for matrices A and B on the device (`A_dev` and `B_dev`) and then copies the host data to these devices using `q.memcpy()`. The OneMKL matrix multiplication kernel function is executed on the device, and the result is copied back to the host.\n\n**Step 5: Draw conclusions**\nThe role of the queue is to enable execution of the OneMKL matrix multiplication kernel function on a device. This allows for parallel computation and acceleration of the matrix multiplication operation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n<ANSWER>: The `sycl::queue q(sycl::property_list{sycl::property::queue::in_order{}});` line creates a SYCL queue that enables execution of the OneMKL matrix multiplication kernel function on a device, allowing for parallel computation and acceleration."

For device-side arrays `A_dev`, `B_dev`, and `C_dev_onemkl`, you can use the `sycl::free()` function to release the memory allocated for devices.\n\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning:\n\n##begin_quote##\n  delete[] A;\n  delete[] B;\n  delete[] C_cblas;\n  delete[] C_host_onemkl;\n  sycl::free(A_dev, q);\n  sycl::free(B_dev, q);\n  sycl::free(C_dev_onemkl, q);\n##end_quote##\n\nBy using `delete[]` for host-side arrays and `sycl::free()` for device-side arrays, you ensure that the memory allocated for both hosts and devices is properly deallocated.\n\n<ANSWER>: The memory deallocation in OpenCL is handled by using the standard C++ delete operator (`delete[]`) for host-side arrays and the `sycl::free()` function for device-side arrays."

                "Containers on Polaris\n\nPolaris, powered by NVIDIA A100 GPUs, benefits from container-based workloads for seamless compatibility across NVIDIA systems. This guide details the use of containers on Polaris, including custom container creation, large-scale execution, and common pitfalls.\n\nApptainer Setup\n\nPolaris employs Apptainer (formerly known as Singularity) for container management. To set up Apptainer, run:\n\nbash\nmodule use /soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/install/modulefiles/Core\nmodule load apptainer\napptainer version #1.2.2\n\nThe Apptainer version on Polaris is 1.2.2. Detailed user documentation is available here\n\nBuilding from Docker or Argonne GitHub Container Registry\n\nContainers on Polaris can be built by writing Dockerfiles on a local machine and then publish the container to DockerHub, or by directly building them on ALCF compute node by writing an Apptainer recipe file. If you prefer to use existing containers, you can pull them from various registries like DockerHub and run them on Polaris.\n\nSince Docker requires root privileges, which users do not have on Polaris, existing Docker containers must be converted to Apptainer. To build a Docker-based container on Polaris, use the following as an example:",

For example, the -cuda flag instructs nvcc to compile .cu input files to .cu.cpp.ii output files which are to be separately compiled, whereas the same -cuda flag instructs nvc, nvc++, and nvfortran to enable CUDA C/C++ or CUDA Fortran code generation. The resulting output file in each case is different (text vs. object) and one may see unrecognized format error when -cuda is incorrectly passed to nvcc.\n\nKnown Issues and Workarounds\n\nIf you are using nvcc to invoke nvc++ and compiling C++17 code, and are seeing the following warning and unable to compile C++17 constructs:\n\n```\npolaris-login-01(~)> nvcc --std=c++17 -ccbin nvc++ ~/smalltests/bool_constant.cpp\nnvcc warning : The -std=c++17 flag is not supported with the configured host compiler.

For this reason, it is recommended to use start_method=\"spawn\" on Polaris when using the MpiExecLauncher as is shown in the example config above.  Alternatively, another solution is to use the GNUParallelLauncher which uses GNU Parallel to spawn processes.  GNU Parallel can be loaded in your environment with the command module load gnu-parallel.  Both of these approaches will circumvent the hang issue from using fork.\n\nUpdates\n\nFor parsl versions after July 2023, the address passed in the HighThroughputExecutor needs to be set to address = address_by_interface(\"bond0\").

        "cot_answer": "To answer this question, I will provide step-by-step reasoning on how to set `KOKKOS_HOME` environment variable in a Makefile.\n\nReasoning:\nThe context provides information about building a Kokkos application using CMake. It also mentions that the `KOKKOS_HOME` environment variable is set via a module load command: `module load kokkos`. This suggests that `KOKKOS_HOME` is an environment variable that points to the directory where the Kokkos library is installed.\n\nTo set this environment variable in a Makefile, we can use the following syntax:\n```\nexport KOKKOS_HOME = /path/to/kokkos/installation\n```\nThis sets the `KOKKOS_HOME` environment variable to the specified path. We can then use this variable in our Makefile to link against the Kokkos library.\n\n##begin_quote##\nYou can look at the first lines of $KOKKOS_HOME/KokkosConfigCommon.cmake to see the flags used in cmake configuration of the kokkos library build.\n##end_quote##\n\nThis suggests that we need to set the `KOKKOS_HOME` environment variable before building our application. We can do this by adding the following line to our Makefile:\n```\nexport KOKKOS_HOME = $(shell module load kokkos; echo $KOKKOS_HOME)\n```\nThis sets the `KOKKOS_HOME` environment variable to the path returned by the `module load kokkos` command.\n\nFinal Answer: <ANSWER>: The purpose of setting `KOKKOS_HOME` environment variable in a Makefile is to point to the directory where the Kokkos library is installed, allowing us to link against the library and use its features."

If you want all your nodes grouped in a rack, you can add the group specifier -l select=8:system=foo,place=scatter:group=tier0.  If you wanted everything in the same dragonfly group, replace tier0 with tier1.  Note that you have to also explicitly specify the place when you use group.  If you wanted a specific rack or dragonfly group instead of any of them, you are back to the select: -l select 10:tier0=x3001-g0.\n\nNetwork: Rack and Dragonfly Group Mappings",

This can be inferred from the fact that there are multiple object files (OBJS) being linked together to form the final executable (example1_polaris).\n\nTo determine which backends are being built, I will examine the object file names. The object file names are obtained by substituting \".cpp\" with \".o\" for each source file (.cpp). This is done using the $(subst .cpp,.o,$(SRCS)) command.\n\nThe object files are: example1.o\n\nSince there is only one object file, it implies that only one backend is being built. However, this does not match the expected three backends (OpenMP, Serial, and Cuda).\n\nTo resolve this discrepancy, I will examine the Makefile rules provided in the context.\n\nThe Makefile rule for building example1_polaris specifies the following command:\n\n$$(CXX) $(LDFLAGS) -o example1_polaris $(OBJS) $(LDLIBS)\n\nThis command links the object file (example1.o) with some libraries and flags to form the final executable.\n\nHowever, this does not provide any information about which backend is being built. To determine this, I will examine the CMake configuration files (not provided in the context).\n\nIn a typical CMake configuration, the backends are specified using variables such as KOKKOS_ENABLE_CUDA or KOKKOS_ENABLE_OPENMP.\n\nUnfortunately, the context does not provide any information about these variables. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which three backends are being built using the provided CMake configuration.\n\n<ANSWER>: Unknown"

                "Use XLA compilation on your code.  XLA is the Accelerated Linear Algebra library that is available in tensorFlow and critical in software like JAX.  XLA will compile a tf.Graph object, generated with tf.function or similar, and perform optimizations like operation-fusion.  XLA can give impressive performance boosts with almost no user changes except to set an environment variable TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2.  If your code is complex, or has dynamically sized tensors (tensors where the shape changes every iteration), XLA can be detrimental: the overhead for compiling functions can be large enough to mitigate performance improvements.  XLA is particularly powerful when combined with reduced precision, yielding speedups > 100% in some models.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nTensorFlow is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with tensorFlow has been seen with horovod in particular.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation.

This consists of running the ParaView client on your local resource, and the ParaView server on the Polaris compute nodes. The ParaView client needs to first be installed on your local resource, and needs to match the version that you run on Polaris.\n\nThere are multiple versions of ParaView installed on Polaris. To find the versions of ParaView currently available on Polaris run the following command on a login node: \nmodule use /soft/modulefiles\nmodule avail paraview\n\nBinary and source packages of the ParaView client for Linux, MacOS, and Windows are available from the ParaView Download Page.\n\nConnecting to the ParaView server on Polaris\n\nThis section describes how to launch the ParaView server on Polaris from a local ParaView client.\n\nStart ParaView Client\n\nFirst, launch the ParaView client on your local resource. You will need to configure some server settings in the client. This initial set up should only need to be done once, and can be reused each time you want to run ParaView on Polaris.\n\nServer Configuration\n\n1.

In this case, we're interested in knowing how many devices are being used.\n\nFrom the context, we can see that `omp_get_num_devices()` is called with no arguments. This function returns the number of devices available for OpenMP parallelization.\n\nIn the code, we have a target region marked with `!$omp target`. This region is executed on each device (i.e., accelerator) in parallel. The `flag` variable is used to determine whether the current device is the initial device or not.\n\nThe key line that answers our question is: `write(,) \"Number of devices:\", omp_get_num_devices()`\n\nThis line prints the number of devices available for OpenMP parallelization, which is 4 in this case.\n\n##begin_quote##\n    write(,) \"Number of devices:\", omp_get_num_devices()\n##end_quote##\n\nBased on my reasoning and the context, I conclude that:\n\n<ANSWER>: 4"
