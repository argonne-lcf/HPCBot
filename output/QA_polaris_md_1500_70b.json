Overall job state is aggregated on the Balsam Server, making job data from all Sites accessible from any individual site (or the user's laptop), via the command-line interface or the Python API. To get information on how to use the command line tool, you can type balsam --help in your shell.\n\nFull documentation for Balsam is available online.\n\nBalsam requires Python 3.7+.

Note that if you import mpi4py or horovod, and then do something like os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = hvd.local_rank(), it may not actually work!  You must set the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable prior to doing MPI.COMM_WORLD.init(), which is done in horovod.init() as well as implicitly in from mpi4py import MPI.   On Polaris specifically, you can use the environment variable PMI_LOCAL_RANK (as well as PMI_LOCAL_SIZE) to learn information about the node-local MPI ranks.\n\nDeepSpeed\n\nDeepSpeed is also available and usable on Polaris.

A Balsam Site runs on a node with access to the job scheduler, where it can submit and monitor jobs. Overall job state is aggregated on the Balsam Server, making job data from all Sites accessible from any individual site (or the user's laptop), via the command-line interface or the Python API. To get information on how to use the command line tool, you can type balsam --help in your shell.\n\nFull documentation for Balsam is available online.\n\nBalsam requires Python 3.7+. To install Balsam on Polaris, first set up a virtual Python environment:\n\nshell\nmodule load conda\nconda activate base\npython -m venv env\nsource env/bin/activate\npip install --upgrade pip\npip install --pre balsam\n\nTo use Balsam, users need an account on the Balsam server.  Users can get an account by contacting the ALCF Help Desk.  Once a user has an account, they can login and make a new site.  A Balsam site is a project space for your workflow. You will be prompted to select what machine (Polaris) you are working on when creating a new site:\n\nshell\nbalsam login\nbalsam site init -n new-site new-site\ncd new-site\nbalsam site start\n\nSee the Balsam documentation for full details.",

Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with PyTorch operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the PyTorch Automatic Mixed Precision package (AMP), as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  In PyTorch, users generally need to manage casting and loss scaling manually,  though context managers and function decorators can provide easy tools to do this.\n\nPyTorch has a JIT module as well as backends to support op fusion, similar to TensorFlow's tf.function tools.  However, PyTorch JIT capabilities are newer and may not yield performance improvements.  Please see TorchScript for more information.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nPyTorch is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with PyTorch has been seen with both DDP and Horovod.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation or the Distributed Data Parallel documentation.  Some Polaris-specific details that may be helpful to you:",

Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with TensorFlow operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the tf.keras.mixed_precision Policy, as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  If you use a custom training loop (and not keras.Model.fit), you will also need to apply loss scaling.\n\nUse TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.  Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.  When possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention.",

Existing binaries are unlikely to run successfully.\n\nWe have held all jobs submitted prior to the upgrade as a user hold. Users may release their existing jobs with qrls to run after they have rebuilt their binaries.\n\nPBS does cache the job execution script.  If a change to the script is required due to a path changing post rebuild, the job will have to be resubmitted.\n\nAll application binaries should be rebuilt prior to further job submissions.\n\nRe-building user codes\n\nMany user codes will need to be re-built and/or re-linked against the newer version of the programming environment (23.12) and Spack provided dependencies.\n\nChanges to the user software environment",

Obviously, that gets tedious for large jobs.\n\nIf you want to control the location of a few nodes, for example 2 out of 64, but the rest don't matter, you can do something like this: -l select=1:vnode=<node name1>+1:vnode=<node name2>+62:system=foo\n\nEvery node has a PBS resource called tier0 with a rack identifier and tier1 with a dragonfly group identifieer.  If you want all your nodes grouped in a rack, you can add the group specifier -l select=8:system=foo,place=scatter:group=tier0.  If you wanted everything in the same dragonfly group, replace tier0 with tier1.  Note that you have to also explicitly specify the place when you use group.  If you wanted a specific rack or dragonfly group instead of any of them, you are back to the select: -l select 10:tier0=x3001-g0.\n\nNetwork: Rack and Dragonfly Group Mappings",

XLA will compile a tf.Graph object, generated with tf.function or similar, and perform optimizations like operation-fusion.  XLA can give impressive performance boosts with almost no user changes except to set an environment variable TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2.  If your code is complex, or has dynamically sized tensors (tensors where the shape changes every iteration), XLA can be detrimental: the overhead for compiling functions can be large enough to mitigate performance improvements.  XLA is particularly powerful when combined with reduced precision, yielding speedups > 100% in some models.\n\nMulti-GPU / Multi-Node Scale up\n\nTensorFlow is compatible with scaling up to multiple GPUs per node, and across multiple nodes.  Good scaling performance has been seen up to the entire Polaris system, > 2048 GPUs.  Good performance with tensorFlow has been seen with horovod in particular.  For details, please see the Horovod documentation.

This guide details the use of containers on Polaris, including custom container creation, large-scale execution, and common pitfalls.\n\nApptainer Setup\n\nPolaris employs Apptainer (formerly known as Singularity) for container management. To set up Apptainer, run:\n\nbash\nmodule use /soft/spack/gcc/0.6.1/install/modulefiles/Core\nmodule load apptainer\napptainer version #1.2.2\n\nThe Apptainer version on Polaris is 1.2.2. Detailed user documentation is available here\n\nBuilding from Docker or Argonne GitHub Container Registry\n\nContainers on Polaris can be built by writing Dockerfiles on a local machine and then publish the container to DockerHub, or by directly building them on ALCF compute node by writing an Apptainer recipe file. If you prefer to use existing containers, you can pull them from various registries like DockerHub and run them on Polaris.\n\nSince Docker requires root privileges, which users do not have on Polaris, existing Docker containers must be converted to Apptainer.

If your build system does require GPUs, you cannot yet compile on the Polaris login nodes, as they do not currently have GPUs installed. You may in this case compile your applications on the Polaris compute nodes. Do this by submitting an interactive single-node job, or running your build system in a batch job.\n\nHome File System\n\nIs it helpful to realize that there is a single HOME filesystem for users that can be accessed from the login and computes of each production resource at ALCF. Thus, users should be mindful of modifications to their environments (e.g. .bashrc) that may cause issues to arise due to differences between the systems.\n\nCray Programming Environment\n\nThe Cray Programming Environment (PE) uses three compiler wrappers for building software. These compiler wrappers should be used when building MPI-enabled applications.\n\ncc - C compiler\n\nCC - C++ compiler\n\nftn - Fortran compiler\n\nEach of these wrappers can select a specific vendor compiler based on the PrgEnv module loaded in the environment.

                "TensorFlow Best Practices on Polaris\n\nSingle Node Performance\n\nWhen running TensorFlow applications, we have found the following practices to be generally, if not universally, useful and encourage you to try some of these techniques to boost performance of your own applications.\n\nUse Reduced Precision. Reduced Precision is available on A100 via tensorcores and is supported with TensorFlow operations.  In general, the way to do this is via the tf.keras.mixed_precision Policy, as descibed in the mixed precision documentation.  If you use a custom training loop (and not keras.Model.fit), you will also need to apply loss scaling.\n\nUse TensorFlow's graph API to improve efficiency of operations.  TensorFlow is, in general, an imperative language but with function decorators like @tf.function you can trace functions in your code.  Tracing replaces your python function with a lower-level, semi-compiled TensorFlow Graph. More information about the tf.function interface is available here.  When possible, use jit_compile, but be aware of sharp bits when using tf.function: python expressions that aren't tensors are often replaced as constants in the graph, which may or may not be your intention.",

The craype-x86-milan module is expected to be made default once a newer nvhpc version (e.g. 22.5) is made the default.\n\ncraype-accel-nvidia80: This module adds compiler flags to enable GPU acceleration for NVHPC compilers along with gpu-enabled MPI libraries as it is assumed that the majority of applications to be compiled on Polaris will target the GPUs for acceleration. Users building cpu-only applications may find it useful to unload this module to silence \"gpu code generation\" warnings.\n\nMixed C/C++ & Fortran Applications\n\nFor applications consisting of a mix of C/C++ and Fortran that also uses MPI, it is suggested that the programming environment chosen for Fortran be used to build the full application because of mpi.mod (and similar) incompatibilities.\n\nCompiling for GPUs",

It consists of a base stack (spack-pe-base)\nand PrgEnv-dependent stacks (currently spack-pe-gnu).\n\nspack-pe-base contains commonplace software compiled for CPU with the system\nGCC compilers. Accordingly, the software in spack-pe-base can be used\nregardless of programming environment.\n\nspack-pe-gnu is based on the E4S Project and\nprovides performant HPC libraries built with PrgEnv-gnu and the nvcc CUDA\ncompiler driver for GPU code. spack-pe-gnu is dependent on both\nspack-pe-base and PrgEnv-gnu.\n\nUsing software from the Spack PE\n\nThe base suite of software tools and libraries can be accessed by loading the\nspack-pe-base module. This adds a path to $MODULEPATH which contains\nnumerous modules.\n\nFor example, to load cmake starting from the default environment, a user\nshould run the following commands:\nmodule use /soft/modulefiles\nmodule load spack-pe-base\nmodule load cmake\n\nThe spack-pe-base module adds paths to the user's MODULEPATH; individual packages are subsequently loaded through the newly available modules. The full list of available packages can be viewed by running module avail or module --show-hidden avail for a complete listing. Packages are loaded in the same way from spack-pe-gnu.\n\nInspecting packages",
