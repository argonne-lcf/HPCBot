Don't change the contents of the \"Machine file\" field (it should be $PBS_NODEFILE).\n3. The default Launch Profile is set to serial, but using the parallel method to launch jobs on Polaris is recommended.\n4. Don't change the contents of \"launchMethod\". It must be `qsub/aprun` even though Polaris does not use `aprun`.\n5. If you'd like to change other job parameters (like the number of processes, nodes, and walltime), you can do so. Please enter time in the format required by the PBS scheduler (i.e 1:00:00 for one hour).\n6. Save these changes if you'd like them to be used as your default under the Options menu.",
